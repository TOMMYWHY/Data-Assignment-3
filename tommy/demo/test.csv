I had to get used to the style of this movie in that Veronica narrated it, her texts would appear almost as 'bubbles' on the screen from time to time and there were a lot of characters I did not know from the tv series, which I have seen but a long time ago and didn't remember all of them. No matter. I quickly adapted to these and instead enjoyed the mystery.The film corrected one thing and this is a SPOILER. At the beginning of the film she is with a guy and they were an item but it was very clear to me they had no real chemistry. It was with Logan you instantly saw the chemistry. Well, enough said on that.Kristen Bell is outstanding in the lead and I liked everyone in this film.It is beautifully shot, too. I was very impressed with the overall look of the film. Someone called it 'low budget'? Don't believe it. You won't find a ton of CGI shots but if that is your idea of low budget then you need to expand your horizons.Nice music, too.I am hoping they make more Veronica Mars films.",5,I was wrong about this,1399507200,"05 8, 2014"

A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00150OTCE,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","The Orphanage is a ghost story in the classic tradition [at various times whilst watching this I was reminded of some of my other favorite ghost stories such as The Changeling, The Others, and at one point, even Dark Water, the Japanese version]. It is high on atmosphere [the imposing gothic mansion in a remote location, sinister looking people, mysterious noises] and has a riveting plot.The story centers around Laura [Belen Rueda] who has moved into her childhood home, an orphanage, with her husband Carlos [Fernando Cayo] a doctor, and their 7 year old son Simon [Roger Princep] who like most children his age has an overactive imagination and an abundance of imaginary friends.They settle in nicely into the old mansion until one day when they go down to the beach to play - Simon lingers in a cave and when Laura comes to get him, he claims he was talking to a 'friend' and even leaves a trail of seashells so that his friend, Tomas can follow him back to the house. At first Laura dismisses Simon's ramblings as the figment of his imagination but soon comes to fear a more sinister  force at play as a game of  'find the treasure' seems much too elaborate to have been cooked up by Simon, revealing a secret that she wishes to keep from Simon.The story gets truly going when a party to welcome the newcomers [Laura and Carlos had decided to take in about 5-6 children into their home, all with some sort of disability] results in the tragic disappearance of Simon [who had opted to play with his imaginary friend than join in the festivities]. The rest of the story centers around Laura's desperate attempts to find her son, even resorting to hiring psychics [one played by Geraldine Chaplin in a very credibly portrayed role] whilst her husband plays the role of the skpetic, refusing to believe in any supernatural explanation for Simon's disappearance.There are some truly chilling moments in this movie - the sinister child with a sack over its face watching Laura in a darkened hallway, mysterious banging sounds that waken Laura at night,the psychic summoning and the discovery of some of the house's old secrets - all these add to the storyline and keep viewers engaged. Though the acting itself is not extraordinary, except perhaps for Belen Rueda's convincing mother in distress Laura, and Geraldine Chaplin's psychic, this is not an issue for the real pull of the movie lies in the subtle unfolding of the plot through a series of 'clues' that lead Laura to what she seeks.A highly recommended ghost story that doesn't rely on any gore, sex or unnecessary special effects, but allows the natural light and atmosphere coupled with some very effective old school effects to tell a classic ghost story.",5,A classic multi-faceted ghost story,1208822400,"04 22, 2008"
A1FEITLECMZ6EW,B001CB8NQE,Jeffrey Thomas,"[0, 0]","Spoilers included:This episode is unique, in my opinion. I'll state this now, in case I'm mixing up episodes. I have seen this but I'm reviewing after not having seen it in a while. So, don't be to hard.The whole idea of Teyla having an alteration to be a Wraith for the time being is really interesting. Especially how Todd manipulates events to his wants. I do enjoy Teyla's use of her authoritative position at the end where she warns Todd about her coming back in the event that he does something that she would not want him to. She can be very intimidating when she wants to be.I won't say much more, but I'll give good points on the creativity of the episode and the acting. Teyla, the actor playing her more specifically, did an excellent job. I can't imagine dealing with having to put all that make-up on.However, I'm going to stop there, as I'm not really one to delve into the actors themselves, other than to rate them as something along the lines of good or bad.Anyway, the episode was very good. It put Todd in a position of power whilst taking down the Queen. However, even though the Wraith to Human potion, as I'll call it, didn't get to go into place, I think it flows with the episodes. With it, it would cut the series short, and that would put a downer on our want for more.So, the Wraith war continues. Good episode. I hope people continue to enjoy the series.Just to note in ending, I'll apologize now if any of this information is out of place. As I pointed out in the beginning, I haven't watched this episode in a while. I wanted to write a review and give stars to this episode so that people would know it was good, instead of just seeing one star.Ok, hope you like the series.",5,Very Interesting,1345680000,"08 23, 2012"

ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001PN63PC,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Over at `The Film Experience', Nathanial Rogers (possibly the best Oscar internet blogger out there) has been posting a ""Best In Show"" column for certain actors (or actresses) in films and while watching `Two Lovers' I felt inspired to write my own.When considering the film `Two Lovers', first time viewers may immediately suspect that the two Oscar names (Joaquin Phoenix and Gwyneth Paltrow) would be the obvious choices for `best is show' praise, but upon the actual viewing it is apparent that there is one performance so subtle yet so alarmingly in tune with her character that one cannot help but obsess over her.Yes, I'm talking about Vinessa Shaw.Vinessa plays Sandra, a young and kind hearted woman who seeks out a relationship with Leonard.  Sandra's father has recently conducted a business merger with Leonard's father, and after a brief observance (Sandra sees Leonard asking his mother to dance while at work) she asks her father to set up a meeting between them.  She thinks he is cute.  Leonard has problems (serious ones that involve the cancellation of a wedding and multiple suicide attempts) but these are aspects of his tortured soul that intrigue Sandra.  She wants to help him, to heal him.When they first meet her candor is endearing.  She is not as shy or reclusive as Leonard, but she has a natural unnaturalness about her demeanor.  When she feels that maybe her advances are not being met with approval she immediately recants, pulling back and apologizing for him, basically telling him not to worry about not wanting to `date' her until he leans in and kisses her and she is consumed.""Oh my god.""  Those were her words.  She utters that phrase twice in the film and both times carry so much internal weight.As their relationship grows you can see a spark in Sandra, but that spark is corroded by a `knowing', a sixth sense if you will, that something is not right.  When Leonard is getting strange phone calls and becoming more and more reclusive, pulling away yet never saying what it is that is truly on his mind, you can see that Sandra knows, but she is unwilling to confront it for fear of losing him.  She doesn't want it to be real.That's why the second ""oh my god"" carries so much weight, because you can tell that she isn't quite sure she believes her own eyes.While `Two Lovers' is, sadly, more about one lover (that lover being Michelle, the generically clich&eacute;d `troubled girl'), the one who stays with you through every frame is Sandra.  Sure, she is vanilla while Michelle (Leonard's drug addicted neighbor who is shacking up with a married man and almost instantaneously becomes Leonard's sole obsession) is certainly not, but the textural approach that Shaw took to this character makes her scream to life.  She understands how to make Sandra's love for Leonard seem real and sincere.Now that I've devoted much of my praise to a singular performer, I guess I should weigh in on the movie itself.  While I found it stirring and most defiantly engaging, there are things about `Two Lovers' that felt off kilter.  Leonard as a character is a little two unstable and underdeveloped.  We know there is tragedy there, and Phoenix does a remarkable job of balancing his characters `new life' with the `old one' (this is far from a melodramatic downer), but the script doesn't really allow for us to KNOW who Leonard really is or understand why these women are so into him.  I felt that shifting focus to the relationship between Leonard and Michelle was a mistake, for the real emotional crux of the film is between Leonard and Sandra.  The ending, while not surprising (I totally saw that coming) can read a little false, but it also was one of those moments where, upon reflection, probably says more about Leonard as a person than any other moment in the film.He doesn't really know what he wants.The film is flawed, but it is also memorable.  It is quiet yet it has moments that sting and stay with you.  It also has Shaw.  Oh how I weep for her lack of awards attention last year.",4,I'll take your first lover and the check please...,1288915200,"11 5, 2010"

It's noir-esque with flashes of color sort of like sky captain but it just feels like a competent sci-fi flick.  You won't care about the characters, the plot is kind generic and doesn't really make sense, but it's not supposed to...this is a popcorn flick that never made it to theaters with a TON of recognizable stars.  The most impressive fact is that most of the imagery wasn't cgi but scaled models with green screen acting.I, honestly, watch a lot of ""B"" movies.

I don't give this the full 5 star rating because the episodes aren't broken down into just one long film.

However, I'd like to point out a few things on the down side; 1- the murders are extremely grizzly with lots of blood and mutilated corpses at every episode, which is in sharp contrast to the supposedly peaceful villages where they occurred. 2 - The reasons that caused the villagers to murder others are very trivial and petty most of the time. 3 - The murderers are the most unlikely people; like an 80 years old woman who is a retired school teacher, an angel-faced 14 years old girl etc. people who have lived clean and decent lives in a nice peaceful village suddenly go berserk for some petty reason and start butchering their neighbors.So obviously the writers achieve their goal - it's just about impossible to guess who done it, but it made me feel let down in the end of every episode.Anyway, like I said - it is an enjoyable show never the less, just take off your thinking cap and enjoy the blood fest...",3,Enjoyable BUT...,1323216000,"12 7, 2011"

The writing and directing were problematic at best.  I suspect the main problem was the radical departure from the history.  It was difficult to integrate the drama fiction into the history and by the end of the movie I felt the direction of the plot had become absurd.  At the same time, the film crew obviously did an outstanding job and the actors were first rate.

I've seen one Star Trek film, and to be honest I can't remember which one it was (one of the 90's ones); I do remember I wasn't overly impressed.  Not my cup of tea, you could say.  However, I've enjoyed J.J. Abrams's films (don't watch TV; sorry folks!), and loved Chris Pine in SMOKIN' ACES, so I figured STARK TREK was a sure-fire delight.  I was right.I won't rehash the plot, because while there IS one, it's so convoluted that I couldn't possibly hope to get it right; it involves time travel, and a sinister-looking Eric Bana (underused and underwritten, unfortunately) who has a grudge against pretty much everyone, but especially Spock, played with jaw-dropping aplomb by Zachary Quinto (and also a much-welcomed Leonard Nimoy; I told you this was a weird plot).  Along for the ride are names that Trekkies will recognize: Dr. Bones McCoy (Karl Urban at his finest); Uhura (Zoe Saldana); Scottie (Simon Pegg, also underused); Sulu (John Cho); and others.  Bruce Greenwood is a delight as always as the rugged Captain who belies in Kirk no matter what, and Anton Yelchin manages to steal most of his scenes as Checkov (much as he did in the recent TERMINATOR film).The other major star here are the special effects, and I must say, they are not lacking.  This is a heart-pounding ride, an action film in the old-school vein of quick wit and terrific explosions.  What keeps it from drowning in its twisted plot is the script, Abrams's spot-on direction, and Chris Pine as the lead role.  Pine shows he can be an action star with depth, a genuinely good actor in a role usually reserved for those with more muscles than talent.  Overall, STAR TREK is a pure and utter delight; it's not quite a classic, though I'm sure sci-fi fans my argue for it (and I won't stop them).  I'm not sure how it appeals to Trekkies, but for someone like myself, who's new to the series, this film is a kick-a** ride, and not one to be missed.",5,An action/adventure romp for fans and non-fans alike.,1258243200,"11 15, 2009"

A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B003L4Q0UQ,William Amazzini,"[1, 2]","In this modern day world of computers, Facebook, Tweeters ,Etc. , Imagination is slowly becoming passe.  Fantasy films are still being made with the CGI effect as a safety net but many of them have expunged the 'Once Upon A Time' otherworldly feeling one should experience becoming one with the tale. Writer/director Neil Jordan has resurrected the 'Once Upon A Time' once again by unleashing a modern day fairytale on a jaded film going audience.  He did it once before with his excellent film 'THE COMPANY OF WOLVES' and now does it with 'ONDINE' the most beautiful, mesmerizing piece of cinema released this past year. The Irish countryside is far more breathtaking than a computerized backdrop.  By combining myths with modern day alienation from human roots, Jordan spins a tale of a fisherman who is barely getting by in his small Irish town.  Separated from his wife and father to a dying little girl, his paralysed existence is shattered when one day he catches a beautiful woman in his fishing net.  While trying to separate the myth-(his little girl thinks the woman is a Selkie- a seal creature of Scottish legend) from reality, he hopelessly falls in love and cannot cope with the good fortune that comes his way.  Naturally, a big bad wolf arrives to throw a wrench in the proceedings. Colin Farrell continues to show us what a wonderful thespian he truly is and Alicia Bacheleda is intoxicating as the strange woman.  The scene stealer is Alison Barry as the little girl, Annie, who's presence is felt throughout the proceedings even when not on screen. There is nothing more shattering than a child supporting a parent based on the sheer courage and unwavering faith in the enormity of this love and gift that came from the sea.  With breathtaking photography by Christopher Doyle and an ethereal music score combining traditional Irish ballads, 'ONDINE' is a jewel among the countless remakes and sequels being unleashed on the cinema going public.  As one critic from the Minneapolis Star Tribune stated "" ONDINE is so good that it hurts"".  I couldn't have said it better myself.",5,A Neil Jordan Modern Day Fairytale,1285977600,"10 2, 2010"

The most implausible thing is their earbud communicators - the size of an in ear hearing aid with limitless range, the batteries never die either), the good guys always win, even though they're usually in trouble along the way.

Watch the extras, in one of which tough guy Eliot gets decked by a little girl.One thing I've noticed, a little bit unusual for a TV series set, is that the episodes are not subtitled ( in reading over a couple of the other reviews I see that others have commented on that), the packaging doesn't mention it but I've found that if your TV is set for closed captioning display you'll get the text just as you would've on the original TV broadcast.I like the way each episode is titled, dated and briefly described- when 4th season was released the studio took away the dates and descriptions which makes locating a favorite episode difficult if you don't happen to remember the specific title.In episode #10 &#34;The Underground Job&#34;, the gang is told that the place to get lunch is &#34;Carver's, just down the road&#34;.

All the elements are there and blend well.The actors are well chosen to match the characters and the acting is bang on. The sets were perfect and not distracting from the story.There are several approaches one can take while telling a story. One is like Tony Hillerman who usually has two parallel stories that have characters periodically crossing each other and may not converge in the end. The other is the worlds within worlds approach as with the book ""Sophie's World"" or the film ""The Thirtieth Floor"" (1999). This story was more standard mystery with the usual suspects that all could be guilty. All the clues are there and the butler does not come out of the closet just before the end. Yet in the end, we get not one twist but a series of plausible twists. Leave it to a Mathematician.In the film we get a statement ""I believe in Pi"" this give away the armatureness of the math section of the film as everyone in industry knows the  Pi (~.7854816) is the formula to convert form one geometric figure to another look it up. You do not need a calculator if you remember 7854 in your head.The story starts with a famous woman being murdered, no doubt, about it, two people find the body and a mysterious mathematical clue points to possible future murders.

A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B003XU02QG,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[5, 6]","CENTURION (2010, 97 minutes) is a fine endless battle-and-chase-and-battle-and-final-gigantic-showdown-battle Roman-era film. That is, if you like this sort of meaningless tripe action film. Set in 117 A.D., and as always centering on the mysteriously vanished 9th Legion, Michael Fassbender actually gives an unusually riveting performance as Centurion Quintus Dias. That's right, they gave him a Spanish name that probably wasn't even in existence yet, but Romans will be Romans in whatever century they occupy.Of course, as I translate the only-half-authentic Roman name, it is symbolic: I narrowed its translation to either a literal ""Five Days"" or the much more humorous, symbolic ""Days [are] Numbered"". An even funnier way to read it is ""How Many Days"" and I assume that should end with a question mark. Yep. ""Quintus Dias"" does it to me every time.Here, north of Hadrian's then-new wall, Dias and only a few others survive horrific, gore-laced battles with the Picts (who amazingly speak modern Irish Gaelic, right down to the Anglicized mispronunciations, instead of speaking Pictish, which language is a mystery to us anyway).I began laughing as they were haunted and hunted by a vicious, supernatural Pictish woman called Etaine (wrongly credited as ""Etain"", a Goth makeup nightmare by the name of Olga Kurylenko). Those ladies were tough fighters but they weren't like this. This lady mows down Romans as if they were Legos.There isn't much for me to add to this. There are just too many other films running along these lines, such as the equally ghastlyKing Arthur(2004, see my review),300(2006), the excellent family filmThe Last Legion(2007, see my review) and the equally excellent and underratedThe Eagle(2011, see my review). Of these, THE EAGLE and THE LAST LEGION are by far the finest.I was very impressed by the beautiful Imogen Poots who plays Arianne, the outcaste Pictish witch. Actually she is a healer who got the bad end of the stick - much like Dias will discover he's getting from the Empire after he gets back home. Though here agin a major stumble, since she is altogether far too reminiscent of Sam Neill inMerlin (Special Edition)(see my review).One thing I can say I am heartily sick of seeing is the set of common refrains running through these films (I back down from 300 because I have no time for a film like that): you can always count on stupid anachronisms galore, phony Celtic peoples (""Hey, why not make 'em all Irish?""), a Roman on a stupid quest, other colorful foreigners fighting with the Roman on his stupid quest, badly spoken Gaelic or Gobbledygook, Ice Age weather, very bad history overall, vast oceans of blood, violent battles that go on too long and finally, Romans deciding Britain is the pure land and defecting from the Empire.Oh, and let us not forget Hadrian's Wall, which is a bit like the obligatory pratfall in every comedy. It is poetic, a little bit of it is occasionally true - for the most part it is a repetitive bore to see that stuff repeated ad nauseam. Hey! Maybe they should have named Fassbender's Roman soldier Ad Nauseam. Better than Your Days Are Numbered.My recommendation is you watch the other films I mentioned before you see this one. You may find once you've seen a bit of it that you don't want to waste your time watching regurgitations. Then again, you just might develop a bit of a soft spot in your heart for this thing, as I did.It was the really good Roman-era Arthurian film (THE LAST LEGION) and the stunning quasi-gay-Roman-plus-Celt-love story (THE EAGLE) that created that soft spot.

But power, politics and money can certainly overcome the truth.ALL GOOD THINGS changes the names but retains the bizarre facts or probabilities of this still unsolved mystery.  What happened to David Marks (Durst's) lovely young bride?  Who killed his longtime author friend?  Was the death of his new buddy really in self defense?  After new evidence surfaced in the late 2000's, the writers of ALL GOOD THINGS offers some truly evocative--and credible--solutions.I was truly impressed with this movie.  Its use of voice-over narrative is tastefully used and moves the plot along.  While the main thrust of the film focuses on David and Kathy's stormy marriage, the script accommodates the related crimes quite efficiently.And what a cast!  Ryan Gosling is marvelous as the multi-layered David--charming, volatile, manipulative, haunted and ultimately dangerous.  Kirsten Dunst's Oscar-worthy performance as Kathy is devastating.  In her best performance to date, she inhabits the role with overwhelming depth.  Her tragic descent is captured in every facial expression and her desperate pleadings.

Since I was familiar with the Hoarders format, family reaches out to clinical psychologist, clean up is set and clinical psychologist helps the hoarder and their family through whatever issues come up during the clean up process, ending in either the family and the hoarder or the hoarder alone continuing going to therapy after the cleanup. Specific to animal hoarders, the use of local humane society or SPCA's were used to rescue the animals. For the episodes I found that there was slow play back which was annoying since it was evident that the content was loading but took somewhere between two to seven minutes to properly load. This issue occurred at least twice within one episode. Obviously there are similarities between Hoarders and Animal Hoarders, in how they respond to different life events in the form of &#34;collecting/accumulating&#34; either animals or what they deem &#34;valuable&#34; items.",3,Slow Playback and Technical Issues,1388275200,"12 29, 2013"

But first off this is a tale set shortly after the American Civil War, focusing on a Confederate veteran who is seeking several men who did his deceased wife wrong. Turns out these people have gone west to work for the railroad company looking to reach the Pacific Ocean by a certain point. Of course, the tale branches off into several subplots and layered relationships. Colm Meaney, who some might remember from STAR TREK, is best known to me and plays an investor with a stake in this venture as it will hopefully make him his fortune. The outfits and looks of things feel right though the dialogue at times feels a bit too modern. It's slow in the beginning but that's because they're developing several subplots which will eventually overlap. There's some good coverage of relations between Irish and former slaves which is well done and has a great deal of truth to it for the era (both sides were competing for similar jobs), as well as the effects Manifest Destiny had upon the American Indians in the way (anybody else recognize a certain actor from LAST OF THE MOHICANS?) of progress. There are also some nice contradictions in the series, like evangelists preaching alongside hookers at work and talk of fair wages amidst rampant racism. For Deadwood fans I'd say this is better than the third season but certainly not the first and arguably a notch down from the second season. Budgetary concerns kept out Chinese Americans which got criticisms. The show is hoping to rectify this in the second season but it all depends on finances.

A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B007C7UI8S,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 4]","The end of the third series had been dramatic with the killing of Mitchell by George. But nothing is simple in this fourth series. Nina has disappeared because after giving birth to a girl she does not have time to name she is destroyed by some vampiristic mob. George is paranoid about the prediction that the baby is the saviour of humanity and has to be killed by the vampires when they come to take over the world, he understands it as if she had to be killed for vampires to be able to take over. He is unable to survive very long in that paranoia and thus he leaves Annie and the baby with an unfinished job, in his mind at least. If he knew the truth he would really be frightened. But the house is a real crossroads for vampires, werewolves and ghosts, provided they are all detached from the real monstrous things they may represent and they are trying to live human lives.A young werewolf comes back, Tom , and he is known of us so he is easily accepted and integrated even before George disappears. But he is still a kid and he has to learn how to fight and kill vampires since werewolves have that divine task to do.The vampire is more difficult to find. He is Hal, but in fact this is a nickname and they learn in due time he is an old one who has decided to leave the flock and wean himself, which he has been doing for fifty five years now, a short time after all when compared to the extreme length of his living dead survival he calls a life.  And being this old one he is also the future king of the vampires when they take the world over. He is Prince Harry, a common name for a prince since Shakespeare and quite popular nowadays.But this series has a new tone in a way because it is the series in which the old ones are coming to take over the world and they have to be destroyed. But the problem is the prediction. The baby called Eve by George on his death bed is the saviour of humanity. But is she the one who can protect humanity by being alive against the vampires? Or is she the one who can stop and destroy all the old ones by dying? Or is she the one who can open the gates to vampires by dying? The same question is at the heart of these questions: must Eve live and protect humanity or die and save humanity as well as destroy the old ones?In fact this question is not even accurate. Little by little we know the baby Eve has to die but the real question is how? Especially when the ghost of an eighteen year old Eve comes up into the picture to explain to Annie why she, Eve, must die.Of course it is all more complicated than that and our three main heroes will be joined by the ghost of Alex, a girl Hal had courted a little bit and who was killed by a certain Cutler, a vampire obsessed by making history and who trapped Harry into drinking her blood, which send Harry back on a frenzy of submissiveness to the oldest one of them all, the one from whom all vampire DNA comes and who finally arrives on earth to fulfil the prophecy.To spice up the tale we have flash-forwards into the future as it is going to be if the vampires take over. Something pretty scary since human beings will have to be eliminated except the number necessary to feed the vampires. Humanity will become the bleeding cattle of the newcomers. This is very similar to the means used in other series or in novels to achieve the same objective: to make the heroes save the present because there is no future without a present that is alive and well. I am thinking of Terminator of course, the whole saga, including the TV series of the John Connor's mother's diaries. I am thinking of Supernatural in which angels and archangels send the heroes Dean and Sam into the future the way it would be if they did not accept to play the game of the Apocalypse. I am thinking of many science-fiction books by Stephen King and others, including Ron L. Hubbard, that use the vision of the future to make us understand that we have to save the present.But here the present can only be saved by Annie, Tom and Hal. And it is saved of course, and the baby is sacrificed to save humanity. And it is the fire of god that does the business. They forgot to tell us clearly that this fire came from god but we can subsume it all by ourselves, can't we? The old ones will be destroyed of course because there are two ways to destroy vampires, a stake in the heart or fire. Now you have to watch the eight episodes if you want to know how and where and when and by whom.Three survivors: Hal, Tom and Alex, a phenomenal m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois with an immediate emergency: to wean Hal from his having drunk some blood. We also discover another type of humans, but are they humans, people or beings who are supposed to keep the secret hidden and to collect all the evidence they can and that could reveal that secret to the world: the world is under the menace from vampires and among us we have quite a few vampires and werewolves. Those we can see, though the vampires are invisible in mirrors and cameras and telephone webcams, etc. The third type of monsters, if they are monsters of course, are ghosts and those are invisible, sorry folks, there must always be a cheater somewhere in any games and ghosts are the cheaters, and we are the losers of course.Who will win in the next series? The vampires, the werewolves or the ghosts? I am ready to bet on werewolves because they are sexy animals, whereas ghosts are immaterial and vampires are killing machines and blood suckers. Though the series is discreet about the intimate life of the heroes, when speaking of suction, there is better and more pleasurable things to do than suck blood. At least George was a practising believer as for that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Hot in our private mental parts,1344902400,"08 14, 2012"

Unable to figure out what he wants initially it becomes obvious this guy wants something from them and that seems to be to watch them suffer as he does things to get inside and kill them.Its a simple premise and a bit like Colin Farrell's ""Phone Booth"" in that for most of the film its centralized to just the ATM location with the three panicking friends and the killer on the outside. The cast is also pretty typical as the three friends are played by (Alice Eve ""She's Out of My League"", Brian Geragthy ""Jarhead"" and Josh Peck TV's ""Drake & Josh"") as is the killer who really does nothing more than stand outside looking menacing and well of course kills.There are plenty of problems with this movie, namely one being the viewer constantly thinking ""Just run to the car, you can take him"" especially in the early going when the guy goes around the back of the building. It becomes clear what the motives are behind this game the guy is playing with the three people none of which is terribly shocking I guess. Its hard to do a movie from one location and while I give director David Brooks (in his feature debut) props for trying something different there really isn't enough tension to keep the movie going for a full length running time. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",2,Too many withdrawals from this 'ATM',1345939200,"08 26, 2012"

Lily Cole was excellent in her role as the new girl; she portrayed a definite creepiness, using minute facial movements and deadpan stares that were still filled with menace.

AYG1U47VFZ165,B0080CKV72,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[3, 5]","Note to Hollywood and beyond: I've really grown tired with trick endings.  It isn't that I don't like then because, frankly, I do.  It's that most of them aren't done all that well any longer.  As a matter of fact, once you know you're trapped inside a motion picture that undoubtedly will have a trick ending (the first giveaway is that you can tell one's coming), then you begin w-a-t-c-h-i-n-g the film yet you stop watching the story.  You find yourself glancing at shadows.  You listening for verbal clues to secret identities or dropped Easter eggs.  You're seeing that body over in the corner of the screen, and you're wondering, ""Hey, why is it the director never shows me who that dead guy is over there?""  At that point, it's stopped being a legitimately entertaining experience and started being an exercise in cognitive reasoning ... and that's not the reason I spun the disc in the first place!(NOTE: the following review will contain spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of character and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I suggest you skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're comfortable with a few hints of `things to come,' then read on ...)George (played nicely by the reliable Rupert Evans) is a down-on-his-luck musician who - in order to make ends meet - takes a job as `chef' at the local insane asylum.  (Where did he get such a romantic background and why is it he can only find a job cooking at a virtual prison?  Ah, ah, ah!  Don't start looking so closely so soon, viewer!)  In order to make his existence a bit more palatable, he somehow manages to have all of the members of his band also hired at the said institution.  (Wait a minute ... how exactly does that happen?  Ah, ah, ah!  I warned you about thinking too much about the plot!)  But before you can say `twaddle,' a freak electric storm knocks out all power to the normally secured building (AND the back-up generators?!?!), and George and his friends are left locked behind bars with time running out on their own sanity as the inmates seize control!  (Well, how in the Sam Hill is that even remotely ... FOR THE LAST TIME, DIDN'T I WARN YOU TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT?!?!)ASYLUM BLACKOUT didn't make much sense from the get-go, but, to its strengths, it's certainly grounded in some solid work by all the players, a wonderfully moody atmosphere complete with all of the usual `locked box' scenarios, and some fine dark'n'gritty filmmaking.  Were that enough, I'd probably be willing to give it more than a respectable two-and-one-half stars (most of which is solely for some solid technical and acting prowess); but, sadly, all of it revolves around a central conceit of the trick ending.  I couldn't tell you exactly when I started to suspect exactly ""What"" was going on - it's fairly predictable as a trick ending, I might add - though, based on my description of the plot, methinks you can tell it was early on.Narratively, it is structured very well.  It's a tidy 90 minutes, broken into clear thirds like a classic three-act play.  The first 30 minutes is set-up of all the players; the second 30 is when the black-out occurs and everything goes downhill fast; while the final 30 clearly begins pointing toward the ruse you'll probably see coming.  Suffice it to say, folks aren't exactly what they seem ... but the critical failure of the particular subterfuge of S. Craig Zahler and Jerome Fansten's script is that, by the final third, there's no room left for subtlety.  What should play out as mind games end up being something fairly close to torture porn - a plot device used way too frequently in horror films these days.To further beat the dead horse, the dodge they use makes little sense to the chronology of the film: the final moments are a book-ended revisitation of the picture's opening segment, forcing you - the viewer - to suddenly realize what you may have just seen may, in fact, NOT be what you just saw.  While others might find this `genius' or `groundbreaking,' I found it more than a bit fraudulent.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  It's probably a one-off picture for most people (meaning it's worth a single viewing).  The ultimate problem with ASYLUM BLACKOUT isn't in its performances or execution; rather, it's in its conception.  Given the nature of the story - think of a really good episode of `The Twilight Zone' that went too far - is that once you know the ending, you have to re-evaluate everything you've seen heading up to it.  When you look too closely at the seams, then suddenly you realize you're W-A-T-C-H-I-N-G a movie instead of being immersed in one - the way you are a really good book.  Instead of enjoying it, you realize that you've been duped - and not in a good way - only now you've wasted the last 90 minutes and can't get `em back ... which is kinda/sorta like what happens to George.",2,2 and  Stars: ASYLUM BLACKOUT Could've Used A Bit More Bright Light,1356998400,"01 1, 2013"
A31BBNT8C62MLU,B0083IJGBU,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[0, 0]","This is a staple of my video library, paid some outrageous sum for it on DVD years ago, I've watched it dozens of times, for me the quintessential Pride and Prejudice. I supplement or complement my viewing with other versions, but this one for me is the gold standard, the best of them all.  I'm a Jane Austen admirer and naturally go for versions most in keeping with her books.  Though this one deviates from the book in several ways (the wet shirt scene, for one!), Colin Firth is so phenomenal as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle as Lizzie, and the other characters are so similarly vivid and well-acted (e.g., Jane, Mr. Bingley, everybody), it makes up for it.The one I find truest to the book, and with a more spirited (er, oppositional, impertinent, self-possessed) Lizzie and a more restrained Darcy, is the 1980Pride and Prejudice (BBC Miniseries)(free to stream for Prime members right now).  Despite the less posh production values, there were several things I preferred in this version, the mother's character for one (though I like Allison Steadman, I don't care for the depiction of Mrs. Bennet in the Firth-Ehle version, SO annoying).  And, the 1980 offering included a number of scenes from the book not found in the Firth-Ehle version, to round out one's P&P; experience.  This version develops the characters more fully (except for Jane), for example, Lydia, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (below).***MANY SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Austen was brilliant and there's a LOT going on in her books, so, not easy to capture it all in any one film reproduction.  Just one example, is the complexity of Mr. Bennet.  Although he loves Lizzie, he's quite a jerk, insults his wife and other daughters constantly, isn't happy with his lot in life and fancies himself superior to others (perhaps with little justification).  He married Mrs. Bennet, a flirt and the belle of the ball, because he was sexually attracted to her, but rapidly lost interest.  The extent to which that dynamic is revealed was better captured in the 1980 version, I thought.  In the Firth-Ehle version, Mrs. Bennett is presented as an overwrought  drama-queen, frequently overcome by ""my poor nerves"".  Mr. Bennet's frequent retreat to his library, and even his sarcastic remarks (often at her expense) are seen as simple reactions to that, understandable.In fact, Austen makes it clear that Mr. Bennet's pettiness, lack of love for and support of his wife, his dismissive attitude towards her, his air of superiority and ENDLESS messing with, er, ""trifling"" with her head, are not justified by and are far more egregious faults in Lizzie's eyes than those displayed by her mother.  These issues are all tied up in the twin notions of being of good character and marrying out of love and/or regard for the other in the first place, instead of merely what you can GET from them.  Indeed, a central theme of the book is Lizzie and Darcy improving each other, that's what good relationships do.  (I think the marriage of Charlotte and Mr. Collins fits that bill too, re: basic regard/respect for each other and them improving one another, ultimately a happy union.)  Another Austen theme is honesty, self-examination, which Darcy evinces in abundance, but Mr. Bennet only rarely.  Another point of contrast between them is the care and solicitude Darcy evinces towards his errant sister, taking his share of the responsibility, unlike Mr. Bennet.  Indeed, the couple of times Mr. Bennet IS honest and admitting of error, it's such a big deal Austen underlines it, in effect (to be seen in both versions).Though Lizzie loves her father dearly, she doesn't hold him in especially high regard, and in a very effective scene in this version, the line: ""He [Darcy] is the best of men.  He is truly the BEST man I have ever known..."" is added, not in the original text, nor were Mr. Bennet's tears, but it's bittersweet because her father is hurt, yet happy for his Lizzy.  And it's doubly poignant because, not only has she found a man with all the qualities her father lacks, but miracle of miracles, she LOVES him and he her!  And SUCH a surprise, because he initially seemed such a cad.  This is just one thread of MANY in the tale, and it is intriguing to me how different versions embody both the actual content of Austen's books and her implications, her incisive and canny characterizations.  I watch different film versions to partake of the different details provided by each, for me they complement each other nicely.  The entire scene from the book in which Lizzie tells her father she loves Darcy is omitted from the 1980 film, oddly, but for me made up for by its ending, closely paralleling the book, in which Elizabeth and Darcy quietly discuss how they fell in love.  Both adaptations have their strengths.Another film (mini-series) that for me virtually channels Jane Austen [her marvelous language, her wry wit] isLost in Austen, in which a modern day reader accidentally gets transported into the story, swapping lives with Lizzie- intriguing, marvelous (though events transpire VERY differently).  If you like time travel movies and Jane Austen, don't miss it.This Pride and Prejudice was my favorite BBC-type production for many years, and I still love it, butNorth & Southhas replaced it as my absolute favorite.  It's about a woman who moves from the bucolic South of England to Yorkshire, might as well be the moon (where men and women actually shake hands, and say what they mean, unbelievable).  She soon meets cryptic, driven, smoldering Richard Armitage, and the sparks fly.  Romantically, it has many of the same themes as Pride and Prejudice, but told in a different way- it's no comedy of manners, no dances and flirting and game-playing, instead, full of existential and life or death issues and class struggles (against the backdrop of the Industrial Revolution, which exploded in the north, transforming society), it's ALIVE with longing and romantic promise, as well as the heady sense of a brand new age.  PHENOMENAL.  I watched it on instant video and immediately bought the DVD.Anyway, if you haven't seen this, watch it, I think you'll love it as I do, and if you get the Jane Austen bug, you might then trySense And Sensibility,EmmaandPersuasion, all favorites, though Persuasion was Austen's last book and most mature work, rather quiet and introspective, slow-moving.

AFUHVCBFHXB89,B008947J8U,Colonel D,"[2, 3]","Taking a popular fictional series and adapting it to fit a one-hour television format has to be a daunting task.  Sure, it's been done with some success such as Robert B. Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone or Tony Hillerman's  Chee & Leaphorn novels (though except Spenser the other's were 2-hour movies).With A&E;'s ""Longmire"" they have taken Craig Johnson's present-day sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming and brought him to the small screen.  If you never read Johnson's excellent stories you probably wouldn't find much to complain about.  But, as other reviewers have noted if you have read them you are in for a disappointing and befuddling experience.Casting is key; Robert Taylor looks the part of Walt Longmire.  For the most part the actor does a credible job portraying the character that is written fairly true to the books.  Mr. Taylor doesn't seem comfortable wearing a firearm though; he's always resting his hand on the butt of his pistol, kind of a rookie move for an ex-Marine and long time peace officer.  Not sure looking like you're about to ""pull"" on everyone you talk to is a good strategy.  Katee Sackhoff has been critiqued by others in her role as under sheriff ""Vic"" Moretti but mostly for being blonde instead of brunette.  Hair color aside my problem with her is she's just not obnoxious enough as she should be, more of a ""Vic-Lite"".  The biggest problem with the cast is the critical person of ""The Cheyenne Nation"" (as Walt calls him in the novels), Henry Standing Bear.  In the books Henry is a large man and an imposing physical presence and Lou Diamond Phillips, while a fine actor, lacks the sheer physicality to pull this off.For the readers familiar with the Longmire tales one of the more disorienting features of Season 1 is they start off each episode with almost exact recreation of the crime from one of Craig Johnson's books.  Naturally you think, ""oh, I know where this is heading"" but actually you don't as the screen writers then abandon Johnson's work and concoct a totally different set of circumstances.  It would be OK if the alternative solution was as good as the original but it never is.Other problems pertain to marginalizing important characters like Ruby, Walt's office manager or overemphasizing others like daughter Cady who's supposed to be living in Philly and not working in town and dating Walt's deputy who's challenging him for sheriff in the next election.  ""Longmire"" is hardly the worst thing on television but for fans of the original it's far from rewarding to watch.",3,"""Wrongmire""",1375056000,"07 29, 2013"

A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00ATLJYL6,C. Sawin,"[18, 18]","""John Dies at the End"" is based on the novel by David Wong (a pseudonym for author Jason Pargin). It's director Don Coscarelli's (""Phantasm,"" ""Bubba Ho-Tep"") first feature film in ten years. The horror comedy did make the rounds at certain film festivals in 2012, but is getting a limited theatrical run in certain markets in 2013 and is already available on demand. If you've never read Wong's novel, you don't really know what you're getting yourself into. Reception thus far has been mostly negative labeling the film as incredibly bizarre without much of a payoff, but that isn't entirely accurate. Speaking as someone who's a stickler for solid writing in cinema, this is a rare instance where a film can still be pretty enjoyable without everything making sense.Dave (Chase Williamson) is sitting in a dimly lit Chinese restaurant telling his unbelievable story to a reporter named Arnie (Paul Giamatti) and it's a doozy. After Dave is able to analyze everything about the change in Arnie's pocket without seeing it and knowing every detail of the dream Arnie had the night before without Arnie even bringing it up, Arnie is eventually able to come to the realization that this is no normal story. When Dave was still in high school, his friend John (Rob Mayes) was in a band. At a party that John's band was playing at, Dave met a Jamaican guy named Robert Marley (Tai Bennett) who not only knew everything about Dave but seemed to know every detail about everything before it happened. That is how Dave and John were introduced to a drug known as ""soy sauce,"" a black liquid which ""opens their minds to s*** they've never seen before;"" those are the words of Robert Marley. Overloaded with heightened senses, Dave and John are now able to communicate and interact with creatures that aren't from this world but have bigger problems to worry about like how to defeat a monster made of refrigerated meats or figuring out how to throw a headstrong detective (Glynn Turman) off their trail. Arnie has the story of the century on his hands as Dave's story proves to be a prime example of truth being stranger than fiction.The erratic atmosphere and disorganized sense of humor makes itself apparent right from the very first frame with Dave's story about whether an axe is still the same axe if its had its head and handle replaced while killing a skinhead. Its messy pace takes some getting used to. The beginning of Dave's story where he and John try to help a girl named Shelly (Allison Weissman) deal with an abusive boyfriend that died two months prior is bizarre. Not only because of the subject content, but also because the chemistry between actors Chase Williamson and Rob Mayes and their desire to help those who've had problems with the paranormal is eerily similar to Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Sam and Dean Winchester on ""Supernatural."" As soon as you think that though, the film seems to steer in a completely different direction as Shelly explodes into snakes, a doorknob turns into male genitalia, and that refrigerated meat manifestation appears.That's about when all of these recognizable faces start appearing; Clancy Brown as TV psychic Albert Marconi who's a lot like John Edward except Marconi actually knows what he's talking about, Angus Scrimm in a small role as a priest, and Doug Jones portraying a man from another dimension named Ryan North. You'll actually be left wanting more of Arnie (Giamatti) and Ryan North (Jones). Paul Giamatti is still able to steal the spotlight even though he's only a supporting actor here. His line delivery is just the perfect amount of over the top disbelief when Dave shows Arnie what he has in his car and Arnie's line about Atlantic City is laugh out loud funny. The film is literally overflowing with sarcasm. There's so much of it that you feel like you may have missed some of its wit in just one viewing. When you're not laughing about how ridiculous the film is its humor is sure to circle back around to make sure you laugh at least once during the film's 90 minute duration.After you settle into the film's use of controlled insanity (it's like trying to throw a saddle on a tornado before attempting to ride it), you get used to its crazy pace and begin to enjoy it. The film is particularly pretty awesome until Dave and John go to another dimension and meet Korak, then it's just bat s*** insanity. The horror comedy gets even weirder than you'd come to expect from the first hour. Nothing about the film is predictable, so there is that to fall back on. But people who don't already hate the film will really hate it by the time the last twenty or so minutes come around.""John Dies at the End"" is really freaking weird. It's along the lines of Quentin Dupieux's ""Rubber,"" but really pushes the boundaries of absurdity. With its flying moustaches, severed limbs with a mind of their own, having conversations with bratwursts, and a dog driving a truck through a house that's on fire, it's safe to say that ""John Dies at the End"" will go well over many heads and won't be appreciated and that's fine. Just remember that you don't choose the soy sauce. The soy sauce chooses you.",3,A soy sauce revelation,1361491200,"02 22, 2013"

Here, experiments in human biomechanics have unleashed the ultimate weapon... And one that Australia's top special forces agents will be unprepared to face as they enter the facility on a seek and destroy mission! CRAWLSPACE attempts to combine CUBE's suffocating mood with the psychological terror of PATRICK or THE SENDER, although it falls short in either department. Writer/Director Justin Dix relies far too heavily on a twist ending which has been blatantly broadcast from very early on. This makes for very little suspense and minimal guesswork as the audience wades through an all-too-familiar plot and predictable characters. CRAWLSPACE does come through with a few commendable moments of supreme tension as the characters face their darkest fears within the close confines of the tunnels, but these are short-lived. The added gore, claustrophobic sets, and winning make-up designs do work to the film's advantage as well, however. With a stronger character base and a greater exploration of the villain's near-limitless powers, CRAWLSPACE may have had more room to succeed, but it becomes easily trapped by its own narrow aspirations.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",2,Crawlspace,1359590400,"01 31, 2013"

Part of the issue was the fact that the animation was not completed but getting past that the story was thin and the characters were just not all that endearing.

In between are two mismatched characters who accidentally volunteer to go to a suspected rebel held planet for a reconnaissance.  There they run into a girl rebel who thinks they are also rebels (?).

It was hyped, it made the news, it has an incredible gimmick, and lots o' people wanted to see it.  Well, you gotta admit, it was a pretty ballsy venture-guerilla film making that brings to mind the grindhouse schlockmeisters of yesteryear.  Gotta give it an A for effort anyhow.But is it a good movie?  Or, like The Human Centipede, is it just hanging on a gimmick?  Well, that's kinda hard for me to say.  First off, this is a movie that obviously wasn't made with the mainstream audience in mind.  This is apparent right from the start.  Hell, the black and white photography seals that deal right away.  But add to that, that this is one of those bizarro, mind bending, Eraserhead-ish kinda movies.  That will certainly thin out the audience.I'd say steer clear of this film unless you dig movies from the other side of the fence.  If you like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and directors of that nature, you might wanna give it a shot.  I'm not comparing this movie to the films of those directors necessarily, but I'm saying that if you like those kinds of directors, you're probably a little more open minded to more oddball films like this one.  That's no guarantee you'll like it though.This movie wasn't perfect, but I will say that I enjoyed it.  It starts out strong with a scene in the It's A Small World ride that has the animatronic puppets sporting demonic faces.  Unfortunately the movie doesn't really follow through with this tone.  The wacky stuff that gets this film labelled as a horror movie(not a very accurate description) is pretty much in the final act.  The bulk of the movie has the father pursuing two teen girls through the park, as well as many scenes on the park rides(no doubt to exploit the secretly shot footage of Disney World).  It does drag a bit.  In fact, in a 90 plus minute movie, you end up only remembering maybe 30 minutes of it.  If it had sprinkled more of the craziness of that early scene throughout instead of waiting til the tail end, it would have been-maybe not a BETTER movie-but a bit more interesting anyway.  But don't get me wrong, there is definitely some crazy s%$t going on here when the movie lets loose!There's really not much more to say about it.  It's a &#34;love it or hate it&#34; kinda deal if I ever saw one.  But on my end, I did find myself enjoying it, and again, I respect it.

At this point when he makes a movie that manages to be halfway decent (The Card Player; Do You Like Hitchcock?) it actually feels like something of a triumph since most of his movies post Opera have been so dreadful.  Argento's Dracula falls very squarely in the awful camp--it may not be as awful as Mother of Tears but that movie was at least eye-popping in its sheer god-awfulness.  Dracula is lifeless and poorly acted, a boring movie by a director who no longer even seems to even be trying and whose directing talent seems to have degenerated to the level of Jess Franco.

Set in Florida, the film tells the story of a couple, Melissa and Richie (Watts and Dillon) struggling to keep their heads afloat in a depressed economy. Richie, a disabled war vet living on disability, relies too much on the bottle as he feels the frustration of not being the breadwinner, having to watch Melissa go out to work every day at the Sunlight Jr. convenience store. They live in a weekly-rental motel, Richie often has to swipe gas from other cars to be able to drive their own beater, and Melissa has her issues at work, dealing with both a lecherous boss and a violent and determined ex (Reedus) who wants her back. Things get even more complicated when Melissa finds out she's pregnant, and the couple have to figure out how to survive, better their lives with a baby on the way.Does this sound like a downer? Guess what? It is. The film plays out nearly every cliche it can grab, about drunken vets, violent exes, drug dealers, a life of poverty in the grungy state of Florida, domesticate abuse, the abuse of the foster care system - good God, you name it. Saved only by the performances of Watts, Dillon and Reedus (especially Watts, you really do grow to care about Melissa - hoping she'll escape this life!), otherwise this collection of cliches has ""mediocre"" written all over it ... and is so depressing, it could make Mary Poppins consider picking up a bottle of sleeping pills.",3,"Really two stars, but Watts/Dillon/Reedus add the third ...",1385683200,"11 29, 2013"

A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B00GBUQXSG,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 3]","Dear Hollywood: Please stop making bad movies about Mars. The Red Planet alone is not enough to carry a movie.The best example possible is ""Last Days on Mars,"" which has no plot or concept beyond ""there are zombies... ON MARS!"" I can't imagine that anyone involved put any more thought into this movie than ""zombies... ON MARS!"", because there is literally nothing else to it. It's a mediocre, unscary zombie story transplanted into a shallow copy of ""Alien.""And while it stars two actors that I adore, their good performances couldn't save this wretched pile of festering fetid celluloid -- it has no plot, no real climax, a third act that drags on forever, and characters with the depth of a shopping list.Mankind has landed on Mars, and now scientists have gone there to do... stuff. Their goals are never really explained. Then a team finds a mysterious bacterium growing on Mars, but before they can study it further, one of the astronauts falls into a sinkhole and dies. Then he comes back as a desiccated mummy, and immediately power-drills one one of his crewmates... and no, that is NOT a euphemism.Yes, the mysterious bacteria turns people -- living or dead -- into zombies, and it takes almost nothing to infect people. The astronauts frantically try to stop the zombies who (for some reason) are desperate to kill them, and must find a way off Mars before all of them are infected. And since this is trying to be ""Alien"" with zombies, they want to keep it from reaching Earth.It is honestly difficult to summarize this turd. Here's how I imagine the conception of this movie went: two inept Hollywood producers were sitting together, having a conversation.""Hey, I've got this idea. It's zombies...""""Totally overdone.""""... ON MARS.""""Genius! It technically hasn't been done before! We're greenlighting it!""That is the entire plot. No twists. No unexpected discoveries. No suspense about how they will stop the bacterium. It's just a string of zombie attacks that lead to nothing, placed in a third-rate ""Alien"" clone -- there is literally nothing to watch except the astronauts being infected and zombified one by one. It's not suspenseful, just depressing.First-time director Ruairi Robinson just doesn't have the chops (yet) to pull off a full-length movie. Most of it is shot at night, where it is impossible to see anything except darkness and clouds of red dust, and the assorted astronauts all look identical in their suits. Even worse, the ending drags on forever. The final half-hour is the longest third act I've ever seen in a movie -- just a slow, climax-free drag that finally putters out when Robinson runs out of things to do.It also has characters just deep enough to give you paper cuts. There's a halfhearted attempt to give Liev Schreiber's character a tragic past, by hinting at a disaster that has made him claustrophobic (for some reason). But the disaster is never expounded on, and it's just sort of dropped halfway through the movie. The rest of the characters can be summed up in one or two words -- Abrasive, Leader, Perky, Coward, et cetera.And honestly, the actors deserved better. Liev Schreiber gives a sort of halfhearted but serviceable performance; Romola Garai seems to be pouring her heart into a thanklessly shallow role, but she does give the movie its only moment of real pathos. There are other good actors here -- Goran Kosti&#263;, Elias Koteas -- but they're pretty much cannon fodder. Tossing out a mention of a character having kids does not make them three-dimensional.""Last Days on Mars"" is just another dumb, inept zombie movie, and setting it on the maligned Red Planet doesn't really improve matters. Only die-hard fans of Schreiber or Garai should even bother.",1,"The spiders... I mean, zombies of Mars",1389916800,"01 17, 2014"

On the whole I'm glad I bothered but it wasn't perfect.The summarizing principle is easy enough (and slightly in contradiction with the description of the movie on Amazon).  What if you could build a device that allows you to hear things that other people don't?  Further, what would happen if you could use those subliminal and unheard sounds to control people?  There now, that's a better teaser than the real description would give you.To the positive side, this is a deep movie with a fair amount to say about the morality of humanity and the corrupting influences of power.  If you could, would you use whatever means you could to manipulate people?  Once you had that power what would you do to protect it?  What if someone wanted to obtain that power for a large sum of money?  In a thoughtful crowd this movie will cause a fair bit of discussion.To the negative side, the movie has it's share of ""What...!?!?!?"" moments in which something inexplicable or patently obvious happens.  I won't go into details because I want you to enjoy those with the perfect ignorance that I did, but simply be on the lookout for them.In summary, it's worth the time to watch and worth the $0 that it costs if you have Amazon prime.  I'd say it's worth $4 or so if you have to pay for it and have a group to watch it with.  The resulting discussion with a sufficiently philosophically aware group will be repayment enough.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews.

Too often the things pulling the couple apart feel scripted and manufactured rather than organic and real. Under the slick but lackluster direction of Steve Pink, everyone just seems to be going through the motions, without any real passion or conviction.The movie also comes replete with the requisite smart-aleck, comic-relief couple (well-played by Kevin Hart and Regina Hall) to serve as a foil for the one on center-stage.

I only gave thismess 2 stars (I was being generous!) because of the fine special effects, the reasonably accurate sets and the volcano eruptions.I will probably keep the DVD only because of the effects.  I did get this from Amazon.  I also got the 1984 version of  THE LASTDAYS OF POMPEII and will review it later when I finish.  Allready it seems much better, at least in story.  So if you like excellentspecial effects and like to watch a Roman city leveled, then I would reluctantly rent or buy the movie. But you better by someclothespins for your nose.

Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama.

I kow the dvd won't be out for a good while so I'm buying it through Amazon Instant Video (which I love love love).Keifer is so passionate and the reviews promise nail-biting, heart-stopping action on every show and the first two shows more than fulfills that promise.Keifer is a pariah and thought to be a fugitive (which makes me crazy because he is a hero in anyone's book) and yet he is bound and determined to stop a hit on now-President Heller.

Sawin,"[9, 11]","&#34;Proxy&#34; makes the mistake of making very specific connections amongst its characters and in its storyline yet sprinkles the world its created within its frames of celluloid with plot holes like some sort of crater-loving Johnny Appleseed. The common thread in the film only seems to be insane behavior with little to no explanation.After Esther loses her baby, you're introduced to her lesbian lover Anika (Kristina Klebe) who is basically a complete knockoff of Lisbeth Salander from &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&#34; Anika is covered in tattoos and a complete freak in the bedroom. This is something the film points out on more than one occasion. Anika is incredibly vindictive through and through. She enjoys Esther's company because of her craziness.Meanwhile Melanie's husband Patrick (Joe Swanberg) is not a good father. He's more infatuated with trying to come off as the &#34;cool dad&#34; than anything else. The Patrick character goes through some really funky stuff in the film. Something tragic happens to him and Melanie that affects them both. Melanie begins edging back into society while Patrick kind of retreats internally and resorts to brooding. The character begins having delusions that mostly revolve around torture. The way they haphazardly leave a shotgun lying around makes you wonder why tragedy didn't strike them sooner.If you dig a little and stretch what little substance is there, &#34;Proxy&#34; attempts to say something about people dealing with the grief of losing someone close to them, how the loss affects them, and overcoming what seems like crippling depression. But the film seems to illustrate that everyone under those conditions gives in to wrath and revenge especially when it comes to the Patrick and Anika characters.But none of the characters feel genuine. None of their actions seem like logical, real-life conclusions. The film is very slow-moving and bogged down from uneventful and long strings of dialogue. While &#34;Proxy&#34; is listed as a horror, it's not scary. The scariest part is getting through the entire thing. The film's highlight is a slow-motion shotgun blast sequence in a bathroom, but even that is laughably bad thanks to how thick and jelly-like the blood appears. &#34;Proxy&#34; only seems to illustrate that stupid, insane behavior is spread by proxy and everyone suffers, including the film's audience, because of it.",1,Please pass the crazy,1398470400,"04 26, 2014"

A15C809ZYW2Z2G,B00KYZMSQ0,MsEE,"[25, 26]","This is a review of the June 24 Season 5 premier.First: for those who are unfamiliar with Covert Affairs, the show is about Annie Walker, a 27 year old army brat with a talent for foreign languages tagged by a university professor for CIA recruitment into the newly Domestic Protection Division under the Director of Clandestine Services - the black operations division within the CIA.Annie spends her first season getting her bearings.  She has a handler, a Special Forces officer blinded in the line of duty named Augie, who is also her tech manager.  Her boss, Joan, is head of the DPD and the two establish  a mother/daughter style of trust and resentment.  Joan's boss is the Director of Clandestine Services, and is also her husband - a relationship strained given that Joan is Arthur's second wife by way of an adulterous relationship with Arthur while married to his first wife.  Thus Joan knows that Arthur cannot be trusted.The first season was episode based, warm, humorous, and peppered with just a little excitement.  It centered on the developing character of Annie Walker, and why she was recruited - which includes a  relationship prior to her recruitment with a deep cover agent now gone rogue, and whom Arthur and Joan hope to bring out using Annie, who is unaware of their intent nor that her affair was with an agent.If the internet chatter can be trusted (ahem), Covert Affairs in its first season garnered a following among the Intelligence Community.  Although produced by the Jason Bourne movies team, Seasons 1 is laid back and a departure from Hollywood spy fare.  Blessed with Valerie Plame as a technical consultant, the show got many things about the CIA right, sprinkling tidbits in conversation such as the epic retirement turnover just after 9/11 that left more than half of the staff of the CIA with less than five years experience (which Annie notes is ""a bit frightening"" when told).  The security badges on the show are accurate.  Annie doesn't carry a gun (real CIA does not) and carefully observes the law.  Annie makes mistakes, loses fights, and mostly gets by on smarts, luck, and a powerful smile and sweet-and-innocent look.Annie's relationship with her sister Danielle and Danielle's family, with whom she lives, is Annie's (and the show's) anchor to the real world and her only family.  But Annie can't tell Danielle anything about her job but the cover story, which is as an art curator for the Smithsonian.Season 2 has Annie moving into more coherent cross-episode stories, an increasingly personal attraction to her blind handler Augie, and an eventual blowup with her sister as Danielle realizes that Annie is not who she says, and that Annie's work is endangering the family.  She has also been developing rather close and personal ties with a Israeli agent, and other unapproved operatives.  Slowly but surely, Annie is becoming less timid and obedient.  And while her initiative is of value to Joan and Arthur, it is also a growing problem.  Annie is also becoming more action oriented, and has to kill in the line of duty at the season finale.Season 3 moves more to a season theme thread - and follows Annie through her introduction by a female agent into the more gray areas of spying.  She's becoming tougher, and starts to carry a gun more.  She's forced to keep things from Auggie, who has been removed temporarily as her handler but whom she still leans on for guidance and support.  And she survives some major mistakes and errors.  Her sister and the family have moved away, leaving her without personal grounding.  Season 3 is a bit darker, but still retains some of the humor and charm of the first three seasons.Season 4 is one long story of increasing darkness as Annie pursues Henry Wilcox, a former Director of Clandestine Services who has always been a self-serving traitor with a megalomaniac streak running through a bedrock of Sociopathic personality.  Henry is on a personal vendetta against Joan, Arthur and all of the CIA, stealing money from the Agency to build his own spy network.  To bring him down, Annie uses her network of Agency friends to take a full dive down the rabbit hole, fake her death, and go rogue to track down Henry.  In the season finale she is  compromised to Chinese intelligence, kills Henry, and rides off into the sunset on a speed boat.  In doing so she and the team have exposed the evidence needed to return her, Augie and Joan back to their jobs, free Arthur from jail, and gain kudos for bringing down ""the worst traitor in the history of the CIA"".  The season is a good one, but for Piper Perabo fans, a little less satisfactory than earlier seasons.Oddly, the show's theme song from the first three seasons (""Can You Save Me"") which really didn't fit the fresh and sweet Annie through the first two seasons, is dropped in the fourth - just when the song had gained meaning and application to Annie's situation - who is now on a decided journey into darkness.In the Season 5 premier, Annie has been missing four months.  She returns thinner and blonde again.  And she returns with secrets, including a mysterious illness that is clearly going to handicap her work.  Yet she beats her debrief polygraph (which none of her friends accept), and is immediately assigned to track down a terrorist.  She walks into what turns out to be a stunning double feint by the terrorist that destroys an entire CIA clandestine office and its staff in Chicago, and which Annie almost prevents but for stumbling on the part of others.  Through her own heightened situational awareness she barely avoids the blast herself.The episode is engaging, but lacks the charm and freshness that drew in viewers at the start of the program.  Season 4 had a rough start, but eventually engaged this viewer.  Hopefully Season 5 will develop into a the same,If the Season 5 premier is any indication, Covert Affairs is becoming darker still.  Gone is the humor.  Gone is the early model of a fresh approach to spy shows.  Gone are the three dimensional characters.  Gone is Annie's smile, it has been replaced by a stern frown.  And gone with it is the charm that makes Annie watchable.The introduction of a rich navy SEAL billionaire is a bit too close to Eric Prince, the fun loving SEAL officer who started Blackwater on a huge inheritance and parleyed it into a billion dollar industry by buying his own helicopters and other toys, mostly for the fun of it, hiring away CIA and other Special Operations Forces, and then renting them out to the CIA and foreign governments.  About the only difference between the show's McQuad and Prince is height:  McQuad is taller.  With Arthur going to work for McQuad, we are bound to see a lot of McQuad, and that may not be a good thing - despite Annie's clear attraction.The show is moving towards a more stereotypical image of spy shows, and seems to be stealing plotline and character development from Homeland, while borrowing a mistake from Burn Notice in which the ensemble cast loved by the fans is scattered and loses the chemistry, banter, and appeal that drew in viewers.  Thankfully, Alias and Nikita have not invaded, but Annie is rarely without a gun these days.  Explosions rule the screen.  The ensemble is taking a backseat.  And Covert Affairs is the poorer for it.Can anyone save poor Annie?  She seems lost.",4,Can anyone save poor Annie?  She seems lost.,1403654400,"06 25, 2014"
