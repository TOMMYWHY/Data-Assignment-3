I could remember the time i went to the arcade with a friend, I found this game and i just HAD to play it. The graphics were weak in the arcade, but then they had it on ps1, which the graphics are much better.  I won't say this is the best game i ever played, but hey, it's not fair comparing a 90s game to a current. SO let's just put it this way because I'm bored.

Graphics: 4.5
Sounds: 4.8
Controlls: 5.0
Replay Value: 4.8
length: 3.5
Overall: 4.5

I'll recommend this to anyone who's enjoying classic games or is a street fighter fan,,, or to anyone who likes fighting games.

The single player mode is too much fun. But, the 99% of the credit goes to the multi game mode.

Don't get me wrong, and I'm not knocking some NES classics here at all by any means, but I must say, I fell in love with Doom the moment I saw it. Too bad the (...) was so hooked too that he wouldn't let me play.
So....fast forward to the release of the Playstation....and the eventual release of Doom. I bought Doom the first day it came out....and my Playstation wasn't turned off for 32 straight hours. I ABSOLUTELY love first-person shooter type games, and aside from Rise Of The Triad (the first FPS I ever played) Doom turned my world upside down.
This is, by far, the best video game on the planet....hell, in the universe.

The translation from the PC to the Playstation was flawless....hell, in my opinion, it's even better. You get all of the Doom and Doom II levels, and an additional 5 secret levels custom-made for the Playstation only. That's 59 total levels of mayhem....an immersive quest that you can NOT tear yourself away from.

Sure, by today's standards, the graphics are primitive and full of sprites and look a little blocky when you're up close....the enemies and items are modeled in 2D, meaning you can never look at their backside....and heck, you can't even jump....but....WHO CARES? This game is heaven, and even today, will still scare the (...) out of you....even if you memorized the location of every enemy in the game, knowing what to expect around every corner.
Don't believe me? Well try this situation on for size: You just cleared out a room full of Imps and Sergeant Zombies with every last round of shotgun ammo you had. You turn the next corner and hello....there's a Baron of Hell. *Change weapon to BFG9000* (...), you only have enough ammo for one shot. You aim, shoot, and barely hit the moron. He's still coming at you....and, as you cycle through your weapons....you notice only your pistol has ammo left. Oh (...). *runs*
That right there is the definition of fun....excitement....and horror....all making this game the number one video game of all time.

Using vehicles for combat and multiplied destruction couldn't be better.  Even though its graphics could be sharpened and more detailed, the gameplay, and value of this game are in the spotlight.  Each level are unique from each other, and I must say that they include a lot of beautiful textures; they range from an underground arena, to skycrapers.  Using the sophisticated weaponry with advanced techniques will keep you glued to your screen; you get to retrieve weapons you see that appear, and use them for your enemies.  As for sound, the SFX is a little over average, it isn't as detailed or spectacular.  With the music though, that's one concept of this game that makes it outstanding; orchestra, symphony type music with a touch of hard core music makes this game prosperous.
You can play 2-player deathmatches which really kick arse.  If you're alone and want to do a tournament match, you will fight and may win until you ask Calypso, the leader in the car combat series, for your ultimate wish to come true.

One thing I neglected to mention about the Pole Position titles in this volume and the first:

Croc may look cute and easy to play but It was definitely challenging even for veteran video game players.  The game is very bright with colorful backgrounds, with lots of stomping and jumping on crates and boxes.  The boss fights were very well done and exciting.  The controls took a little bit of getting used to but the gameplay overall was responsive and fun.  The game is appropriate for all ages, and the bonus levels are fun and interesting.

The game does take some strategy and you have to be very quick in several parts of the game.  It is in the same spirit of the Mario 64 game but not as polished or well refined.  The camera angles do make it hard to maneuver Croc in some parts of the game which add to the challenge.  The replay value is pretty high.  I spent a lot of time playing this game trying to get the 100 percent to make it to the true boss of the game.  It provided hours of fun as well as a lot of frustration but overall it was a very rewarding experience.  The game should be fairly cheap now, the game had a battery pack save feature which saved your progress on the memory card.  If your looking for something a little bit different than Mario this is a nice game to try out.

Overall I would rate it a solid 4 stars its not a perfect platformer, but the game was made with a lot of care, the developers did a really good job.

The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation.  If you like games with good graphics, do not get this game.
  The gameplay isn't that great, also.  The N64 version is much better, because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic, and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.
  I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics.  Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book.  I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: ""Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A."" Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story?  And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.
  I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didn't have much money at the time, so they decided to make a mediocre game.  This was bad.  Believe me.
  If you want a game with good gameplay, excellent graphics, wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it, get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.
  If you want a game with awful graphics, bad gameplay, no storyline sequences, and a Sega Genesis feel, then get this game.

The game is absolutely addictive! You can play as the Global Defense Initiative (GDI)the good guys or the bad guys, who are simply called the NOD. There are 15 GDI missions and 13 NOD missions. There are also two exclusive N64 only missions for each side. The grapihics are okay, but not anything real fancy. If you want to run the game in High Resolution mode make sure you have an expansion pack; this also makes the graphics better. Just remember to go to the opions menu and select High Resolution everytime you play because if you don't the game will run on Medium Resolution. When you use and airstrick for the GDI or use a lot of flamthrowers, flamtankes, or a Nuclear Missile for the NOD, the game play will so slow down to a crawl until the fire stopsm but after the napalm is it out the game goes back to its normal speed. When a soldier dies he spills over and a little pile of blood comes out and then it disappears along with the body. If you run over enemy troops with tank or something, you get a squishy sound. When a soldier dies you may hear a scream. These are the only violent grapcis in the game. The music is great at times, but some of the tracks are boring. This is the best strategy game for the N64! A little hint to help is that the NOD are great at whiping out infantry while the GDI are better equipped to handle tanks and defensive positions. When you are capable to produce tanks and vehicles build vehicles instead of infratry because a NOD flame tank or a NOD flamethrower can wipe out a lot of infantry with no problem at all. If you play as the NOD then build turrets and light tanks to take out the GDI forces. You can use a group of light tanks to run over infantry. Also another hint is that if you play as NOD build some recon motorcycles in the later missions when GDI uses ORCAs, they are kind of like helicopters, to harrass you and if the recon units are in guard mode they will attack the flying pests.

This game was the first game in the series to feature stunning FMV with 3D character models in pre-rendered backgrounds, which was a major step up for the RPG world, considering that any RPG released before this one either only had 3D models during battle sequences or none at all, but of course graphics are not everything. Gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game; it is the sole reason games are played, to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itself.

This game still maintains the fast-paced ATB system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles. One of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles, and very few other RPGs at the time.
This game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as ""materia"". Materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is used.

Overall, I would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike, as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral I have mentioned above.

Now, what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low ------ Sega Corporation!!!
If you haven't heard the announcement yet, Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console.  This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low.  I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn.  Once the Saturn production was stopped, only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them.
When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX (the same programming API as Windows for the PC) I was very excited, because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast.  There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come (Urban Chaos, Rainbow Six) were bad.
Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies.  I believe that Sega owes it's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform.  My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years.  My Dreamcast lasted six months.  Goodbye Sega purchases forever.",I love my Dreamcast but ....,981244800,7,,

My headphones and screen immediately presented the most humdrum, plausible beginning for a reality based game: you are going in to work. Fade in to the interior of an automated tram car. A prerecorded voice welcomes you to the Black Mesa Transit System. Such inauspicious beginnings mark the first 20 minutes of the game, and while it might sound boring, it has a devious psychological purpose.
For you are Gordon Freeman, Reseach Assistant. And the liesurely tram ride through the massive Black Mesa Research complex provides subtle clues that everything in your life is about to go horribly wrong. Sure, everything SEEMS normal; just another day at the top-secret government laboratory, right? Yeah, the gaurds grumble about their computers crashing and senior scientists berate you for being late, but its just another one of those days at the office.
Heh, heh, heh...
You actually percieve all of this through Freeman's eyes, right in the game. Like I said, you must go into work at first. You run through bright, institutionalized enviornments and chat with your coworkers as you rush to get to your work center on time.
Finally, the big experiment! All you gotta do is don your protective Hazardous Enviornment Suit, go into the armored, airlock-accessible chamber, and follow some simple instructions. What's this? A senior scientist notices an anomoly as your team bombards an alien substance, but ""it's well within acceptable parameters.""
BOOM! CRASH! SPARK! SCREAM! Oh no-- everything is exploding in showers of green energy! A massive bolt of radiation hits your coworker's observation post! The ceiling is caving in!
ZAP! Heavy breathing. Fade into a strange, almost aquatic like landscape. ZAP! More breathing. More bizarre scenes. Zap into unconciousness.
When the real world fades back in, klaxons blare. The experiment chamber is in shambles. Sparks fly. The airlock has been blown open. You must get to safety.

There are hundreds of good reviews on the Internet, and so rather than reiterating their collective points of view, I will say this to complement them:

If you have never played this game, you need to play it, if only to understand what kept millions of gamers (and probably half the population of South Korea) sleep-deprived for years.

I would go as far as to argue that Starcraft is primarily responsible for global warming - think of all the coal we burned to generate the energy required to power all those computers and CRT monitors and light bulbs (and the heat produced by them!) as a generation of gamers stayed up all night fighting invasions and plotting fiendish countermoves instead of reducing their electricity consumption by turning off their PCs and going to sleep.

For those of you who haven't played for a while, the Battle Chest is a good way to relive the memories of those happy days of bygone years. It works on Win 7, but note that the mac version of the game is not compatible with OS X Lion (Lion dropped Rosetta which allowed programs from the PowerPC days to run on Intel-based macs).

But then I don't remember many mac users in the 90s playing Starcraft. When me and my buddies were happily gaming on our PCs, they were usually doing productive, artsy things on their macs, which is probably why they now zip past me in their SL55 AMGs.",Best RTS ever?,1332547200,2,,

I didn't think much of it because it was essentially the same game design as the venerable DUNE and War Craft games.  One Age of Empires, as originally designed, was never meant to be the huge slug fest that it ultimately turned into.  The icons on the map were meant to be just that; icons representing single armies.  But the players demanded more, and a patch was released allowing multiple units to be manifested on the map.  Result, that icon that was supposed to represent an army suddenly became a single unit in the army.

So, instead of a game where you see elements of civilization compete and clash, as was the intent, new users essentially got another massive army combat game.  Not a big deal.  It was fun all the same.  I was befriended by some guys on the old MS Gaming Zone, and we'd have a blast after work or school, going late at it late at night.

To argue which of the fallout series was best is irrelevant. Its been 10 years now and both are one and the same concept. Play both, enjoy both and marvel in a world that is astonishingly engrossing. A post-nuclear environment, dark, violent, and obscene. It oozes atmosphere. The desolate landscapes, paranoid androids, and the filth and scum in between. There is remarkable insight into the societies at large. Communities that build walls to protect visa approved 'Citizens', ravaged towns filled with junkies, bums, thugs, whores and gangsters, secret brotherhoods and tribal villages, a decaying military faction, slaves, mercenaries.... the list goes on. Riddled within the world, are traces of old and new technology. The Mad Max influences are all there. Salvaged ammunition, restored handguns, modified  equipment, armor, explosives, foods, drugs, alcohol,.... whatever you can find, steal, trade, buy, or kill to survive.

And that is just what lays before you as a distraction. You can just about do anything. The main objective is a deep and character driven story which requires a plethora of other side-quests. So you can quickly see how interactive and time consuming this game will become.

The character himself is riddled with quirks, skills, gifts, and character points. Its a subdivision of the game itself, to deliver and develop a character of  sufficient capabilites that best suit your gameplay. A master thief, quick shooter, charismatic merchant, an incredible hulk, kung fu fighter,  intelligent geek, a porn star (believe it), a tactical sniper, a outdoor scout, a cocaine addicted ""tony montana""... again the list goes on. How you play the game, shapes who you are, and the quirks that are made available to you.  You even have a reputation to keep, whether it is legendary, feared or downright ""wanted"".

The gameplay is unique to this series. It is vaguely similar to the Final Fantasy series, freestyle when you are walking around, but during fights, it changes to a turn based setup. All of a sudden an interface pops up and your character's traits and skills  give rise to a subdivision of options. There are many things to consider, like action points, luck, trademark blows, health, and zoning in (body\head\limb shots)... the list goes on and on. Within this there are quirks that can help even more (e.g. there is a quick draw quirk you may obtain that can allow you to draw first blood in most fights)... you can even close shop and try to run! Also take into account the many many many different weapons available to you from knives, guns, explosives. Boost your stats with some drugs but risk getting addicted (you will have to continue to find and use). There is so much here and the interface makes it so easy to access and utilise all of it.

The graphics are obviously outdated but suprisingly I prefer it to the 3D rendering of todays RPG's. It is based on photo-realism 2d art (think Mortal Kombat 1) that used to be utilised back in the mid 90's. There is an advantage to this... it feels so much more realistic. Just take a look at some of the death animations... gruesome...
Even with all the shortcomings of this obsolete 2d technology, I think it brings more life to this post apocalyptic world.

In the thick of it all is the opportunity to meet an array of characters. Some you may allow to join you. Again you will need to manage and provide for these characters. Each with their own personality.... which brings me to my final point about this game. Something some of the RPG games even today  don't have... like Grand Theft Auto. Personality. Playing this game is like reading a book. YOu become heavily invested in the characters. There is so much tongue and cheek humour, so much history (by the time you play fallout 2). Im not talking about storyline, but the characters themselves. Current generation games seem not to go past stereotypical meet and greet characters who are more interested to give you your next objective (checkpoint). Its uncanny how right they got this game. Its unjust how wrong they were to abandon Fallout 3. Interplay went bankrupt and I believe the licence has been given to another software agency to pursue  Fallout 3. I have been waiting for the third one for 10 years now, every once in a while checking the computer games catelogues... Ive given up hope of a great sequel, specially in the hands of a totally different production team.

I have played the first four classic entries of the series, and Lament of Innocence, the Mercury Steam Lords of Shadow and Mirror of Fate, and I must say that not only was this entry released in Konami's prime, but they have given the name Castlevania a whole new meaning while adding to the overall gameplay experience. The environment of the game is astoundingly detailed with 3D background effects, including moving objects in full 3D and the creativity involved in developing the enemies make it that much easier to immerse yourself in this wonderful complete fantasy world, and escaping reality. With that being said, seeing that this game was directly influenced by Super Metroid, and perhaps some of the other Nintendo entries to the series, I must say that the Metroid-style gameplay was executed beautifully with all kinds of different suits (or cloaks) you can pick up, fluid controls, and an absolutely fantastic soundtrack that fits each and every one of its perspective environments the tracks were made for. Another excellent aspect of this game is the idea of leveling up your character to increase stats and such. That was beautifully implemented, rewarding you with easier gameplay if you destroy enough enemies and find the most powerful cloaks and weapons you can find in the game. You can also acquire various transformations that will turn your character into either a bat, a purple wolf, or simply a handful of mist, so you can pass through obstacles that were blocked before.

Now, I didn't fully appreciate the ending until I got the good one. There are 3 different ones. One is lame, one is semi okay but sad slightly, and the best one is a tremendously great and happy ending, even sad to see it end so well.

And if nothing else, it is one of the few first player shooters (including System Shock and Half-life) that I have not been able to stop playing since I got it?  So how was UT able to beat out the QUAKE III team (the pioneers  of the DM shooter)?  Let's compare!
First off, the graphics are  beautiful, and just the fact that the color scheme is more than just  buffalo chip brown makes a big difference.  All of the light variants, wall  textures, skins, explosions, and background textures make the revamed  Unreal engine look like gods paintbrush.  In my opinion, the quake engine  is dying, no matter how much they revamp it, and in this case, way too goth  and way too dark to see any of the other players.
Although each of the  games maps have some problems, UT is the clear winner here, with over 50  maps that each have their own special touches and singular beauty (although  some may look better than play better).  Quake's maps are very linear and  flat and don't have the same kind of spark that the UT maps have.
As for  AI, Quake got it all wrong here.  UT's AI is a beautiful sight, with enough  tweaks on the main menu for you to match the exact difficulty with your  skill level.  Quake...not exactly.  And furthermore, UT has an automatic  skill changer, which allows the computer to adapt to your skill level.  Awesome.  oh and...I couldn't care less about the lack of varity in the UT  skins, they still look awesome.
In addition, the AI of UT and Quake III  are what really make the First player mode a treat in UT and a painful  experince Quake III.  First of all, the first player mode in Quake isn't  worth my fingernail clipings.  It is terribly lame and also the bots AI's  are very sketchy and need a lot of teaking.  In UT, first player is great  for both newcomers for practice, and for pros who want to practice offline  before they slug it out online.  These guys act almost if not exaclty like  human players!  I love it!
Variety is no contest.  UT has not only  deathmatch, but assault, CTF, Domination, Last man standing, and a whole  slew of new weapons.  Quake has deathmatch and relativly old and barely  revamped weapons.
In addition, interface, multiplayer, hardware reqs and  overall replay value all go to UT.  This game looks good with or without a  video card and even on my 330 MHZ PII w/128 SDRAM it looked good (thanks to  my Creative Anihilator Pro video card) Everything about this game has been  made as slick as can be.  Sure, ID may be the deathmatch king, but with  games like Quake III, they better make way for GT and UT!

I still like the older MK games, but with the age of the newer mortal kombats (Deadly Alliance, Deception and Armeggedon), these games feel a little too outdated. I think this is a great game but it has a ton of glitches (and there's only one good glitch in this game). when you turn on the 1 button fatality option and when you try to finish your opponent with your 1 button fatality, it doesn't always happen. sometimes you might end up still trying to finish your person off and no matter if you hit that person or whatever, you have to wait until the match is finished. When you play this on a PS2, if you have the speed doubled and you finish a match, it freezes on you, if you have the graphics level doubled and you either finish the match or something else that you do, it might or will freeze up. If you don't have either option on and you decide to start over from the beginning (that stupid buy in screen is what I am talking about), it freezes on you. The only good glitch in this game is that when you play as Noob Saibot and you do that jump and grab move, if your opponent is to the point to uppercutting him/her off the bridge and into the Pit 1 spikes, you can actually have that person fall all the way to the ground instead of just landing on the spikes and having them stopping the opponent falling all the way to the ground. you can actually see a little bit of blue on the bottom of the screen when this happens.

because of these horrible flaws, thisis why I am giving the overall rating of 3. If this didn't happen, then yes I would recommend getting this, but because Armeggedon is coming out in a few days (which has all of the characters from the series, including Chameleon from the PSone version of MK Trilogy, Meat from MK4 and 2 new characters from the Konquest mode in that game and hopefully won't have any horrible glitches like this game does), it's probably pointless to get this. If you don't like PSone and you have a N64, get that version. If you don't have either but have a PC, try getting Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition and the PC version of MK4 (I think they released it for PC too). If you hate either PSone or N64, wait for Armeggedon. If you don't like the 2 systems and don't care for Armeggedon, get Deadly Alliance or Deception on the PS2, GC, or Xbox.

It has a really good beginning, awesome music, and graphicx that are a step up from Final Fantasy 7 (tho FF7 was a HUGE step up from the previous games). So here's what I have to say about the game:

--It is a long game. You don't need to do everything, obviously, but 60-70 hours is not an unrealistic expectation

--The story is a little confusing because there's a lot of time-travel talk about people going to the future to stop a sorceress who goes into the past, possesses another person from the characters' present, and... yeah. But it's good. Also it's a good love story if you ask me--it's right up there with the stories of FF9 and FF10.

--You don't use MP. Instead, you ""draw"" magic (and occasionally summon monsters) from enemies.

It steller graphics was the best one in the series until the release of 9 and 10. It brought The RPG gamer to a new world of playing. The junction system was the biggest downfall to the game. Certain magic raised attributes higher than others, but you could not carry every kind of magic with just one player. Having to keep a higgh supply of the magic the increase the attributes of the characters turned out to be a constant pain. The hidden drawpoints hold powerful magic spells that any gamer would need to survive. Final Fantasy 8 brought not really the best summon graphics, but the best summons to see. Seeing Odin crush enemies across the plains with his sword was nice to see. Eden summon was by far the best. The best part of the summons was the ability to boost them which with Eden will get you around 40,000 damage done to the enemy. Being able to make every characters ultimate weapon was better than having to search them. To level up quickly go To the Island of Hell with Quistis. Use her her Degenerator to vaporize the toughest of monsters. The card game was a neat mini-game to play but doing the Card Queen Quest took a lot of time.

You spend almost all your time flying and fighting with great controls, there's good AI both for enemies and your wing, graphics and sound are very good also. Additionally there's good multi-tiered story although part of it remains unresolved at the end. Some of the briefings that advance the story, introduce new weapons and review mission objectives can drag a little too long.

But as I finish the single player campaign what sticks in my mind isn't the good above but the disappointments. Most of the game takes place in a large nebula. Multi-colored 'gas' and lens flare effects fill the screen, the result feeling like playing with a large flashlight in your eyes. It doesn't improve the gameplay it just irritating. Most missions are the straight 'kill everything' type. Other missions seem designed to frustrate you. For example one mission requires you to fly a series of waypoints that are basically in a straight line. The catch is you can't see the next way point from your current one so if you waver off course you become hopelessly lost and have to start over. Finally a handful of missions are usually difficult, pitting you solo against a large number of enemies or timed with unclear objectives.

The game library is pretty large and boasts a variety of racers, shooters, and rpgs/platform rpgs. The N64 gave us that first glimpse of extremely open world game play and 3D characteristics. This was the last system to feature cartridge based games with quick load times. In an era when Playstation was marketing their franchises like Crash Bandicoot and Tomb Raider, Nintendo took a more ""fun"" approach to the N64. One of the greatest things about the N64 is that it's built very sturdy and strong. The console and games can take a pretty good beating and still keep on working. There are a good variety of games that are fun for the whole family. I think this is a great console to own for anyone who was a gamer in the 90s or anyone looking for a starter console for their kids.

If you're new to the N64 and looking for some suggestions, here's a few MUST OWN:

Basically you take command of this guy called Butz who is travelling around the world on his chocobo. The wind begins to weaken and you and some friends are given the task of protecting the crystals which basically control the world.

FF6 is probably the greatest ever RPG. Forget the dodgy graphics and sound. This game has the best storyline and characters out of any FF game. It also includes the best villain in any game ever!

Overall, DCK3 is a solid platformer game. It suffers in reviews because it lacks the originality of the first and the huge gameplay leaps of the second, but nothing about this title is remotely buggy or broken. Lots of levels and environments to traverse, and Rare included some interesting scenarios this time around that mix up the normal 'run and jump' gameplay (reversed controls, riding a rocket that needs constant refueling, dodge lightning, etc). There are memorable boss fights and an overworld filled with secrets that is explored through upgradable vehicles. There's even a family of bears scattered across the world that will help you if locate the right items for them.

Graphics are as sharp as the first two installments, and the music has a catchy, laid back tropical flavour (also seen in the brighter design of the enemies). The only nitpicks are the lack of story (Rare poked fun at this in the first two games, here they just don't try) and the character selection. It's odd that the series is called ""Donkey Kong Country"" and Donkey and Diddy are reduced to mere cameos here. Kiddy Kong brings back the heavy/light dynamic of the first game, but overall Dixie is still more useful and maneuverable.

5,True,"11 3, 2011",A3PRDWD3JMF485,B00002SVG3,Triforce Of Power,"This is a game worthy of a five-star review. Released right around the time the video game world was going 32-bit by way of Playstation and Sega Saturn, the 16-bit days were all but over. Yet, Nintendo decided to end the 16-bit era with a bang by releasing this masterpiece, which I've always viewed as Nintendo's way of saying ""Thanks"" due to the uniqueness of this game and the almagamation of Nintendo characters. Let me try to explain this one out:

First off, Nintendo allowed Squaresoft, the masterminds behind the Final Fantasy franchise, to do this game. Normally, this would be considered a bad move, but to the credit of Squaresoft, they came up with a game that not only is extremely enjoyable, but still manages to capture the feel of a Mario game with all the zany Mario quirks. Bravo. On top of that, this game shows Mario in a more animated fashion than we have seen him in previous games. His actions and reactions when interacting with other characters (which was a first at this point) is amusing and symbolic of the family friendly and lovable Mario we grew up with.

Nintendo added another interesting element to cement the legacy by allowing Bowser, Mario's traditional nemesis, to be a playable character. Bowser is personified in a comical fashion as he is continously trying to assert his dominance but always manages to come across as slightly light-hearted, as though Nintendo wanted fans of the Mario series to see that Bowser isn't a malicious beast. His interactions with Mario are pretty funny.

Also cool is running into other Nintendo characters, such as Link from the Zelda series or Samus from the Metroid games. Even Yoshi makes an appearance. I get the impression that Nintendo wanted to include these other major characters not primarily to be ""easter eggs"", but because this Nintendo game was meant to be the end of Nintendo in the 16 bit era, and it's like a farewell to an era.

And yes, SquareSoft did include a Final Fantasy character in this game, the tough boss Culex. He is actually much more difficult than the game's final boss, Smithy. Fighting Culex is a treat because of the classic Final Fantasy background you fight him on, as well as the Final Fantasy battle music and, if you win, the Final Fantasy battle victory theme. Very cool. On top of that, the terms on which you part from Culex are friendly, and he even gives you a cool item.

Finally, it should be mentioned that Luigi is not in this game (he would be snubbed again in Mario 64). However, it is interesting that when you to the area where the stars that hold people's wishes are, you can read their wishes (though their names aren't mentioned). You do find a star that says ""I hope to be a great plumber like my brother Mario"". This is actually I think the only time in a Mario game where it is mentioned that Mario is indeed a plumber.

So most people who have played this game have gotten the Lazy Shell armor and Lazy Shell weapon. However, few have bothered to get the Super suit. The Super Suit can be received in Monstro Town if you have completed 100 super jumps in a row. Doing this takes practice, patience, concentration and mastery. I myself have gotten it several times. The other item you get is the Attack Scarf. If you outfit Mario with the Super Suit armor, the Lazy Shell weapon, and the Attack Scarf, no enemy will be able to kill you. It's as simple as that. The Lazy Shell armor can then be given to Princess, making her virtually invincible as well.

In the end, this is a bittersweet note that we end the Super Nintendo era on. The game is great and incredibly fun, but was largely ignored during it's release due to the coverage of the more advanced games coming out then on the Playstation and Sega Saturn. In hindsight, this game is treasured and remembered fondly by those that did play it, and much more appreciated and loved than virtually all of the games that were released around the same time.

So there is a complaint. It's only a minor one. How awesome would it have been if Link were a playable character in the game? The game would have been very different, but it would have truly been awesome to see Mario AND Link fighting enemies together. Or even if they had made a separate game, Zelda RPG where Link and Zelda were playable characters...what could have been...","Super Nintendo's way of saying ""Thank You""",1320278400,30,,

4,False,"11 18, 2002",A22VIUJDSBJVFP,B00002SVUI,Josh,"Shivers 2, falling squarely in the family of point-and-click adventure/puzzle games, is a somewhat flawed but enjoyable, very challenging, and immersive journey. The premise of the game is that your friends, a rock band, went to a little town in the middle of nowhere to film a music video (after they earn enough money to pick up the tab, that is).. You go to visit them and find the town to be more or less deserted with the exception of a female ghost popping up now and then and some wacko running around in a stupid mask (i.e. your nemesis for this little adventure). The goal is simple: save your friends from the wacko. How do you go about that? The same as most games of its type...explore the town and solve a bunch of puzzles.
The gameplay is basically point-and-click. You look at objects. You explore areas. You solve a lot of puzzles (mostly of the extremely difficult brain teaser variety rather than the ""find this item and use it here"" type). Why anyone would lock their door with some horribly difficult puzzle that takes half an hour to solve is beyond me, but it's all part of the game. An extra bit worth noting is that the game actually allows you to watch music videos by your friends on television sets. The band, in all their infinite wisdom, decided to play detective and place clues to various puzzles in their music videos (haven't I seen this cartoon?). Not only are the music videos enjoyable to watch, but piecing together solutions to the clues with them and various other hints around town adds a bit of immersiveness to the game. Another touch of immersiveness comes from the fact that throughout the game, you yourself are playing detective. You actually search for personal info about the various people of the town and get to know them and study their interactions in an attempt to get to the bottom of the mystery and figure out the identity of the wacko in the stupid mask who may or may not be behind everything. It's not an easy task, though.. You'll likely need a notebook (and possibly a walkthrough) by your side and a significant amount of time to solve all of the puzzles and the mystery (although you can cheat and have the puzzles solve themselves at the cost of some points in your score)..
As for graphics, this game is a bit dated. It's over 5 years old, afterall. You have low resolution graphics, with the main game screen being displayed as a small box in the middle of your monitor. Still, they're sufficient enough that they don't take away much from the game. Also, the members of the band and their appearances and personalities actually fit their music and vibe perfectly (and the music videos actually look like music videos), so kudos to the development team for creating both visual and emotional character realism.
The sound is spectacular. The occasional background tunes and ambient sound are well done, and the rock music that appears in the music videos by your friends is amazing (and also included in audio CD format on the second disc!). I found myself watching the videos several times just for the music, and actually repeatedly listening to the soundtrack CD portion of the 2nd disc when not playing the game.
Now onto the major flaws of the game. The main flaw is that it's not scary at all. ""Shivers"" is quite the misnomer. While it does involve the supernatural, it's more of a mystery than a horror game. The second flaw is that the 2nd disc was somewhat buggy. It was perfectly playable until I reached one timed puzzle that repeatedly flew by in a fraction of the time it was supposed to take.

The Story:
The evil emperor is using his power to take over the realm, and to submit his evil influence in the world.
But not everybody will be bending to his will, and a group of freedom fighters escapes his malice and hords of dark riders.
Firion is the leader of the group, I have to say that his the least ineresting person in the game, Maria her brother Leon disspears after they've been captured, but only to rejoin 'em later in the game ""MUCH"" later. Guy, a strong man with a vital and private thought of ways. There's many other character's in the game, but you'll have to find out for yourself.
The Gameplay:
Fairly hard, the battle system is alot different and so is the way you gain levels, strenght, HP and MP.
Some of the bosses are also extremely hard to beat, I've spend many of hours trying to beat R.Soul for example.
There's many of random battles, but be sure not to go where you'r not supposed to, if you do so the monsters will outclass you by far. Chocobos are being introduced for the first time in the Final Fantasy series, and the chocobo melody has been used in many future Final Fantasy games.
The Music:
The best I've ever heard in any game, the world map theme is spendid, absolutely fantastic the most memorable melody of the entire Final Fantasy serie. Many of these tunes will also be used in many Final Fantasy games in the future, refering to the Chocobo theme, used in FF7. Many wonderful theme's, splendid.
The Graphics:
Fine, But the updated version for the playstation is alot better, it's been improved alot, many more colours are squared into the scene, and the battles are alot more lifelike, such as the mountains in the background with green grass fields on the side, There's also been made some fantastic FMV movies for the updated version, actually they've come to be some of the prettiest FMV that's out on todays playstation console.

I don't recall the exact circumstances on why I picked it up, but I'm willing to bet that seeing 'Squaresoft' on the jewel case had more than a little to do with it.

With The 3rd Birthday's U.S. launch fast approaching, I put the first Parasite Eve back on my list, having not played it since a short time after I bought it, and even then not having finished the game. Thanks to a YouTube user's help, I started playing the game again, from the start, and finished it one very late night a few days later.

Parasite Eve is our first experience with New York copy Aya Brea, who over the course of 6 days battles against forces unleashed upon New York, before they expand to the entire world. Overall a pretty solid story, although bits of the quasi-science are laughable. An initial play will take from 9 to 13 hours, although seasoned hands can finish the game in around 7 hours. (I completed the game in around 11 hours and 45 minutes, doing everything that I could in my first play through.) Once the game has been completed an EX game is unlocked, which allows you to replay the game, keeping some amount of your character's goods, and possibly unlock an additional ending. As noted above I actually finished the game late one night (early one morning), since I felt compelled to see the game to the end.

The game is an action RPG, involving leveling of your character and her weapons/equipment, with battle portions allowing you to move around while your action gauge fills. So, a sort of cross between Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy VII. Overall, I personally found it to be rather enjoyable, once I got into the hang of how the battles play out. The camera is stuck in place, much like the first Resident Evil games, but generally has little effect on battles. (You will have to watch for chests.)

Thankfully the game does not feature tank controls (which I can't stand), and was part of that group of PlayStation games that allowed analog controls (but at the price of being able to use the d-pad). I played the game on my 80 gig PlayStation 3, and experienced no issues, outside of one of my controllers seemingly having the analog stick stuck 'up' at times. (Swapping out another controller resolved the issue.)

It's obvious what generation the game is from because of the CG, and the normal graphics are flat, but despite that the game has held up extremely well. Of course, that may be because I found the battle system so enjoyable, and because the graphic quality fits with the darker atmosphere of the game.

The game does have a Mature rating, but what I assume gave it the rating is a character model later in the game that could be compared to Shiva's model in the Final Fantasy series. There's some talk about sexual themes as well, but nothing that a teenager doesn't know about from school. (The EX game's ending may feature content that pushed this game into the M rating.)

Overall, this is an amazing game, and I look forward to doing an EX game run very soon, and perhaps even moving on to Parasite Eve 2. 5 of 5 stars.","An amazing game, that's aged well",1295136000,,,

After WCW started to lose popularity, THQ started to do WWF-themed wrestling games. When it did, even beginning on the N64, there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap. They finally succeded (so to speak, if that was their actual intent) when they started the SmackDown! series. I have no problems with the graphics, the entrances, or the sound in this game. I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls.
First off, they gave the game arcade style feel and controls. Big mistake. They also made it more like the actual show: you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves. I may be in the minority, but constantly punching a guy gets old fast. I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat. Secondly, the game's A.I. has gotten extremely intelligent. Too intelligent. The game can kick your ass unless you're a great gamer, and I'm just average, maybe a little below. Mainly because of the counter system. The game goes like this: punch, punch, punch, punch, grapple, move-counter move-counter move, etc. You'll get countered excessively, and your counters won't work most of the time. Yes, it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV, but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion, it can't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go. I don't want to spend over an hour or more in a match, 15-30 minutes is plenty, unless it's a Royal Rumble-type match.
THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe. I honestly don't understand what the fans see in this series of game. I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work, and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering, than this is the game for you. If you want an actual FUN wrestling game, then I suggest you stick with THQ's WCW games on the N64.

I'm a big fan of ECDub. I even flew out to Philly once for it. But when I bought ECW Hardcore Revolution, I got totally ripped off. All it is was WWF Attitude with different wrestlers and a Barbed Wire match.
Nothing was really changed about it either. Same gameplay, same graphics, same everything, and total dissatisfaction. Granted yes when Acclaim lost the title to release WWF games and nearly killed the WWF franchise with it's awful new games (not including any of the older Acclaim WWF releases on SNES), why didn't they learn anything from that and not do that to EC F'n W???
Like I said it was the same game as WWF Attitude, which wasn't all that good either but it was entertaining for a while. Now granted yes that in theory, this should have been fun too but by the time this was released, we'd seen all of that and then some in WWF Attitude and there was truly no need for this game unless you loved the ECW brand.
Don't get this one. Even if it was the last thing that had anything to do with ECW you could still do without this game. If you really had your heart set on collecting anything from ECW, I would suggest getting some old ECW DVD's and VHS (if you still have VHS).

This is the new smaller design, a little bigger than a DVD case. While it may look cool, it is NOT recommended. The only pro is how cool it looks.

The CONS:

Will accept PS1 Memory cards and old PS2 Memory cards BUT will not let you use them until you reformat them. This means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there, DON'T COUNT ON IT.

The door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer. You'd think they'd have learned not to go back to this since their last design failed so frequently with this function.

The only reason you should get this Playstation is if:

A - You have never owned a Playstation before

B - You have no friends that own Playstations (so you won't have to worry about bringing games over eachothers places, or showing your pal where you are on the game via his Playstation)

C - You don't intend on playing your old games on the new system, in any way shape or form. (Except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over again).

Maybe I seem a little bitter, but my main grudge is that I just got home from playing a game I started at a friends house, put 4 hours of work into, then brought home. Then I popped the memory card in, played for another 4 hours (all the while, saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully).. when I realized that the game I was ""overwriting"" was actually the same game over and over. It never overwrote anything. So now, when I turn off my playstation, there goes 4 hours of work.

And what happens when I put in the NEW PS2 Formatted Memory card to see if I can save on that? oh HELL NO. Ofcourse not, it won't even recognize the memory card while the game is still in.

Thanks a lot Playstation. Atleast if my new XBox screws up, I can save it to the hard drive. Jerks.","Let's review THIS version of the PS2, SHALL WE?",1102982400,13,{'Edition:': ' Black'},

I heard many good things about Mega Man 2 on Nintendo Power magazines and a few of my peers, but I just didn't take the time to play it.  Unlike many 70's and 80's babies, I didn't own a huge library of Nintendo titles because they were very expensive and my dad encouraged us to rent them before we decide if we want to own them, but I should have given this a shot back in the day.

Like the original Super Mario Brothers, SMB3 became one of the biggest selling games ever.  SMB3 also brought a lot of new innovations to the Mario series, many of which can still be found today.  SMB3 regularly charts both player and critic polls as being among the best video games ever released.

Released [in at the end of 1988] October 3, 1988 in Japan, SMB3 became one the Famicon's biggest sellers.  America had to wait for over a year from when Japan got it.  Originally released in some Nintendo arcade machines before it even hit stores, the buzz soon spread about the game.  This buzz was helped by the ninety minute commercial known as THE WIZARD (some people insist that it is a movie proper, but it's little more than a Nintendo advertisement) in which the climax of the movie - er, commercial - is the unveiling of SMB3, as well as revealing the secret location to the one of the warp whistles.  America finally got its hands on the game in released February 12, 1990.

The game went on to sell approx. eighteen million copies, and when you include the reissues and rereleases with SUPER MARIO ALL STARS and SUPER MARIO ADVANCED, this figure swells to over thirty three million copies.  And what makes SMB3 such a successful, highly regarded title?  Read on.

For the second* officially released sequel to the biggest selling game of all time, Nintendo didn't pull any stops when it came to crafting this game.  Returning to the familiar environments and gameplay of the original title, rather than the radical reinvention of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, Nintendo greatly widened Mario's moves and gamestyle.  The Fire-flower and starman return.  Nintendo introduces Mario's famous raccoon suit, which enables Mario to fly briefly, and greatly opens up what is possible in level design.  New suits and powerups also include the Tanooki suit, which enables Mario to become a stone statue, a Frog suit for swimming, and Hammer Brothers suit, which enables Mario to shoot hammers.

One of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of an overall game map, where Mario would move between levels.  Nintendo also used the concept (in a much different setting with a much different effect) in ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, though in that title the overworld was much more important and you had a lot more freedom.  Here, the map served as a level grid in which to progress through the eight worlds.  SMB3 returns to the eight world format of the original game, rather than the seven world format of SMB2.

The level design itself is where SMB3 truly shines.  First off, Nintendo returned to the original game for its basic game mechanics but [induing] ensuring Mario has a whole new bag of tricks to beat the nasty Bowser and his koopa kids.  While staying true to the overall atmosphere and play of the original title, Nintendo, over the course of eight worlds, features platforming levels that ingeniously use the game's new suits and powerups to fully integrate the player into the game's world.  Each of the eight levels is themed.  The first world is grass lands.  The second world is desert (much like the second and sixth world in SMB2).  The third is the water levels.  Where the castle is on the overworld map for World 3 is roughly a map of Japan and Tokyo.  The fourth world is the land of giants.  The fifth is the Skylands.  The sixth is frozen tundra, all ice.  The seventh is Pipeland, and the eight is Bowser's world, featuring lava, tricky airships, and challenging levels.

SMB3 also introduces the seven children of King Kooper (whose the mother???), each of which rule one of the worlds and which at the end of each world you must fight in an airship.  Other innovations include minigame, new enemies (many of which would feature prominently in later titles), and the aforementioned suits.

A good portion of NES games are notorious for being extremely difficult.  Some titles are damn near impossible (BATTLE TOADS, NINJA GAIDEN III), and others are filled with cheap shots and just unforgiving, unreasonable difficulty (the original MEGA MAN).  In fact, the original sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (known everywhere but Japan as THE LOST LEVELS) went unreleased in its original format stateside or in Europe for twenty one years due to difficulty and too similar to the original game.  We only just now got the title via the Virtual Console on the Wii.

Fortunately, SMB3 has a very intuitive difficulty level.  As each world progresses, so does the difficulty of the levels, which culminates in the last world of Bowser, which does have some hard patches.  Overall, however, SMB3 has a medium range of difficulty, and while there are some tricky parts here and there, the game is not really that difficult and most players will be able to beat it given enough time.  Not giving too much away, SMB3 also jokingly refers to the original title after you beat Bowser, with the first words out of Princess Toadstool's mouth is ""Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle . . . just kidding.""  Strangely enough, they cut this joke in the SUPER MARIO ADVANCED reissue.

Overall, SMB3 stands as one of the gaming industry's most outstanding achievements, and is one of the corner stones of the Mario Series.  As much as I love SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, SMB3 really felt like the true sequel to the original game, and Mario went out with a blaze of glory on the original NES with this title.  One of the greatest games ever.

*Though this is the second sequel to be released and that the general public knew about, this was actually the fourth officially licensed sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  The first, developed by Hudson Soft with Nintendo's permission, was a game called SUPER MARIO BROTHERS SPECIAL, which appeared on the obscure NEC PC-8801 in Japan only.  This is the truly forgotten Mario game, the real lost levels if you will.  Due to technical limitations, it does not scroll and the hit dection is rather off.  Nintendo had nothing to do with its development.  The second sequel is SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, released in 1986.  This title was released only in Japan.  The game was just like SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, but much harder.  Howard Lincoln of HOWARD AND NESTOR fame (anyone who had Nintendo Power back in the 1980s knows what I am talking about) hated the title, so they took a Japanese game called Doki Doki Panic, changed some sprites, and in 1988 released the American version of SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2.","One of Nintendo's many masterpieces, essential gaming for the video game enthusiast",1323820800,3,,

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Before he had starred in his own platforming adventures, and a little after he made his first appearance in Super Mario World, Yoshi was the main character of a good amount of spin-offs (Mainly puzzlers). The game that shares Yoshi's name is one of those puzzle games, but it's actually executed pretty well, and knowing Nintendo, you would expect that.

Like Tetris, Yoshi has a single-player mode and a 2-Player versus mode. Both make for incredibly addicting experiences! You can stack up 2 of the signature Mario enemies of the same type (Goomba, Boo, Piranha Plant, and Blooper) to make them disappear, OR for a much more amusing situation, you could stack up the enemies atop the bottom half of an egg, and place the upper half on top of it all. Suddenly, BOOM, the enemies have been CRAMMED into an egg!

As for the versus mode, you know what to expect when it comes to a puzzle game containing this feature. Make as much enemy sandwiches as possible, causing the other player to be given a certain obstacle, and so on.

So, if you have a puzzle itch to scratch, Yoshi is right up your alley. You don't even need to be a fan of the Mario series to like this game!",Just making enemy sandwiches for dinner,1339459200,,,

In case you didn't know, this is a world where an old school fantasy world is coming into the Industrial Age. This is a world of mystic plate armor and revolvers, dwarves with shotguns, and elven mages summoning demons next to a train. The various quests available illuminate the problems that arise when new ways clash with old. The things you do in the game can range from questing for a magic sword that is the only weapon capable of killing a demon to arguing for the unionization of orc factory workers.
Problems? Interface is awkward. There's no keyboard button to initiate combat. Instead, you've got to click on a button on screen. Usually by the time you do that, that angry half-ogre with the mystic great sword has already closed the distance. This makes ranged weapons less than desirable, since hand to hand weapons are far more potent and it's easy to get into melee range in just one turn (two, if you're really far out).
Also, despite the openness of character development, there are some odd omissions. For example, while you have the option to create a variety of technological items, you don't seem to be able to create magical items. Those have to be found or bought. Plus, I don't see why certain races don't allow you to play as female characters. The manual tries to give explanations for why female dwarves and half-ogres aren't around, but I think that's just a cop-out.
As for an earlier review that talks about not being able to do something about the abuse of women, I think I know one of the scenarios that's being talked about, but I don't know what the complaint is. This is a game where you're pretty much allowed to slay everything that walks, so you are able to cathartically pulverize those awful pixelated characters.","Could do worse, a lot worse",1019174400,,,
5,False,"03 10, 2015",A2KP62ZRRNHMGC,B00004U1R3,Steven Bonner,"Paper Mario is an exceptionally brilliant RPG. Although it came out 14 years ago, I finally decided to play through it and I am so glad that I did. It's just so charming! It had me hooked through the whole game. I've never played anything quite like it. Some call it a spiritual successor to Super Mario RPG, and while I can understand that, the only 2 things that they truly have in common is that they are RPG's and they are set in the Mario universe.  This game is has it's own story-line and stands on it's own.

The story begins in Princess Peach's castle, as she is throwing a party for all of the Mushroom Kingdom. Bowser crashes the party and takes the Princess as well as most of the castle hostage. He fuses the Princess' castle with his castle and resides high in the sky. And thus the Story begins. Bowser has the power of the Star Rod that he stole from the 7 Star Spirits. This makes him invincible. He had his henchmen capture the Star Spirit's across the different lands and it is Mario's job to save all 7 of them.

The game is a simple turn-based RPG. You choose to attack with a jump or your hammer, use an item, or use a Star Spirit Power. As you rescue more Star Spirits, they each teach you a new Star Spirit Power. Just because the game is simple, does not mean that it is easy. It requires some dedication and strategy. As long as you have both of them, you shouldn't have many issues getting through it. I had some help from a FAQ on this very site when I was lost. Throughout the journey, Mario befriends different support characters that can be switched out at any given time, on the field or in battle. They each have their own unique traits and must be used to get around the world. For example, Kooper's shell can be used to hit switches that could not normally be reached, and Bombette can be used to blow up cracks in walls to reach new areas. These support characters do not level up as Mario does, but can be upgraded with the use of Super Blocks that you find hidden throughout the worlds.

In battle, you get Star Points for defeating enemies. For every 100 Star Points, you level up. You can then choose to upgrade your HP (Hit Points), FP (Flower Points), or BP (Badge Points.) Flower Points are the equivalent to Mana in other RPG's. They are used when performing special attacks, and must when you run out you cannot execute any special attacks until you replenish them with an item or sleeping at a Toad Inn. Badge Points are used to equip various Badges you get throughout the game. These Badges let you learn new moves or special abilities, such as being able to jump on spiked enemies without taking damage. This is where the strategy comes in, if you are having trouble with a certain boss, you can access the situation and equip different Badges to have better results in the battle.

It's so fun exploring the huge world of Paper Mario. There are many different towns full of people to talk to, and many different landscapes, ranging from a hot desert to a snowy mountain. The game has such a great vibe to it. I really enjoyed getting to know the dozens of characters I came in contact with. The game is full of charm and positivity. I especially liked exploring the Boo's Mansion! Very creepy and awesome.

The graphics are absolutely AMAZING! I was blown away playing this game on my HDTV. It still looks great to this day! The characters all look like they are hand-drawn and fully animated, like a cartoon. This game has such a wonderful art-style, and rivals games released to this day. It's simply beautiful. You'll find yourself laughing at all of the funny expressions that each character makes as you play. Words do not do these graphics justice, you must see them for yourself!

The game took me roughly 22 hours to beat. This is the first time I have sat down with an N64 game in years, but I'm so glad I did. It really makes you wonder why more RPG's weren't released on this system. This game is pretty much Nintendo's swan song of the N64, because shortly after this released, the GameCube came out. This epic system truly went out with a bang, as this game is a classic that will go down in history as one of the most charming and fun RPG's of all time. I highly encourage you to purchase this if you don't own it. The game is amazing. I found no flaws with it.",Absolute classic and charming RPG fun for all ages!

Let's get the gripes out of the way first: The armies are still too similar. Mayans did not have Two Handed Swordsmen, and it just looks silly to see them running next to eagle warriors, fighting on the same side. There are only 3 new campaigns when I expected at least 5, but there are single game campaigns that let you taste a flavor of many historical battles (such as the Battle of Hastings with William the Conqueor in 1066).
Now for the good points: Villagers. They are finally intelligent. When they are done building a mill, they harvest food. When they are finished building a lumber camp, they chop down trees. You don't have to wait for them to be done and then tell them what to do. They do it automatically.
The new technology and unit upgrades are wonderful. The thumb ring is a welcome addition (something I was wondering as to its non-inclusion in the original) and makes your archers more accurate and quicker with their bows. The Harbrinder is an upgrade for the Pike man, and a group of these guys will absolutely make mince-meat out of entire legions of calvary. I had 12 of them in a group attacking a group of 20 or so calvary units. I lost three Harbrinders and killed all the enemy units. The light calvary has another upgrade now, the Hussar. While it still is weak vs. military units, this final upgrade will wreck havoc on villagers chopping wood or monks behind the enemy lines.
Other technologies are a welcome addition and make the game outstanding. The new civilizations are beautifully balanced and integrated into the game. If you're like me, you'll love the new world empires and, despite their lack of calvary units, their ability to overwhelm an enemy with sheer weight of numbers.

It's not just hack-and-slash, either. There are personal triumphs, anguished losses, generals who you convince to join your side, warriors who show their nuances of personality in how they react to your commands.
The game is a strategic combat between the two great warlords of the early 1600s, recreating a series of battles that put an end to the fighting era and brought in over 200 years of peace.
The level of detail is great. You can see exactly how each group is put together, the loyalty of each leader, their weariness, and much more. You can choose to ignore details if you want, but a true strategist will find ways to shine by taking them all into consideration.
You can also use political influence to sway your enemies, and sometimes they'll even watch how the battle goes for a while before determining which side to take.

I've heard all about this game for years and I finally decided to play it. I'm really glad I did because Grim Fandango has one of the best story lines in all games period. Of course this game was made in the late 90's so there are some flaws but I was surprised at how few there were.

Total waste of what I paid for it in my opinion.  The sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired.  I am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting.

The one main reason for this is the difficult driving mechanics. You may say, wel thats great it jst adds to the realism, but ive never played a videogame for the reality, quite the opposite actually. The whole reason we play videogames is to escape from reality, an hour or so at a time. This game all but throws reality right in to your home away from home.
In this game's favor, i do have to say that the selection of cars is incredible, and all the detail in being able to change things on your car, more engine than cosmetic, are a very nice change from the normal 50 or so stock cars. In conclusion, there is fun to be had here, just don't think your going to look like the king of racing in the process.
If what you think your getting is a quick adrenaline rush from this game, your wrong. I found this game to be THE lenghtiest racing sim. Some races can take 2 hours to complete, thats just one race, nto a tournament, which makes tension and adrenaline difficult to find.
In conclusion, if what you want is a powerhouse game that requires MANY hours to complete absorb all the content, this is just the ticket.

Also though the mindblowing graphics for (2001), and the over all atmosphere is just out of this world, literally. The graphics engine used in the game are the same as used in the FPS game Quake, which this game belittles in every sense of the word. This game as with Doom 3 2 years back was way ahead of its time. Even today the graphics and gameplay pretty much can compete or put to shame anything on the market today when it comes to FPS's, yes even Doom 3 and Painkiller. While the game might be nearly as detailed as say Doom 3, although its not to far behind, the atmosphere is just so impressive you can feel yourself drawn into this Midevil Hell world, as is the same with Clive Barkers movies. Very Possesing. So after all this what could be bad? Well i wouldnt actually put bad per-say, its just with any game no matter how great it is there are some annoyances.

The Pros-Fascinating realistic graphics(superb), the atmosphere is one of the best i've ever played, or felt in any game. You can almost smell the air! Great gameplay, good camera(although turn off the mouse as when you get hit by creatures it will throw your angle all to hell if its left on). Good stroy line, strong dialogue, anywhere you shoot leaves something, a mark, a crack a hole etc. You don't just look in mirrors and always see yourself, you'll see ......hehe. Interaction with characters is brisk and to the point.

The Cons-Its not that the loading times between sections(levels) is to long its just there are way to many of them. Not sure how far along i am in this game but i've only encountered 3 different creatures thus far, and a few ghosts, hoping for more. Killing the howlers(the main beast) can get a bit repetative, but i'm sure as i said i'll encounter new creatures soon. Aim can be slighty off, not bad though. And lastly there needs to be more games like THIS!! or a sequel..ha.

So since none of this is what i would call ""bad"" i recommend this game to any FPS gamer or just plain gamer period.

5,False,"03 22, 2001",A3Q6KRNB6VMNGE,B000059Z7R,flaviolius,"The Sega Dreamcast has become somewhat of a shooter's haven:  GigaWing, Gunbird 2, Cannon Spike, Mars Matrix, and now Bangai-O.  The lastest masterpiece from developer Treasure (the makers of the legendary Radiant Silvergun), Bangai-O continues the grateful trend of 2D, skill-based, twitch-style shooting gameplay that harkens to the old-school days of games like Defender and Sinistar, with some new twists that could only be possible on Sega's 128-bit machine.
Bangai-O is full of bizarre, anime-style quirk.  You control the Bangai-O, a weapon-laden mech piloted by a brother and sister team, Riki and Mami of the planet Dan Star, and careen into battle against the evil, fruit-hording SF Kosmo Gang.  Yep -- fruit.  You fly around a Joust-style level, using Robotron-style controls (d-pad to move, ABXY buttons to shoot, press two at once to fire diagonally...trust me, it's easy once you get the hang of it), blowing up everything that moves or doesn't move -- enemy robots, walls, buildings -- and picking up the fruit left behind (shades of Ms. Pac-Man).  Doing so nets you points and also builds your Scatter Bomb meter, a wonderful device that enables the Bangai-O to literally fill the screen with rockets or lasers.  The amount of destruction the Scatter Bomb deals is affected by how many enemies and enemy bullets are near the Bangai-O, which can result in a screen filled to the corners with beautiful missiles and explosions.  It can also be used as a defensive device, for it wipes out enemy projectiles as well.  You can choose either Riki or Mami to pilot the Bangai-O and switch at any time.  When Riki's at the helm, the Bangai-O releases a swarm of homing missiles.  Choose Mami, and your weapon becomes reflecting lasers that rebound off any surface (nice in tight tunnels).
Bangai-O is a strictly linear game.  You progress through a timed level, fight a boss, and continue on, destruction in your wake.  However, there are over FORTY levels, and they are not easy.  This is a game that will take a while to complete.  And when you do, there is significant replay value:  Your score is not cumulative; rather, it resets at the start of each new level, and you are able to replay any level once you complete it, using the unlocked map to explore areas you might have missed.  In addition, you score bonuses for how many accumulated explosions you cause and if you manage to complete a level undamaged.  The goal to beat your own score, or your friends', is a very welcome feature.
Yes, the graphics are 2D, so gamers used to 3D will probably grimace at the pixelated visuals. The anime cutscenes are REALLY strange (Riki yells at Mami ""What kind of name is Bangai-O for a robot?!!?"", there's a sheep named Montgomery from Mongolia, a certain boss wonders if he shouldn't have become a lawyer, and whenever Bangai-O dies you're treated to an anime portrait of Riki dancing naked through a garden while an alien takes a photograph) and aren't for everyone.  The game's sheer difficulty level will be a turn-off for some, and a multiplayer mode would have been welcome (though you can trade the controller between friends in a scoring competition).  However, there's no slowdown, even when the screen is choked with 700 rockets, and the music is great. Shooter fans will adore this game for its emphasis on blowing stuff up and reflex-driven action, with strategy and even some puzzle elements entering the fray. Hats off to Conspiracy and Crave for releasing Bangai-O in the States -- it's got enough surreal charm, gameplay, and challenge to satisfy anyone looking for a fast-paced game with character and multiple explosions.",The Time of Your Life Blowing Stuff Up,985219200,12,,

This latest installment to the series is more like the older Sonic games, in that there are only action stages and no ""Adventure Fields"" as in the first Sonic Adventure. Also a new feature for a Sonic game, you can now choose whether you want to control the heroes or the villians.  This is a great idea, and it does add variety as far as the story goes, but the villians (Robotnik, Shadow, and Rouge) play very similar to the heroes (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles).  The graphics have also improved, and the game almost always runs at a smooth, steady rate.  The only faults in Sonic Adventure 2 are the horrible script/voice acting and the glitchy camera.  You can use the side triggers to circle around your character and view the area, but you can't actually change the view, and that leads to a lot of deaths due to blind jumps.  It's also very easy to build up speed in Sonic's/Shadows' stages and slip off the edge of the track. Aside from that, Sonic Adventure 2 is a rather solid game.  There are also lots of mini-games to keep you busy, such as Chao raising, Kart racing, ect.  If you own a Dreamcast, pick up Sonic Adventure 2...it's one the Dreamcast's last great games.

Because it spans such a long period, there is an amazing array of units to choose from, as well as a massive tree of upgrade options. For this reason alone, I find myself playing it over and over.
Another of the game's strengths is the unit balance system. Since, especially in the early game, every unit has a corresponding unit which is very effective in countering it, early rushes become much more difficult. It also means that most units in the game are useful (unlike many strategy games, where you can be content with building only one or two unit types).
The AI is challenging - perhaps too much so at times - though not perfect. Occasionally, if you hit a computer opponent hard enough, it will essentially give up, even if it has the resources to rebuild. Still, though, playing against the computer will probably keep you entertained for a while, and prepare you to play against other people.
The only reason I'm not giving this game a 5 star rating is that it doesn't really offer anything innovative. It takes the best elements of popular RTS games and combines them together quite well, but if you're looking for a unique experience, you won't find it here.

The game is part of a 2 part game where you will need Oracles of Season to *complete* the game (you will get a ending for beating either Oracle of Ages or Oracle of Season by itself but you will not get the best ending without having both games).  Also, unlike the pokemon series (which had Red and Blue versions which was the exact game but different pokemon included), the Oracle series are 2 completely different games.  Oracle of Ages has a lot more puzzles and requires you to think a lot more in the dungeons.  If you are not very familiar with RPG or Adventure games you will be stuck in a lot of spots (Oracle of Season is more action based and features less mind throbbing dungeons).  Overall, Oracle of Ages is a great addition to the Zelda series (though I prefer Oracle of Season simply because I played that game before this game and had a more enjoyable time playing).

I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Legend of Zelda series as it is simply too good to pass.

STORY: 5/5. Great story! Go in. Kill all who oppose you. Very simple and easy to understand.

GRAPHICS: 5/5. Incredible! Remember folks, this was the NES. When this came out, these graphics were top-notch. Sure, they made some better graphics for the NES later on, but this was when the Nintendo had very few titles to choose from. Coolest Graphics: Death and Dracula.

MUSIC: 5/5. The music is one area where this game really shines. It starts out good at the beginning with the classic ""Vampire Killer"" track. Each level has its own music and it is all good. One 8-bit tune from anywhere in this game kicks ""Harmony of Dissonance""'s butt anyday.

HERO: 5/5. Here we had a guy with a relatively normal name: Simon. I mean come on, this is a hero we could RELATE to. This was no wimp like some of the other Belmonts have turned out to be.

PLAY CONTROL: 5/5. I am so sick of all these CHUMPS complaining, ""Wahhh, wahhh, there's no midair jump control! Wahhh, wahhh, the controls are sluggish..."" To all of you GIRLIE MEN, I say to you, ""Get a life!"" You know what? Sorry people, but midair jump control does not exist in real life. Once you leave the ground, you really don't have much say in what happens next until you hit the ground. And the controls in this game are tight. They are straight to the point. Left goes left. Right goes right. B does a weapon. B+Up does a special weapon. A jumps. Up and Down go up and down stairs. What's not to love about simple controls that are economical and make sense? Nowadays you have to have a freakin' college degree to figure out what all the buttons do on the controllers we've got now.

STYLE: 5/5. The mood and style of this game are killer. Who wouldn't want to crawl around a creepy castle and whack a few bats with a whip? That's just good wholesome fun right there. And who wouldn't want to hit a giant head over and over? That's great stress relief. The mood of this game is just right. It is about as scary as games like that got back then.

GAMEPLAY: 5/5. The gameplay is absolutely great. There was nothing else like it at the time. It created a new style of play all it's own, and the games that followed and copied it such as Ninja Gaiden really shined.

CHALLENGE: 5/5. Let's be blunt here. This game is difficult. It will not be beaten on your first try. But all of you WIMPS and CRYBABIES out there who to complain about that need to take your stupid complaints somewhere else. Hey, we used to spend $40 to $50 bucks on these games, remember? If you can beat the stupid thing in 2 hours, that would have been a total waste of money. Plus, the game is not THAT hard after all. I've beaten it, and I'm not the only one. The enemies all follow a definite pattern. The question is, do you have the patience to learn the patterns and earn that sweet taste of 8-bit victory in all its glory?

FUN FACTOR: 5/5. This game rocks. This is the best game of all time. It is the best game ever created. There were no cooler games before this one, and there have been no cooler games since. And after seeing all the CRAP coming out these days, I believe that no one will ever create a cooler game. But this is more than just a game. It is a way of life. It is a gift from God to all mankind.

HOW TO BEAT IT:

The game is not that hard to beat. If you can get to the bosses, here's how to beat them:

1. GIANT BLOOD-SUCKING BAT. The first one's a pushover. Just grab the axe and whack him. Any 5-year old can beat this one.

2. BUTT-UGLY MEDUSA HEAD. Not too hard either. Just use the watch to stop her and then hit her with your whip. Or of you've got the holy water, use that.

3. DOUBLE MUMMIES - THE LOST DISCO DANCERS. By this time, you may have noticed that the game has started to become a little more difficult. Not to fear, have confidence, young Belmont! For remember, you are a POWER PLAYER, an elite member of the NINTENDO FUN CLUB. It's not hard to beat the mummies, even without a weapon. Here's what to do. There's a pork chop hidden in the room. Whatever you do, DON'T get it. You need that block to stand on. First, jump into the room. Walk to the center to activate the mummies. Then immediately walk back to the left and jump on top of the blocks where they can't hit you. Wait for the mummy underneath you to walk to your right. When they are both a relatively safe distance away, stand on top of the lowest block (the one with the pork chop), kneel, and start hitting them. If they come close, jump back, wait again, and repeat.

4. FRONK-EN-STEEN AND EAGER IGOR. If you have gotten this far, then you are doing pretty good. You've got what it takes to beat this game, my man. The best way to beat Frankenstein is to use the holy water. You've only got one chance in the game to get it. It's located on the starting level. Just get it, hold onto it, and concentrate on getting to the boss without dying. If you get there, stand on the lower right ledge and throw it over and over. It will kill him quick.

5. DEATH (DON'T FEAR THE REAPER). This is one of the hardest bosses of all time for any game. The main thing to do is learn how to get to the boss with a full meter of health. It may seem really hard but it's not. On the last screen, you face axmen and flying medusas. All you have to do is stand up straight and keep whipping. Whip nonstop. You must hit every single ax that is thrown at you. If you are in the center of the screen, the medusas will just fly right over your head. The thing to do is once you hit one or once one passes, move forward a few steps. Take it very SLOW at first. Don't try to move quickly or kill the axman. Just slowly move, bit by bit, after each head goes by. After a few minutes of this, you will be past the axmen with full health. To beat Death, you MUST have a weapon. If you can pick up the ax at the beginning and survive all the way to the end, that is a good weapon. The best weapon is the holy cross. To really use it, you've got to be lucky enough to pick up a double or triple shot. Be careful not to pick up any daggers or watches that the flying medusas drop. Once you get to Death, stand in the middle. Jump up in the air and throw the cross, then move to the left to dodge the sickles. Immediately throw another cross or use your whip to hit the sickles you dodged. Concentrate on hitting sickles before they hit you; it is your only defense. And keep that cross moving! Put the maximum possible out at once. It is your weapon that is going to kill Death.

6. THE COUNT, PART I. This guy is tough. Just 4 hits and you're dead. It will take lots of practice to beat him. Luckily, if you've made it this far, your continues will start you right at the last boss. Not that that helps that much. Dracula is difficult. You have to learn to time your jumps just right. Look for him to solidify. Wait for an instant. Then jump up and hit him in the head. If you timed it right then his bullets will pass over your head harmlessly. Concentrate on moving out of the way because he constantly wants to warp right on top of you. Try to learn to beat him without losing any health, because you are definitely going to need it for Part II. Also, don't use the cross. Get the holy water. Don't use it on him now. You will need it later.

7. THE COUNT, PART II. Is it over? Is he dead yet? Nope. At this point, you will probably feel like smashing your controller into your TV screen. Resist the urge. Just throw some holy water on him to slow him down, and rapidly jump and whip him in the face. He is hard to dodge, so you will probably take a few hits. Keep wearing him down, and you will win!!!

8. THE SECOND QUEST. If you thought the game was hard before, you ain't seen nothing yet baby!

A few years ago I found a stock of platinum ones at my local Walmart. They were all on sale for $25; I have no idea how that happened. My guess was that they had found old stock in the back.
This was around the time the Wii was still hard to find, and production of the WaveBirds had long since ceased. You can imagine my joy when I found them while glancing through Wally's World.

But I still wanted the other color just to complete my collectionist mentality, so I ordered the gray one.

Now, some time later I purchased the white GameCube controller for the Wii from Amazon. At $30 with free shipping it seemed (and was) a very good deal. Yes, they are directly imported from Japan, but there's no reason you'd need to be concerned unless for some reason you NEED the box in English. They're fine, and I believe the only way to get them was by importing anyway
The benefit of these over the regular GameCube controller? The lengthier cord.

But why choose cord when you can have a wireless WaveBird?

The construction quality is the same, but that's to be expected from anything by Nintendo. The WB is slightly heavier in that the two AA batteries in the back of the controller make it weightier. They don't come with a built-in rechargeable battery, but I prefer that as I get to use my enelooops.
Included in the packaging is a receiver which you plug into the GameCube controller port. It's a little longer than necessary, but I imagine that's to accommodate the antenna. There are wheels on the bottoms of both the controller and receiver, and these click for each number from 1-9 (at least I think the last number is 9). Just match the numbers from controller to the receiver and you're good to go.

When I purchased the gray controller used it didn't come with a receiver, but the one included with my platinum worked with it just fine so long as they matched in number.

Despite being wireless, and despite how rare the WaveBird may appear, I actually prefer the regular white GameCube controller for three main reasons: 1) comfort; 2) no input latency; 3) rumble.

1
While the WaveBird and corded controllers are identical in form and size, there is a little bit of extra plastic underneath the WaveBird to allow for the batteries and wheel. While it may not bother some, it actually hinders me from perfectly gripping the controller. My fingers don't wrap around the handles as well as the corded controller, and my unused fingers actually cramp after a while.
I'm a 5'8"" male with smaller-than-average hands, if that helps you determine my hand size.

2
I haven't come across this, but some have complained about games not receiving inputs correctly because the WB is wireless. It's true that having cords and a direct plug-in will always lead to higher input ratio than wireless, but I haven't had issues with my games not recognizing my button presses. Still, it's something to note, especially if you're playing certain games where every button press and stick maneuver is crucial, like SSB or Mario Kart.

3
Rumble.
I love it. I need my rumble.
Many consider it a gimmick. Sony tried to denounce it as an excuse for not having it when the PS3 initially came with a SIXAXIS controller. But I've loved the rumble feature ever since the first DualShock came out. If I have the option of using a controller with rumble, I'll go for it.

There's my review. If you can get a WaveBird for a decent price and you need wireless, I'd say go for it. But you can get the much superior--in my opinion--white GameCube controller with extra cord length, brand new, for a less princely sum.
And now that Nintendo announced they'll be reviving the GCN controller for SSB Wii U, those could be another better alternative.","A great controller, but not my preferential GCN controller.",1402617600,2,{'Color:': ' Grey'},

2,True,"08 12, 2004",A237ZAVKIOJFWX,B00005BZCH,blakletter,"This game suffers from an unusual problem that most sequels don't: it seems the developers listened to the gaming community.  The first Spider-Man The Movie game was a lot of fun, but it had it's limitations- it was too linear, there was no room for exploration, and your activities were limited to the skies and rooftops and a few indoor areas.  Spidey-fans and gamers alike wanted more room to swing and more opportunities to use their great powers with great responsibility- but less linearity.

S-M2 bucks that trend.  In a nod to Grand Theft Auto 3-style gaming, the city is now yours to explore.  There are huge skyscrapers, dark alleyways, and bustling streets.  You can either choose to follow along with the linear plot, seek out mini-missions that net you points you can use to purchase upgrades, or hunt down hidden items (for no apparent reason than a higher overall score).

While great in concept, the implementation is sorely lacking.  There are only a handful of randomly-generated mini-mission types (car chases, robberies, air-land-and-sea rescues), which forces you to replay the same tired action sequences over and over and over.  Fun for a bit, but not for hours and hours of filler.  The way the game is structured, you have to purchase upgrades to progress- so you are forced to take hundreds of these mini-missions to follow the game's main plot.

Swinging around the city is lots of fun, and you get a bunch of different upgrades (web zip line and slingshot for example) that aren't really functionally necessary, but still add to your enjoyment.  In addition, you can pull off weird midair Tony Hawk-like stunts (also purchasable)for no apparent reason other than that they are marginally enjoyable as well.

The main plot is well done.  It diverges from the movie and adds in some nifty comic book characters such as Rhino and the Black Cat, but the generally outline- defeat Octavius and win back Mary Jane, remains the same.

The fighting system has apparent depth, but most combat against non-bosses can be resolved with button mashing.  It can be fun at times, tossing bad guys left and right- but after awhile pounding thugs into the pavement or hanging them off lampposts looses all semblance of a challenge.  S-M2 is also the 700,000 game to feature a Matrix ""bullettime"" mode.  Yawn.

So much could have been done with this game that I can't help but suspect that we were given an unfinished product set to be released concurrently with the movie.  It is truly a shame.

There will be 16 civilizations, and you can play with them all at once on totally customizable maps. Each civ has it's own special unit and specific traits, however these can  be turned off. The Romans special unit is the Legionnaire, the Aztecs the Jaguar Warrior, the Persians the Immortal, etc. Graphics have also been greatly updated. With military, you can have stack units, and form armies. There's also a chance that elite units might turn into great leaders, such as Caesar, Hannibal, etc that can rush build wonders or form armies. You can also make your own units, maps, civs, and governments and add them all in as you wish. The game will ship with 12 scenarios too. However, it will probably not come with multiplayer, but a patch with MP will be released eventually.
Diplomacy is different now. There are alliances, trade embargoes, rights of passage, mutual protection acts, and even the UN. There is also the diplomatic bargaining table, where you can make as many deals as you want. You can offer ivory and gold for the city of Pompeii, or offer the Gunpowder technology for their maps, or pay reperations for war. Anything is interchangeable.
 Trade is not done with caravans anymore, but with trade routes that can even be pirated. Resources also come into play. For example, the tank requires oil, iron, and rubber. The Legion needs iron, etc. There are also luxury resources such as ivory, gems, wine, etc.
There are also new units, such as the Privateer. Like I said, there are also 16 unique units. Enemy cities can also be destroyed in war time and their workers can be made POWs.
Workers are a new concept. They do land upgrades and build colonies, while city building is left to settlers. There are also 6 paths to victory, as compared to Civ2's 2 paths. Culture is also a new innovation. Culture points effect your influence on neighboring Civs and are generated by art or religious buildings like temples, colosseums, libraries, etc. With enough culture you can even assimilate neighboring cities. Citizens also have their own nationalities.
There are also Golden Ages, which can either  be triggered by wonders or by military gains, and you get bonus production for 20 consecutive turns.

I really enjoyed several of the worlds presented here, and some of the contraptions are simply stunning; however, some of the puzzles are very frustrating. Many of them initially difficult, but once attacked from the right angle, they become clear. There are others, though, that I just couldn't figure out without the assistance of a walkthrough. Perhaps I'm a complete moron, but they just weren't intuitive to me.
The animation is very pretty, and the cutscenes of good quality. I wouldn't say the graphics approach Myst Exile, but they're close to Riven. This game does suffer from the usual Dreamcatcher navigational shortcomings, though - one is not allowed free movement; rather, there are only certain areas to click on, and then the game ""walks"" you to them automatically. I prefer being able to freely navigate the environments, but this does result in a lot more overhead on the game. Further, there was one area of the game that was nigh-impossible to navigate at all - it was intentionally disorienting, but I feel they went overboard and made it too frustrating. This is a pity, because this world (an underwater one that largely resembles a giant jellyfish) is very lovely.
As I mentioned previously, the plot had some interesting ideas that just didn't get fleshed out too well; the overall storyline could have been made much more interesting and exciting, and the characters could have been better developed. Still, despite its shortcomings, it's an enjoyable game that really doesn't take too long to play at all; even with the difficulties I had with a few of the puzzles, I'd imagine it took me less than 12 hours to play, start to finish.","Beautiful, but not hugely satisfying",1019174400,12,,

I found the campaigns to be dull and derivative, the computer AI to always be too easy or too hard, and all of the civilizations bled together.
Admittedly, to some extent, SWGB suffers from these same problems. The single player missions are rather derivative, and more to the point, they don't have a whole lot of the movie's scenes. Again, the AI can be too hard or easy. However, the races are all quite distinct. Sure, the majority of units share a commonality among all races, but they look entirely different, enough so as to convince me these really are different factions. In fact, it makes it easy to play any race and know what you're doing, but the battles still have to clear sides fighting.
This game is much more fun multiplayer, where there're several fun ways to play. The computer AI still seems pretty inconsistent, but it's definitely on par with other strategy games.

Final Fantasy Chronicles features two games: Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger.  When it was released on the SNES, Final Fantasy IV was known as Final Fantasy II (it was the 4th game over all, but only the second released in the United States).  In America, FFIV was the first of the series to have distinguishable characters with personality as well as having a real storyline to follow.  Chrono Trigger is arguably the best RPG ever, and is without question one of the best on the SNES.  In my mind, Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy VI are pretty much tied for my favorite RPG of all time.  This is the first time either game has been available on the Playstation.
Final Fantasy IV:
This has long been a favorite of mine.  It had a story that is still one of my favorites with characters that I feel are more memorable that most of the Playstation era Final Fantasies.  This is the Final Fantasy that I grew up with.  Spells are learned as you increase in levels, characters move in and out of your party as the story progresses.  The game has one of the great villains in Golbez.  Kain and Rydia are still two of my favorite characters.  While the game is easy, it is has been made more difficult in this PSX port.  You play as Cecil, a Dark Knight as he rebels against the King of Baron in a quest to save the Crystals of the world from Golbez.  This has a large cast of characters who will fight with you (and against you) and is simply a fun game to play.  Yes, the graphics are early SNES era, but this is an old game.  It remains a fun game.
Chrono Trigger:
As I said above, I view this as one of the all time great games.  The story, involving time travel and its effects, is one of the best and is fairly complex with each action changing the history of the world but then opening up new questions and conflict.  Chrono Trigger featured 16 different endings (more than 10 for sure) depending on when you decide to beat the game.  After completing the game once you can restart with ""New Game +) and begin the game with all the experience levels and stats that you had when you completed the game.  You also begin with most of the weapons and armor (the only things you lose are those weapons that are important to the story, like the Masamune).  Chrono Trigger has a distinct and memorable cast of characters and this is a game begging to be played.  As with all of the PSX ports, the game is more enjoyable if played on the original system so that you don't have to deal with loading times, but the game is also much more expensive to buy for the SNES.

Anyway, I have to say that my wait is over and this game is magnificent.  Filled with rich detail and such a twisted storyline that you can't put it down.  You need to find out what happens next, as if this is the PS2 version of a soap opera.
The controls are eary to use, and the character and environment detail is top nothc.  The voice acting is simply fantastic, which is the real strength of this game.  The enemies are also a bit smarter, which adds to the realism.  The cut scenes are great, but that's where i have my only gripe.  You can't play through this game more than once without getting bored with all the excessive dialog (okay already, we know what happens.  Let me shoot someone before I go insane!).  And personally, I think Snake should have had a larger role as a playable character.  It is also a shame that this game is so short.  The original Metal Gear Solid on PSX was at least twice the length.  I finished this game in about 2 days.  Such a shame.

I picked this game up at a (local store) because they were selling it reasonable and never expected to actually enjoy it. Coming straight from recent hits, Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and the new GC version of Resident Evil, I was sure that this wasn't for me. Besides, Soul Reaver 2 left me bewildered even after the first left me amazed. So, here comes this Shadow Man: 2econd Coming game, never heard of the first one (I was never a N64 fan,) and I popped it in. As I said, coming off the previous hits, I found the controls to be difficult and strange at first, then, I found them quite appealing and different. As a game, it stands up great, lots of puzzles, creepy atmosphere, and a Gothic soundtrack. The graphics fall short, simply, because of the ""recent hits"" again, but gameplay isn't lacking. Finding the bird skulls is tedious, though swimming through the swamp with lifelike alligators chasing you is unnerving. Better to use the Asassin Rifle first and clear them out. People may complain that it's too tedious and boring, all I can say is this: If you want to play and not think, pull out the old ""Blood"" & ""Doom"" series, or at worst, stun yourself `with the graphics of ""Soul Reaver 2"" without a semblence of game.

3,False,"06 20, 2003",APZC5PRJVM0PY,B00005N7YR,JD,"I would really love to have someone release a WWII shooter that actually felt like WWII.  And while EA likes to boast the realism, frankly that only goes as far as the weapons, the launguages and the location.  The game is 100% linear and 99% predictable, and after finishing it, I feel more like I have finished reading a book, not playing a game.  Honestly, the mistakes are so glaring that EA really could have made a better game if they would have tried harder.  This is definatly one you will need to try for yourself, and reach your own conclusions on.
The GOOD:
- Missions remain interesting throughout the game.
- Some wonderfully scripted encounters, and occasionally you will get to see wonderful character actions in your allies as well as your enemies.
- Nice range of American and German weapons, and fairly accurate noises.  Tanks are fairly life-like as are aircraft.
- Lots of speaking (English and German).  Scripts are correct for the locations, and you don't run into situations where dead soldiers are carrying on conversations and such, as you do in some other titles.
- Accurate uniforms (within reason).
- Sniper rifles are accurate, powerful and fun (and there are plenty of opportunities to use them, if that is your thing).
The BAD:
- The graphics are not as good as, for example, Return to Castle Wolfenstein on the Xbox (I'm using a Nvidia GeForce4 64mb DDR video card), or as nice as Delta Force Blackhawk down (which is a better game).
- When shot, your character's aim flies across the screen.  This may enhance the realism, but when you are confronted with multiple enemies it makes it virtually impossible to hit anyone and soon becomes incredibly annoying.
- Enemies have certain locations from which they spawn, in fact you can find them and stand there and gun them down as they suddenly materialize.  Also, some enemies (like snipers) have not materialized until you step past a certain point (into their line of fire) and then they spawn and fire.
- Cannot interact with surroundings (doors, windows, etc.)
- Lack of blood (to maintain the Teen rating).
- Very linear.
The UGLY:
- MG42/44 is lethal in the hands of the enemy, but when you have the opportunity to man one the bullets fly everywhere but where you are aiming, in fact, the machine gun is only slightly more effective than any of your standard arms, and much more frustrating to try and use.
- Allied AI is NIL, and considering some of these guys are supposed to be Rangers...they just run into the open and fire then stop, then fire and stop again while they are being gunned down.  I was happy to see them get slaughtered so at least I could move (oh yah, you are stuck behind any obstacle as if it were twice as wide as it really is).
- Enemies continue to rush you with no regard to their own casualties, and will even run from around a corner straight into your fire, requiring no effort from you to gun down entire squads.
- Shrubbery and leaves will block your bullets, but not the bullets of the enemies, making Snipers almost impossible to kill unless you rush their positions.
- Snipers are way too good (even when I knew exactly where they were they could see me before I could see them).
- The signifigant lack of an ending of any sort is unforgiveable.  What did they do, just give up halfway through???","One man's ""greatest game in the world"" is another's letdown",1056067200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Be forewarned this game deserves its Mature (M) rating not for language, but for pure violence.  As the main character Dante you will go though an island filled with demons, ghouls and monsters.  Dante is the half demon son of the Dark Knight Sparta who, after his mother and brother were murdered, vows to hunt down and destroy all demons and devils.
The weapons you start with are a sword and two semi-automatic pistols.  The pistols like every weapon you will receive have unlimited ammo.  Which is great because the enemies are relentless and the bosses cut no slack.  The fun is in the challenge, if experiment while fighting Dante will discover more about the abilities and weaknesses.  These observations are recorded in your helpful menu system.  Aside from the guns you pick up a lighting sword and fire gauntlets.  Either weapon allows you to use the Devil trigger, which gives you blows increased strength and allows you regenerate a small portion of you health.  The game uses Red Orbs from dead enemies as money.  They're bonuses for combos and flair.  In short, you get more money if the kill looks good.  These orbs can get you item and (more essentially) better skills.
This godsend of a game has great story.  Even the game's voice acting is good, if only a little cheesy.  The music really helps Devil May Cry present itself as a hardcore action game. It keeps slow when there is little to do but search for a fight, and picks-up when there is battle.  You can't ask for much more.

5,False,"01 4, 2011",A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B00005NCCI,Antoinette Johnson,"This is the second Crash game I've ever owned and my second favorite in the series after Warped! I absolutely love this game and how it stays true to the old classic Crash Bandicoot games.

 As explained in my Warped review Crash Bandicoot is a platformer game series dating back to the PS1 days (definately a 90's mascot). Its also got a place in my heart as one of the first PS1 games I ever played as well as one of the hardest game franchises I ever played. I think it might have been one of the first games to come out on the PS1 period. The first game involved you playing a mutated Bandicoot that escaped the lab of the evil genious Dr. Neo Cortex. Saddly his girlfriend Tawnya wasn't so lucky so you have to travel through many hard as hell levels to rescue her. I never actually finished the first game, because theres one castle level near the end I just got stuck on (them damn bats!!XD). I want to play it again some day though and finally beat that level! One thing I remember fondly is the game had great level designs and actually looked pretty good for its time. It was fun, challenging, funny, and it never got old.

 In Wrath of Cortex Uka Uka, the evil brother of the witch doctor mask Aku Aku, releases five elemental mask that set out to destroy the world with the help of Cortex's new super weapon Crunch Bandicoot who is powered by the mask during boss battles. Crash has to find crystals and put the elementals as well as Crunch in thier place.

 All Crash games up to Warped were developed by Naughty Dog, the first to be exact. Wrath of Cortex has the same publishers, but is developed by Travellers Tales (pretty decent games) who I think did a really good job in making this game. It really catches the fun of the early games. For one the gameplay is spot on! Everything works the way thier supposed to. A matter of fact, I can't recall ever having problems with control in Crash games. When jumping you always have to build up momentum, expecially when platforms are far away, plus you sometimes had to calculate how far something is to survive jumps which added to the challenge expecially on side-scrolling levels. The music is wonderful! Its not my favorite video game soundtrack but its decent and nice to listen to.

 When it comes to choosing levels Wrath of Cortex can be compared to Warped in this regard. You go through 5 levels than face a boss. Every level is unique and in some you actually play as Crashes sister Cocoa. I don't mean riding that tiger, you actually platform as her. I found these levels very fun, but its much easier to get hit by enemies and die as her. Luckily these levels are very few. Theres also flying levels which I confess I don't really like that much. Im happy they didn't put many racing levels in this one like WarpedXD The race levels are a big improovement over the ones in Warped. Out of all the games I think this one has the most unique Boss battles. While in the other games you often took on the boss head on by avoiding attacks than getting close to attack, in this one you actually have to avoid touching most bosses period. For instance in one boss battle you have to run from the boss and jump in a suit that you use to spray water on him, while avoiding deadly lava rocks that he throws at you. You definately need Aku Aku for this battleXD The secret Gems, crystals, and Relics from Warped are also back as well. Collect all the relics and you unlock the secret levels. Harder than it sounds for those who never played Crash at all.

 I have to admit though. None of the Crash games I've played so far can match the difficulty of the first game. I can't say anything about the second game (never owned it), but I can say that what makes Wrath of Cortex as well as Warped easier is how convenient extra lives are. Trust me. I can guarantee you that by world 2 you'll have almost over 50 lives. That doesn't keep the game from being hair pulling later on though. I was kind of disappointed with the death animations in this one. In Warped the death animations when hit by different obstacles and traps range from ""wtf"" to just plain hillarious. In this one thier pretty much ""meh"". That doesn't stop the game from having funny moments though, like how our enemies will talk to us in the level select area and before load screens. Speaking of Load screens this one has the longest I've ever experienced in the series. Still its nothing compared to loading screens I've faced in games outside the series (coughEnter TheDragonFlycough).

 Crash Wrath of Cortex is a must have for fans of the series and of platformers. I know reviewers were mixed on this game due to how similar it is to its predesescors, but that doesn't stop WOC from being what the first 3 games are famous for. Just being plain old fashioned fun and entertaining, like video games are supposed to be. Don't hesitate to buy this.",So much fun!,1294099200,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

I usually never give a 5 star rating but this game comes very close.  This game replicates the best simulation of the game of basketball in ANY level : highschool/college/pro ... even amatuer.  I will list the good and bad points of the game below, and help compare the game with others out on the market :
Good Points :
Gameplay :
1. The game defense AI is incredible.  The cpu actually plays the passing lanes on defense.  There are no cheap passes in the game.  Even inbounding the ball is a challange at times.
2. Gameplay flow is true to life.  For instance, if you have a hot player shooting lights out, go to him, he'll hit most of his shots, just like in real life.  Vice Versa, if the cpu has a hot player, the cpu will also go to him, good AI move by sega.
In addition, the flow of the game reflects team runs more than any other.  If the cpu is scoring on a streat, you MUST call a timeout or find a way to stop them or you will be blown out.  And the same goes with your team as well!
3. Zone Defenses!  Has a variety of zone defesnes that you can choose from that the other products out don't.  This helps alot when you go up against perimieter shooting teams.
4. Challanging AI where you cannot really beat this game after a week.  Whenever I play, and I have 3-4 wins in a row and think I've figured the game out, the CPU makes adjustments and beats me!  Winning one game is a great satisfaction since the game is very difficult.
5. Player ratings count in this game, same as skill sets, just like the real nba.
6. Options are good :Franchise mode is adequte, and NBA STREET COURT mode is fun to play.
Cons :
1. Goaltending bugs :  there sometimes are goaltending calls when the ball is clearly below the rim.
2. FreeThrows : Free throws are too easy in this game with the analog sticks.  The problem is that you can make free throws regardless of who's shooting.  They seem to have forgotten to implement the different player ratings in the free throw code(whereas last years NBA2K1 did).  So you can  be Shaq who should be terrible in the free throw department but isn't once you figure out how to make free throws.
Compared to the other games on the market, this is the best this year (I have only played the PS2 version). Nbalive2002 doesn't come close is simulating a real nba game as NBA2K2 does.  Nbalive2002 is more a simulation/arcade which would probably be better suited for younger kids.  NBA2K2 has a large learning curve when trying to be successful at the game.",Incredible Simulation of the sport of Basketball,1012953600,12,,

Not only do you have to keep your customers happy and coming back, but you have to maintain your animals' health and happiness. To keep your animal happy you have to have a suitable environment for them. Keep the environment the same as their homeland. Not sure where the animal resides? You can read info on them. This game can be used as a learning tool! To keep your animals healthy, make sure you have plenty of zoo keepers and rush them over when your animals are sick.
There are so many elements to consider when running your zoo. The most important is location, location, location. This will determine how profitable your food joints or gift shops will be. Don't forget to put in restrooms or garbage cans. Also make sure you hire grounds people to maintain your zoo, animal cages and the fences themselves. You don't want your animals getting out. (Even though it is funny watching)
There are two modes of play, free form and scenarios. There are tutorials as well. The intermediate and advanced scenarios are locked until you complete the beginner ones. The game also locks animals and objects and notifies you in the game when more objects have become available. Some animals, toys, plants and environments are locked until you complete research on them. If you still can't find the animal you're looking for chances are they'll have it for download. You can get animal, object and scenario updates from the internet. This should help keep the game interesting since there is no multiplayer.
This game has many Easter eggs and other funny moments. For example if you put a lion, tiger and a bear in the same cage your paths will turn yellow. (yellow brick road) If you notice my screen shot has a Microsoft plane flying across the zoo. This game also has holiday effects. My visitors are wearing orange and black for Halloween. I was also able to add a Jack-O-Lantern for decoration. Witches were flying around too. The funniest moment in the game so far had to be when I was building a cage for a cheetah, I didn't notice a kid got in the cage until I added the cheetahs. The boy was running around screaming and eventually got out. I thought that was funny. Even funnier was the fact that, that particular incident did not affect my angry visitor rating.
From a Christian standpoint, this game is pretty clean.  There are Easter eggs for the holidays like witches and Santa Claus though.
The game was easy to install. The graphics were good. Nice detailed scenery. Good music and sound effects. The game ran very stable, no crashes. It will run on all Windows platforms. (It is published by Microsoft) The animal AI is pretty good and natural. You can watch them play and react to their surroundings.

I immediately invisioned myself leading a big, maybe even huge, team of soldiers. Instead I got a game pretty much like the old, and originally fun but now boring, Rainbow Six games. It's exactly like Rainbow six escept outdoors and with less soldiers and less choice of equipment. You have three teams. Alpha team can have 3 soldiers on it, Bravo 2, and Charlie only 1. Making it very like the Rainbow Six games except worse. The good points are the good graphics of the soldiers however. Thier guns are very well put together graphicaly, and the suits for the snipers have nice camoflauge aspects to them. The scenery is rather nice too, very realistic are the trees and bushes and sound effects and such. However, putting on night vision turns the scenery a bit too game-like. It falls short in terms of weapon realism too. There is no kick (Recoil) for any of the  weapons, making it very much like a poorly designed FPS game. The scenarios are nicely designed. with realistic objectives and good maps. However with the small team you have these maps are more of a curse then a blessing. Multiplayer on these maps is much, MUCH, more fun. Another thing I wish they'd implemented was the ability to play as a regular soldier. Not having to command anyone or anything, just to follow along with the mission plan. Having to monitor everyone and move them along with you took a big fun factor out of the game. The Firefight single mission types and such did keep the game going for me when I got bored of the regular campaign though.
Upside:
Good scenery, player models, and gun graphics. Several different single player game types. Good mulitplayer action.
Downside:
Not too realistic, no recoil with weapons etc.

It was pretty fun, and although I never bought it, it was worth a rental or two. When I saw that Wave Race: Blue Storm was included with my GameCube bundle, I thought it might be more of the same. Unfortunately, I was right - it was pretty fun, but probably only worth a rental or two.
The gameplay isn't much different from Wave Race 64, with one major exception. The racing concept is the same as before. You race other contestants on tracks, finishing high enough unlocks other tracks, and so on, although it's expanded in this game. One nice touch is that when you are racing in championship mode, you get to choose the order in which you race on the first few tracks, and weather plays a factor - waves can be higher and visibility poorer during rainy weather than during a sunny day, so you have to decide whether to race on the easy track during the rain, to balance things out, or gamble that you won't need a top-three finish on the last track and wait till the end.
In addition to the championship and time-trial modes, there's also a stunt mode, similar to the SSX series, where you do tricks to earn points. The problem is that SSX does it much better, although in Blue Storm's defense, snow lends itself to tricks more readily than water does. Blue Storm doesn't have trick books, costumes to unlock, or anything like that - you just go around the course doing tricks to get a high score, so there's no real incentive to play over and over again.
Ultimately, that was my verdict on the game. It was fun to play for a bit, but without a compelling reason to replay the courses, once you've unlocked a series, there's not much of a reason to go back and play again. This may be more fun for multi-player competition, but I'm looking for games that are fun for one player as well, and Wave Race: Blue Storm just couldn't provide the replayability that SSX Tricky does.","Nothing spectacular - a nice diversion, but no more",1013817600,,,

1.  The game isn't much of an RPG- who cares... you get to run around and kill people.  The action cuts right to the chase, and there are always enemies coming at you.  I don't see how that can get boring.
2. The game is repetetive, hack and slash... Not entirely true.  The enemies change, and battles get harder or more intense.  And the enemies come at you differently, with several traps waiting around the corner.  I don't see how that's repetetive.
3. No time to build your character... this is true to a certain extent.  However, if you play the game again, you get to keep your character and build onto experience points they already have.  And trust me... those spells and powers look mighty grand at level 70.  Some of those enemies won't have time to chase you around anymore.  That's something to look forward to.  Besides, why buy a game if you can't play it several times?

Perhaps its simplicity is the key. That, and the delightful narrator who sounds suspiciously like Sean Connery. The premise is that you get an area map of the kingdom with all kinds of quests or challenges that you must complete -- from wiping out the monsters, to reclaiming your crown, seeking the holy chalice, to rescuing your son who's been kidnapped by evil elves. The beginner levels will get you into the game and understand how it works; it's fairly intuitive and a fast learn. The advanced levels offer some challenge; some more difficult than others, and will test your ability to logically figure out solutions. I've yet to get to the expert levels.
While there is fighting in this game, once you build your ""army"" (consisting of necromancers, wizards, warriors, rogues and explorers), they automatically fight any enemy that enters your domain. They will also go off and fight enemies at greater distances. You can set reward flags up to have your army target and destroy one enemy camp over another.
Another great aspect of this game is that you get to build up your little kingdom. You place your wizards' guild, your rogues' guild, your warriors' guild and then magically houses begin to sprout up and pad out your town. You also upgrade your levels with gold, research new attack methods with a library or through the guilds, and create marketplaces and blacksmith's shops. Upgrading will get you new types of buildings (like temples) and you can watch your castle grow along with your kingdom.
You get, in this package, not only the original game, but the second release add on of the game for further adventures and quests.
It's a fun, addictive game. The quests can be short or long, not requiring a high demand on time that some games do, and is fairly straight-forward to play. I could see both children and adults enjoying this game (there's no vulgarity, but there are some jokes and humor with dialogue).

Don't get me wrong good game but, PsOne type graphics!!! How the Xbox can produce graphics this bad, just amazes me when I see games like Halo 2 or The Cronicles of Riddick!!! I can't believe I bought this for $50 when it first came out.... good grief!!!

 Hey, now their selling it for only $19.99 since it was a Platinum Hit, if a game is at that status it's usually a good sign!!! Well, Knights of the Old Republic is the same price though,.... really if you had a choice between the two which one would you pick!!! This isn't the best game out their and is now forgotten by many, but is a good piece of hidden treasure!!!

 Well, their may be some bad graphics and some chessy voice overs, but it is still a solid game filled with some fun gameplay!!! It may not look like much when you first see it but, once you start playing through the game it kind of get addictied!!! The game is a little too easy, and could have been worked out better!!! Gosh I thought the battle with Darth Maul on the last level was going to actually be hard and well it ends up being the easiest one to me!!! It didn't take much time to beat it, I say just rent it, beat it and move on!!! Well, the only multiplayer thing is the arena!!! Which was kind of neat but, after about 3 times of playing that I was bored!!!

 Anyways, I liked the variety of puzzles, hack n' slash action, along with some sweet force powers!!! You go from fighting gangs, to miner, to sand people, to droids, ..... you see their is alot of depth and detail in level design!!! If this was released on the PsOne this would have been awesome!!! As you look at other games, you see their really isn't much that boosts the gameplay up, it's nothing special!!! It is fun though, I'll give it that, but this isn't an Xbox quality game!!!

 If you can get this game cheap, be free to buy it, but this is not worth $50, not by a long shot!!! So if you've tried out every other Star Wars game and are looking for something different you should probably rent it!!! This game is for hardcore Star Wars or hack n' slash laid back adventure fans!!!

 Overall, I will give this a 3/5...... not the best made game, but still is fun some what!!!

Pros:
-Fun single player mode
-Awesome level designs
-Creative story somewhat, fun missions
-Jedi Power Battles and Tomb Raider all in one package

Cons:

-Lousy graphics
-Way too easy

The battle system is ATB system much like the older games but with a bit more on the active side. The overdrive moves are awesome and the summons can be used as playable characters, which you can even, upgrade their stats. Puzzle solving is a big thing in this game much more than I have seen in other games but it is a challenge and fun all at the same time. This game Although not m favorite Final Fantasy game is up there with the most enjoyable to play one of the most beautiful and one of the most insightful.

Tidus is the main character- a popular sportsman whose main passion is the sport of Blitzball- a soccer like game.  That is until his whole world and existence is changed by Sin- a monster that destroys everything.  With the help of his allies, Tidus goes on this great adventure to defeat Sin- along the way he fights the typical FF battles, gains experience points, levels up and learns new tactics and of course, meets alot of allies/friends.
Besides the graphics, another standout in this game are the mini games- such as Blitzball that you can play in addition to the main storyline.
 Another FF addition is the sphere grid where you can take control of the character's development.  Alot of other reviewers disliked this part of FFX, but for me, it was great to have control of my character's development- it lets the gamer decide which way to strengthen a character, which spells/attacks to learn first etc.  I will admit, it was confusing at first.
Overall- a great game- well worth the price it will give you hours of game play!",A great RPG..,1067040000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

At first when I went to Surdana and found a lot of people I notice that most people had looked the EXACTLY the same except for the Blacksmith,Qualus,Lady Myschala,Genrel(I forgot his name),and Sorecess Jade. Also the villians like Khesoll Vole and Polta looked the same. Something really buged me about this plus instead of fighting 5 different monsters you fought 5 all the same. When at the tree in the Shadowmire I noticed there was a down fall in which I had to jump or go another way. When I jumped down something bought me up to the start menu and saved my game over the file I had saved and when I died and went back to my game I kept dieing so I had to start another game. Now dragon loses,this happened a lot. First when I went through thee Yeti tunnel Arokh said he'd stay right there,when I came through another tunnel I called him and couldn't find him. He finally came after I called him for an hour. Then the path to Northern Tundra I didn't think Arokh would be able to pass through it so I left him outside the tunnel. When I went out the other end of the tunnel I found myself to be caught in a trap with 2 blackwings which I couldn't target(you can't target flyers when your Rynn which stinks),so I went back. I came back and Arokh was gone I saw his shadow but no Arokh I called him and nothing happened. I fell of the cliff where I get to Tundra and there was no way up,and couldn't go back to the Ilses because no one would led me back,and I couldn't go through the portal with out Arokh. I lost my dragon and had to begin on my other file. It's rather a bomber you can die from falling with no help. I liked the game but after seeing the same enemies over and over got me bored. It was a good game and tought me to expect the unexpect and that theres something around every corner.

3,False,"05 5, 2002",A3RRY485FDAS31,B00005V5LP,D Critique,"I don't doubt that this may be the best baseball game for PS2 and standing alone I would have given the game 4 stars, but compared to last year there is little improvement.  High Heat 2002 was a great game for its game play, but had horrible graphics and some kinks to work out.  3DO did little to improve the game.  There are some improvements from last year however, most noticable is the improved look of the players, 3DO added a little more detail.  The stadium graphics have improved slightly, but still terrible.  The best thing about the game is that the overall game play remains the same, so the game is still very fun.  However, the kinks are still present.  The worst is the shifting of camera angles when you are trying to catch a fly ball.  As the camera angle shifts the direction you are moving the player shifts so it takes you off the ball or you just may lose sight of the area you are running to.  Also a huge flaw in the game is that that camera angle doesn't shift when the ball is thrown past a man, it maintains a close zoom on the ball so you cannot see any of your players no matter how far or close they are to the ball. You may throw it to first for an easy out and the ball gets past the first baseman; you no longer can see the first baseman, so you cannot direct him to the ball, the runner usually ends up scoring or getting to third.  The last major flaw with the game is that during the playoffs the game switches from a calender mode to a tourament layout.  This is unrealistic because you could win your series in 4 straight while you wait for the other bracket to play 7 games, and your pitchers do not get any rest in the 5 days off.  The only pitcher that is ready to go is the pitcher that would have pitched in game 5. And the other pitchers still need the full 5 man rotation to get fully rested.  And again, there is NO FRANCHISE MODE.  Team sport games should not be on the market without a franchise mode.  3DO would be far ahead of the competition if they can incorporate a franchise mode using the Minor Leagues. And how about some type of celebration after you win the World Series (there is absolutely nothing).  Also when a player dives, it takes him 5 seconds to get up (which is way too much time).  Also the dive and jump button are both the same button (triangle), so you may want to jump but computer causes you to dive, and then you have to sit on the ground for 5 seconds before you can get up and recover the ball.  3DO needs to seperate the two movements.  I really don't understand why 3DO did not fix these flaws since they were in High Heat 2002.  The game this year has players in the dug outs, but they are still figures that don't add to the game. After a player scores,he still walk over to the dug out and then disappear.  He doesn't enter the dug out, he just diappears.  Hey 3DO, how difficult is if for them to walk down stairs to a bunch of their teammates and slap their hands or get angry and throw a bat or just sit down?  The game still keeps excellent statistics, but they are very difficult to navigate through.  For example, you cannot simultaneously see the person with the highest batting average and the team the person plays on.  This goes for nearly all the stats, the team name is not fixed as you scroll horizontally so it is hidden as you check out the stats.
However, this game is far from bad.  The game play is still terrific and realistic.  You can now adjust the game to whether you would like more of a realistic or arcade feel.  So it is attractive to both type of gamers.  I like realism so my review is based on my perspective.  The pitching is realistic and you must select carefully where to place balls with certain players.  Players also have hot streaks and droughts just like in real life.  Also a player can perform better or worse than what is expected, which is also attractive about the game.  The game remains to be realistic and fun to play, but I expect that a software company can improve on its titles annually.  3DO dropped the ball with improvements and this game is far from perfect.  I would still recommend the game if you are looking for a baseball game, however I would rent it first to see if you like it.",Not much better than HH 2002,1020556800,5,,

Gameplay 9/10: For the most part of the game you spend kicking and punching vampires, zombies and other kind of undead in your quest to save the world and to know whats going on, im a fan of the show and I loved the gameplay! you can have alot of weapons, including Stakes, crossbows, mops, brooms, and a water gun filled with hellfire and holy water which is good to dust vampires and other kind of stuffs. The control here are sooooooooo simple, you use X to punch and A to Kick if you combine this button, you can release good combos against your enemies (While holding the last button the game will change in slow motion for like 5 seconds, buffy will glow purple, and she will unleash a combo with more damage to the enemy) the Y is the use button of the game, you can stake (If you have a weapon), open doors, take items, etc. if the B button you Jump, with the L shoulder button you can look in a first person mode! this is useful since if you are low in health, you would want to look into an area first! the R shoulder button is to target and enemy, (you can also enter a first person mode with the crossbow when you are equipped with it, this game is a must!) I found that in Chaos Bleeds the vampires are wayyyyy to easy to kill, well here... you have difficulty, Easy, normal and hard! you can decapitate vampires with shovels and the reaper blade too, burn with holy or hell fire, you can stake em (sighs) and there are manyyy ways to dispatch your enemy, don't have stakes?? throw your vampiric foe to daylight (In some levels, like Angel's Mansion) want to dispatch your enemy quickly?? if there is a table turned over with a sharp leg, you can toss it there and it dusts! an interesting thing about this game is that, if your bar is depleted you don't die actually, your enemy needs to perform a killing attack (Such as biting your neck, or stomp it, fire.. and stuffs like that) and buffy dies, same apply to the enemies, you need to stake (You can also throw your stake, and if you catch your enemy off-guard it will dust him/her instantly without you having to deplete his/her energy bar) or burn, decapitate them! wayyyy too funny. The reason that I gave it a 9 was because sometimes the camera angles will get you in trouble, but is not a big deal and the fact that buffy cannot swim, rofl.

Sound (Music) 9/10: The sound in this game is veryyy detailed, you can hear buffy breathing, which is hilarious, when she is walking down a hallway (sighs) when some of the vampires growl (Ripped straight from the show) and many many other things, the voice acting is the better than i thought, Everybody plays their RL counterpart except for Buffy, but the girl in replacement sounds a lot like SMG! which is good, thats why I gave this a 9.. Also the music, when you are walking, you can hear a spooking music playing on the background, and when you are fighting with some vamps, you can hear some excelent tunes, is like tecno or something like that but is different than the music in chaos bleeds, is not that kind of music with the theme (u are going to die!! no time to escape) like in chaos bleeds, so is a good adiction to this game (the themes in chaos bleeds sounded better but...)... Also.. Buffy has some witty comments to says to the enemies (Like in the show) but after a little while it gets veryyyyy repetitive, funny, but repetitive.. it doesnt bother me really, but couldn't they just added more??

Story 10/10: This is a Beat em up action game for the xbox see?? but it has an incredible story! the actual writers from the show wrote this one, involving the master coming back, and some of other unfamiliar foes, (The game is placed somewhere in season 3) they are trying to resurect The Master, which it occurs, but in a phantom form, so he searchs for a body, Angel.. then Angel is posessed by the master, and you need to fight him to weaken the master while willow and the others perfoms a ritual to get the master out of angel's body so buffy wouldnt have to kill him... and then the rest you will find it yourself, this is a good story, you feel like you are inside an episode of the show :), there are bad moments (Such as angel posessed) and good moments with witty and funny comments and stuffs :).

Graphics 8.5/10: This game is a master piece, it success in not being repetitive! even you get to go to the library between some level and have an actual conversation with the scooby gang!! is more like an scooby reunion, nothing like Chaos Bleeds, you need to talk to them the way you want and stuff, they give you tips, and it futhers the story of the game, xander sometimes will give you weapons, willow will increase your power and health bar if you give her the crystals.. and giles will give you new combos and a cool weapon later on the game with the name ""Reaper Blade""! cordelia will just.. speaks.. lol, but anyway she is funny. another interesting thing about this game is that, buffy will change her emotions, and a big huge difference from chaos bleeds, is that the charater model will actually move the lips when buffy makes a witty comment! wayyy too detailed!

All in all... Buffy The Vampire Slayer is one (or was) cause the game was made in 2002, one of the best action beat em up game for the xbox, its a classic, and non-fan of the show can get into the story going to the extra menu and choosing buffy history 101, it explain everything about buffy and the concept of the game, there are some codes that you can unlock an arena mode, and you can even play multiplayer inside it!! the first control being buffy and the other ones controls the enemies (even bosses) :), you can also do that in the story mode, cause the arena mode has a bug and it lets you to do the same in the game (Nope, it will not affect your game disc or gameplay), fans of the show they need to have this game! is a classic, and again.. most of the non-fans should pick this up, don't ignore this game cause it has Buffy's name.. this is a good action game, and a classic, way better than Spiderman.","Buffy is a Classic, Even For Non-Fans of the show!!",1123891200,4,,

It captures all the elements of previous Blizzard titles including WarCraft 2, Star Craft and even a good bit of Diablo 2. I here people complaining about how there is less strategy in this game then they would expect, and yes this is true. Blizzard told that they were going to do this because they wanted more room for RPG elements in the game that their other strategy games didn't have. This move, in my opinion, improves the game immensely. Think about it. You do not have just spells and abilities that are seen in RPGs, but also leveling, optional questing, and good story. The single player game plays more like a RPG story rather than just missions to get to the end. The involvement of the story can be very easily contrasted to Diablo 2's story. What I am trying to say is that this game is a small RPG game in a very good and intense strategy game. Anyway, the graphics are very well done.

Problem is that it gets boring after awhile.  The 49 cars are the unlockable cars and he said you start out with a lot of choices.  I don't think 7 cars is a lot of choices.  The physics were unexceptable and certainly more unrealistic than anything else I've ever played.  It was like Crazy Taxi.  Anyway, the game gives you a lot of modes to play in, however all most all of the challenages are only allowable with the game chosen car not one of the many you unlocked.  I managed to get 11 cars unlocked in the first day of play, through cheat codes and plain skill.  But many of the earlier unlocked cars are worthless and they keep using the same tracks in these beginning challenages as well, so the lack of variety is the downfall of this game.  It was a fun pick up and play game and that is why it gets 3 stars and the game was fun but after HOURS of playing it, it just didn't stack up to Nascar Thunder, Gran Turismo, or even Simpsons Road Rage.  The pursuit modes in this game were easy for me and I've never played Hot Pursuit before.  I think the developers should have considered waiting with this title until they could figure out better graphics, better physics, and some weather.

I remember people were clamoring for this one as well as Grand Theft Auto 3 (still are for that one).  If it's any indication of how great this game is, I rented both Wreckless and NBA2K2 but found myself *reverting* back to a game I have already been playing for more than a month.
I have but one more goal before I finish the game (500,000 score on Cruise Ship).  I'm very satisfied with how this game challenged me from the moment I started playing it.  I was a decent THPS2 player but the new revert feature adds so much to gameplay.  The humor is more visible and well done as well.
I ran off what I thought was a decent run on the Tokyo Mega Mecha stage only to watch in horror as I got about 20-30 points from each of the judges.

There are just a few things to pick on: the textures and graphics are not as detailed as they could be, though it beats playing the PS2 version that looks like you're playing through a blocky mosaic).  The animations still seem a bit stiff around the arms, the menu and clothing load pause times are a bit much, and Neversoft should take a cue from Amped when it comes to the media/spectator concept (and the voltage/excitement meter).

The player plays an immortal wizard, and can control different races (Dwarves, Elves, Draconians, etc), each with its own special units. The player can learn specific spheres of magic (Air, Earth, Fire, etc). The main difference, in my opinion, between AoW2 and other turn based strategy games is that there is a story line. Basically, there are twenty episodes. Every three episodes are a part of a ""Sphere"" story, such as fire, air, water, and the character you develop continues in them. (If you learned X spells in episode one, you'll still know them in episode three). However, the story continues in all the episodes sequentially - episode four follows episode three. I'm not sure exactly how that makes sense (how can the player forget what he learned between episode three and four if the story continues?!), but that's how the game is. AoW2 is pretty much a ""standard"" turn based strategy game. However, the graphics and music are gorgeous. I've never played a strategy game with such richness and depth: all the units are animated, and are absolutely a joy to watch. Strangely enough, the tactical AI (I'm usually too lazy to actually do my own tactical combat, I like to use the 'Auto' feature and watch) is beyond terrible. I've seen times I attacked an enemy with ten of my units against seven and lost without killing a single enemy unit, and when I controlled the combat myself I won without any loss. This happens ALL the time. I've stopped using 'Auto' because of this feature. I wonder why AoW2 is so bad in this aspect.. never seen anything like it. Other than that, the game play feels pretty much like other games of the genre. The scenarios are somewhat repetitive, but it's such a refreshing idea to be ""forced"" into a situation, and the scenarios are different enough that you have to try different tactics.
Overall, I think AoW2 is really a great game. The AI could use a serious overhaul, but it's still a lot of fun.",Good Turn Based Strategy Game,1027468800,16,,

I should have listened to the reviews that downgraded the game.  I actually found the play at times fun, but the game crashed 2x out of 3 games.  Not good. That it crashed during the only enjoyable game I had, well, was not reasuring.  The addition of new pitch types was a good change.  The circles to assist fielding are WAY to large and intrusive.  The game often required six or more imputs to get it to accept the pitch selection.  (Yes, my sidewinder was calibrated, and works fine with other games.)  This totally interrupts the flow of the game, and is very frustrating.  The player graphics look like they were taken from an arcade game and not as realistic as some past versions.  Some of the animations are really entertaining.
Overall, I was very disappointed.  Getting a console game, wrapped in a pc package to me is unethical.  The menus are flat out awful.  If you want a console game to play on a pc, well, this is fair.  As a pc game, it is poor.",High Heat 2003,1048291200,4,,

3,False,"01 23, 2005",A2XPR7L66F8CU7,B000067FDW,Kelli,"Perhaps the best way to describe WOW is that is an MMO that is designed to appeal to non-MMO players.

The game is visually impressive (cartoonlike graphics, but very appropriate for the Warcraft world), and is extremely accessible and easy to play, even for a casual gamer, or someone who is not very famililar with MMOs.  The game can be played in various ways, but the quest system, as one way of playing, is generally well designed, well thought-out, easy to follow and fun for quite some time.  In general, WOW is a fun experience for a while.

The problems creep in by the time one gets to a higher level, and in WOW this happens much more quickly than in other MMOs because the levelling system is far easier than in virtually any other MMO to date.  The quests get very repeptitve (not only same type of quests, but same monster, just a bigger version of it) and are far less entertaining once you advance in levels past, say 40.  And beyond questing/grinding, there is not much out there to keep your interest in WOW.  The PvP system either consists of ganking (on the PvP servers) as in previous Blizzard online games like Diablo, or in town raids which are fun the first few times and then are much less fun thereafter (essentially getting killed by endless amounts of level 60+ guards who spawn and spawn and spawn) .. so unless you wish to become a dedicated PKer on one of the PvP servers, the PvP aspect, while sometimes fun, also lacks staying power.  The tradeskill system is both extremely easy to advance in and not particularly rewarding financially or in terms of game play ... it adds something small for the dedicated player, but the game is designed so that a player can get along fine with no tradeskills at all. and even without access to the tradeskills of others (a clear sign that this is not really designed for MMO devotees).  So after the lustre wears off from the questing and such and the initial interest in exploring the nice world that Blizzard has put together, there isn't much else to keep one's attention other than doing the numerous instance quests for higher level characters, which are very time consuming and also somewhat repetitive.  So while WOW starts out well, if you are an MMO player you will prtobably find that the lustre wears off of this one faster than for the average MMO.

Blizzard was trying to make a game that would appeal not just to the MMO players market, but also to the extremely large Warcraft fanbase, a fanbase that is not generally an MMO fanbase: I think it was supposed to be an MMO for non-MMO players basically.  So they created a game that had the basics of an MMO without the depth, richness or difficulty that has been traditionally associated with MMOs.  That makes for an enjoyable game for a while, but also one that (at least for MMO players) wears off fairly quickly.  The power MMO players reached the level cap within a matter of weeks and reported that there was not much to do at the level cap so far in the game.  Even a more casual, experienced MMO player can reach the cap within 2-3 months at most.  I'm not arguing that harder/longer is always better ... but what I would say is that in an MMO environment you want a good, deep, challenging world that can keep you engaged for months on end ... at least that is what MMO players are looking for (but again I don't think that WOW was really designed for MMO players, but for players of non-MMO games who don't expect to commit to a single game for 6-12 months the way that an MMO gamer would).  The argument that the design was for people to have many characters so as to experience all of the game content also seems strange to me ... after the earliest level quests, many/much of the quests are the same for each of the factions, so it is like playing the game over again in large part, and that isn't very satisfying for many people.  And, again, for an MMO player it is easy enough to have several characters all very high level within a matter of 2-3 months, so this doesn't add all that much.

So pros and cons read like this:

Pros:

Extremely accessible

Easy to level

Streamlined gameplay without obvious time sinks

Fun for a month or two

Cons:

Quests and monsters are very repetitive

Not very much depth to game

Tradeskill system an afterthought

Graphics outdated

Ease of levelling = bordeom level reached more quickly

So, the summary is that if you are a non-MMO player and want to try an MMO this is a great game to get started in the genre.  If you are a WC fan and just want to play the next WC game, this is a great offering as well.  And if you are a MMO player, you can also play this for fun as well, but don't expect it to be as long lasting as for some other MMOs.  WOW is a fun and impressive game, but one that has less lasting appeal than many other MMOs have had over the years --- probably by design so as to appeal to a broader group of people (and in that respect based on sales and subscription figures, Blizzard seems to have succeeded).","Great at first, but little staying power",1106438400,8,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

After all, I am a huge SW fan.  I even liked the game a lot after I had gotten it and had played through the first couple levels.  The problem is, as you progress further in the game, you realize ""I'm not having any fun.""  A lot of the levels make it totally unclear where to go, so much so that you'll find yourself wasting 1/2 hour just wandering around through areas where you've already been and wondering how to move on.  And the lack of camera control is fine in the early levels, but once you've gotten the jetpack and you have to do a lot of jumping around from platform to platform, it really gets annoying when you can't see where to go next because the camera won't move while you're hanging from a ledge.  My final criticism is that the actual bounty hunting seems cool at first, but winds up just being an annoyance.  When you get your first 5-10 bounties, you think it's a great new idea that makes the game interesting.  But then you go on, and you'll be in a situation where you have 20 guys shooting at you, and you can't take the time to scan for bounties without getting killed, and you can't control Jango's targeting efficiently enough to only shoot the guys who aren't bounties. And you start thinking, ""how is the bounty hunting really adding anything to the game?""  And you start wanting to just ignore that aspect of the game entirely and just treat it like a normal FPS.  But then, if the central theme of the game (i.e. bounty hunting) seems pointless, that's a sign of a big flaw in the game design.
Now I'll talk about things I liked...
The FMVs, voice acting, sound effects, music, graphics
But in the end, this game just gets annoying because of poor level design, clumsy controls, and restrictive camera control.

I have not had the fortune to be able to play Gothic(1), however I am ordering a used(hopefully only slightly) copy.  I wouldn't buy a new copy unless you can get it for next to nothing(won't happen here on this site). In Gothic 2 as in 1, You start out a weakling with no experience(well, actually you HAD experience but a deamon of some sort gave you brain damage or something and weakened you physically) One thing that bothers me is that sometimes the ""good"" thing to do is not going to gain you much of anything(even prestege).  For instance, the farmer's clothes you toil hard for, and also pay for in the fields, does nothing to gain entrance into the city. Buying wine for the farmers isn't work at all, and costs you more than not doing it so I don't understand the significance. You can easily enter the City in your underware(or whatever that outfit is) bypassing the farm altogether and get a writ or bribe the guard(as documented in the manual, no spoilers here)  The "" evil favor"" is easily corrected and you get a very nice wheapon(better than the farm clothes)+ some big money!  I'll say no more.  The combat is also laggy, as it involves holding down the left mouse button and hitting the ""W"" key multible times. The S/A/D keys are your guard, and slash right/left respectively but they hardly work, unless you let go of a target. The arrow keys also work, but it is easier on the arms to use the SAD and mouse. The good thing is, you can take down virtually any beast with a quick ""W"" tap and some dodging rather than letting it go by chance as in Baldur's Gate or something.  Most beginning monsters can be taken down for fish and experience easily(but you pretty much tear up your keyboard doing it).Get a Saitek keyboard/keypad combo, thier indistructable.  Go hunting with a partner for free XP. thier are two in town who would willingly go with you on an expedition in the wilds .  NPC's are rather Drakonian which means they all hate your guts and this makes it hard to stay alive(even in dialogue).  Once you even slightly offend someone he/she/it instantly attacks you and you instantly die(usually without attacking or being able to.)  Even self-defense is frowned upon which sucks in real life as well as in this game.  If the bar drunkard attacks and you fight back, everyone in the area will bash you until you die horribly.  It does not make sense that your ""heroic"" character who fought a deamon recently and was very expericenced should all of a sudden become a noob.  You'd think killing a ""Sleeper"" would make him wise.  Although being a weenie is a good start in RPG gaming terms it doesn't tie up with his previous experience and plottwise it makes no sense.  You should play a new charater.  A deamon can of course distroy muscle fibers making one physically weak, but the PC is also dumb, foolish and his dialogue choices limited which sucks.  Not to mention he can't fight back in town which is unacceptable.  Even the Ultima series let you defend if another attacks you!  By the way, Ultima is exactally what this feels like, particularly Ultima 1(with good graphics).  Your quest is for gold and kicking tookus, not for virtue.(which is always a good start).  I have a feeling that by Gothic III you will have to answer to Innos for your misdameners and senslessly beating people up, and like Ultima IV, you'll have to prove yourself in a benevolent way(but that is just a hunch).  The best thing about this game is the guilds.  You can start over at anytime with a new charater and it is the funest part trying to get a regular job and making it to the top.  Mercenaries are hard to join and as mentioned above is inconsistant as you get killed instantly if you don't level up to 5 or someting.  By that time, you've already joined the Milita becasue it is impossible to travel the dangerous lands if you are anything but level 5 which you can't get to without gaining EXP in town(by getting a job and joining the Milita).  Mercenaries are funner as you can stab people in the back without consequence and of course stealing will not keep you from being elite in your class.  Figthing rats is not going to get you to LVL 5 to become one, however.  Insidently, if you don't join the thieves guild you die!  You cannot fullfilll the quest to kill the thieves unless you are a very high level, I don't see how this is easier in joining the ranks(as mentioned by the Guard Captain) than just getting a job hunting wolves. The music is beautiful, no complaints there. It always sets the mood wheather the spanish gitar in town or the chimes in the monestary or the obo and flute of the wilderness, it always sets the mood and is not loud or obnoxious as in other games.  The V/O talent is pretty good even the PC gets a voice, and a good one Many of the different NPCs speak in various American accents, Anywhere from NYC, New York to OKC, Oklahoma and a few Minnasodans, Texans and others making it a diverse and cosmopoloten world.  But they in no way detract from the Gothic setting and although don't seem appropriate it oddly enough works well in this game.
The graphics are better than most modern games, not because of cutting edge tech, but in the quality of the drawings.  Much like Ultima 9 very detailed by the artists rather than just depending on 3D modeling as in most other games.  I would even compare Gothic 2 to Morrowind. In richness and detale, it is second to none!  The sound is the same, great! Very detailed ambience which is very important and most games also lack. The monster lurking noises come through as many as 7.1 speakers but only if you have it. You can usually catch a firebug or a lurker behind you in the exact position hiding in the trees, couldn't ask for more than that!  Gameplay is the best part and the most important part as mentioned above I explaned it.  You can also cook, forge swords, and other fun things as well, just as in Ultima.  The game is very addictive and I just can't get away, despite the laggy controls and inconsistant quests, I would recommend it to anyone but play the first for familairity with some of the characters.  Lee especially.  Gothic 2 is avalable here from J&R, but Gothic 1 is only availble from separate sellers.  It is worth it to pick up a copy of both games!  I wouldn't pay 79 bux for the new one though.

First, the background. You're an adventurer in the 1930s whose father is missing. You track him down on an island, where you hook up with a woman to take on a mad scientist.
The basis of both of your armies is creature morphing. In essence you go around finding new creatures and snagging their DNA. You then go into your lab and can combine the body parts of ANY TWO CREATURES, and create your own uber-creature with the best of both!
This means the game is pretty much infinitely playable and is amazingly fun in multiplayer. Do you like dolphins and zebras? Why not combine the sleek swimming of the dolphin with the kicking hooves of the zebra! You can combine tigers and wasps. Leopards and oxen. The combinations are pretty much endless and it is quite a thrill to see how each one works out.
The missions in the game each call for certain tactics, as you learn how to go over, under, and through obstacles. But really the best gameplay comes when you take on other humans, and see how your favorite combos fare against their favorites.

My instructions stated that the patch had been included on disc 2...but it wasn't.  After doing an extensive search of both discs and finding no patch or folder containing a patch...I downloaded the patch from the site, installed it and played with it and in 98/ME compatibility mode simultaneously.  I have a P4 @ 3.2 Ghz and Kate was moving so slow...it was painful.  I needed both solutions and with them both I had a fairly good game without any hitches, glitches or crashes.

I purchased Syberia 2 years ago as a 9.99 jewel case bargain.  After playing Myst and its sequels, I didn't think I ever wanted to play an adventure game again.  Needless to say, I'm not an adventure gamer at heart.  Due to the lack of games written for the PC (as opposed to the now all too familiar 'adapted' PC games from consoles) I needed something new to play and this was what I was down to.

I installed the complete 1.1 GB game and it played well.  I was very impressed with the quality and construction for a 2002 game.

The graphics were stunning and slightly grotesque...yet I found them much more engaging then anything the Myst series offered.

The puzzles were simple and were more of 'hunt' than a solve...but it was entertaining...that's what I want...to be entertained.  This is a marvelous game for first time adventure game players.  The quality is very good...and with the patch (along with playing in 98' compatibility mode) the reaction time and controls are far more tolerable than the Myst or Drew games.

The musical score is hauntingly unforgetable and is the perfect compliment to the rich yet odd-looking graphics.

The story and the quality of the work are what drives this game. If you are looking for brain teasers or  action adventures...stay away.

If you want to lose yourself in a story for  a few hours...this is the way to go.  Lose yourself for a while and enter a different world.

Until you actually play the game, you have no idea just how tough this fellow can be! Bullets seem to bounce off of him, his health replenishes itself with the more carnage he causes, and on top of that he is armed with two heavy-duty pistols that never run out of ammo, and a coffin that also doubles as a rocket launcher. Oh, yeah, and he wants revenge against the Syndicate that used to employ him, and he means to get it without ever uttering a single word. Such is the premise for this anime action game which either bears an eerily coincidental resemblance to Monolith's ""Blood"" series or borrows from the games liberally. After all, you're an anti-hero resurrected from the grave dressed in semi-Western duds sporting heavy firepower, only in this case the game plays like a cross between ""Max Payne"" and ""Time Crisis."" It's good stuff, but good, at best, is all that can be said of it given some of the developers' very significant oversights.
The Pros:
 Excellent cel-shaded graphics bring you into a very creative and memorable world.
 Awesome cut-scenes, and an interesting, if sometimes muddled, storyline. This game is like playing a movie.
 The action is hot and heavy, and never relents.
 Your character really does feel unstoppable, and sometimes it gives you a twisted sense of pleasure to be taking on his in-game persona.
 Great soundtrack and sound effects.
The Cons:
 As I said, this game is like playing a movie - and it will probably take you as long to finish the game as it would to watch a movie. This game is inexcusably short-lived.
 The action is jaw-dropping at first, but prolonged periods with the game will eventually numb your taste for it, as it can get repetitive.
 Yes, it's a rush to feel as unstoppable as Brandon sometimes does, but he is so bloody tough that he is rarely imperiled (with the exception of some later boss battles). Looking for a challenge? Avoid this one.
This game is hard to recommend to everyone given its mechanics and brevity, but for those of you who want an arcade-style experience at home with a better story than most, this is for you. It's not deep, but it has style to spare, and I found it impossible not to enjoy it while it lasted. It just didn't last very long.

An entertaining game from the start, I must say that this game has run almost completely on hype from the beginning. PEOPLE, WHEN U START PLAYING THIS GAME, DO NOT EXPECT WHAT YOU HEAR. From what I have read in previews from countless magazines, this game was supposed to challange the likes of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Resident Evil. This is NOT true. The stealth part of this game has little to no effect on gameplay. True, you can sneek around in stealth position if you want to, but in most curcumstances, you will only waste time in places where you could just shoot enemies and lose them for good. Also, this game was expected to be a new beginning. Here are the ""new features""
 *you can now talk to others using dialouge that you choose
 *you wear different clothes
 *you now have limited strenght in climing, pushing boxes, and other things that in the earlier games would have been no problem.
 To be perfectly fair, the game does have great new flair, as there is now a darker atmoshpere no matter where you go. Even a church in Paris feels erily evil. The graphics are fairly good, but not much more. Characters, while exciting to see, are somewhat bland in appearance; though the environments are simply beautiful (though rather linear). The sound expirience is one that you cannot find in most other games; the orchestra that plays give the meaning of atmosphere a new sound. Tomb raider franchise has never been known for responsive controls, so don't expect them. They do work fine, and you will get used to them after about an hour (aproximately 3 levels for me).

 So will you have fun while playing this game? For me, the answer was yes. I enjoyed The Last Revelation far more than most people did, so this game was right up my alley. The point I would like to make is that those people looking for something new may be disapointed. The gameplay still remains with puzzles--some puzzles more challenging than others. You WILL DIE VERY OFTEN, and you will therefore learn to save after every completed puzzle. The graphics have a downside as just when things get truly beautiful, there is slowdown that reminds you this is only a game. The one thing that always keep nagging at me about this game is that there seems to be a spark missing from the earlier games. Perhaps that lack of Egyptian tombs? This remains unknown to me.
 To be fair, I give the game 3 stars. The game is for those who, frankly, don't want a change from older tomb raider games, and don't care playing for the story line more than for the gameplay.

While this game has tons of replay value, I was kinda disappointed with the lack of monster in-fighting, which is what made the classic ""Doom"" games such a huge hit and also made it funny at times.

The AI is not very good, but again, if you read accounts of Somalia and even see the movie it's obvious that the militia was not a trained army of very good marksmen.  They had numbers, numbers, numbers, a lot of guns, a lot of RPGs, and would just run into the street shooting at you.  You'll be picking off hundreds of people throughout this game.  If you finish all of the missions, you may likely kill over 1,000 people while losing less than 20, which is about what the USA did in 1993.  The AI of your teammates is worse.  They are bungling idiots with worse accuracy than Imperial Storm troopers.  In addition, they don't always listen to orders--when you're about to sneak around a corner your teammates will burst into an area and start shooting.  If an enemy is behind a wall, the AI gets confused and your men will shoot at the wall, even though you can't shoot through it.  Naturally, if you want things done right (enemies killed, missions accomplished) you have to do it yourself.  Many boards look the same, the enemies all wear the same few outfits, and you can only shoot x number of civilians before your mission ends.
It's still a lot of fun though, even if many boards are just trial and error.  There is also a set number of saves per board, though on only one board did this approach a problem (namely, the last mission).
On the whole the game is not very difficult, however it is a lot of fun.  The graphics are excellent--the rusted, blown apart remains of Mogadishu are well captured, and one gets an idea of how difficult and bloody urban battles can be.  You'll probably beat the keyboard with your fist after you get shot by unseen snipers or hit by phantom RPGs, but you just reload the game and take some revenge.  I loved the weapons selection.  However, I found little use for the sniper rifles on whole missions, which is a shame.  Since you have it with you the whole time, it's not very practical for going through the streets and taking on roving gangs.  You can break out some machine guns, like the SAW or the M-60 and do your best Rambo impression, raining red-hot lead down on hapless militiamen.  I liked the side arms as well.  The sound effects are fantastic--the hisses, pops and cracks of gunfire in the streets sound great.  It's amazing how much you can do with between two and four men; night vision goggles, flash bang grenades and silencers enable you to take down entire buildings in a couple of minutes, Delta Force-style.  Of course, your own men will occasionally run in front of you and take a hit, but again, they're not too bright.
There could have been more blood, which is a disappointment.  You get a lot of blood when you shoot someone, but they skimped on the gore factor, which given the real nature of the whole thing, they shouldn't have.  At least the bodies stay in the streets.  The people do some realistic dying on screen; they spin around, are blown out of windows, go flying from grenades.  Just like Hollywood (!)  You can see how accurate a CAR15 or M16 is by picking off people a few hundred yards away.  If you man the miniguns, watch out.
It might not be the best FPS for the PC (depending on who you talk to) but it's still a very good pickup.

I only have two knocks on the game, number 1.) the game is EXTREMELY linear, i.e. you can only take one path to complete a level with very little variation.  And 2) The final payoff, when you finally win the game is a HUGE letdown.  Granted, you're playing the role of an undercover stealth agent who shouldn't be basking in the glory of his/her victories, but we're talking videogames here, I want big hollywood productions when I win the game.  This victory felt like a retirement party.  I found myself saying","Good graphics, good gameplay final payoff a letdown",1095724800,,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

 When it came out in 2004, it had the best graphics of just about any game of the year, but they look kind of dated by now.  The voice acting and music are both very well done, and really brought the story to life.  It may be a bit to graphic for some (zombies can be sliced in half, and there's lots of blood), but other than that it's fine for young teens and older.
 There are tons of interesting weapons in the game, unlike many first person shooters I've played.  The Gravity Gun especially, but also the crossbow and those weird bug pod things.  The levels are interesting, with some neat little puzzles and situations.  The enemies are really cool; headcrab zombies are probably my favorite game enemies ever.  The vehicles added a surprising amount of emersion for me--I felt that being able to jump into a car, drive down a highway for a little while, then park and get out made the game so much more believable.  It doesn't really shine for the airboat sequences, unfortunately, so it's not until later in the game that you'll get to experience it.  Unfortunately, the whole experience isn't very long.  I've played through the whole game twice and only have 20 hours on my file.  And even then, sometimes the levels are suprisingly tedious--although only once or twice.
 The story is pretty good.  I thought it was extremely interesting, although others may find they hate it for its lack of apparent depth and few, fairly weak, characters.  If you like sci-fi, though, you'll probably love this story.  It's like early 1940s Poland meets alien conspiracy.  There are lots of subtle details throughout the game that reveal larger parts of the history as well--although I'm mostly not speaking from experience, as I found very few of these.  My one issue with the story is that it's sometimes just a tool to explain how you get from place to place, most noticeably when you go from an underground rebel base to an abandoned mining camp.  That was weird.
 The whole game is built with the free-with-purchase Source Engine.  It's a really good package for making your own mods and conversions, if you're into that kind of thing.  Personally, my favorite use of it is making the in game characters make goofy faces using the faceposer.  Of course, to get the game at all, you have to use the dreaded Steam.  I first tried the app for it, and, apparently since I hadn't bought anything on that account previously, it assumed I was a bot and prevented me from buying anything with my account.  Of course, it didn't TELL me that, so I didn't know, and just kept trying.  After several hours of it rejecting my purchase for no apparent reason, I finally found the answer online.  Then I had to email customer support to beseech them to unlock my account.  They responded pretty promptly, and I managed to buy it on my first try after that.  It's got to be my worst digital purchase experience ever, though, and I probably won't be buying anything else from Steam after this.
 Once I got past the Steam barrier, though, I found what an amazing game this was.  I've got to admit that it was definitely worth it.  It's one of the best games I've ever played, and at $10, if you can get Steam to work (use the website!), you cannot pass this one up.","Oh, wow...",1285545600,2,,

5,False,"08 29, 2012",A14ZS48R78ZK2J,B00006IJJK,SuperGamecube64,"On the Nintendo 64, many of our favorite series were brought to life in 3D for the first time. Super Mario 64 wowed us with fully explorable three-dimensional levels, complete with multiple challenges in each. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time stole our hearts as one of the grandest, and most cherished stories of all time. Pokemon brought our addictive and collecting tendencies onto the big screen. But where was Metroid? You see, Nintendo wanted to make a 3D Metroid game badly. Even Yoshio Sakamoto, the series co-founder was very itnerested, but Sakamoto couldn't figure out how the player would control Samus with the N64 controller. Eventually, Shigeru Miyamoto visited with a new development team in Texas called Retro Studios. Sure, they're made a few very good Nintendo games as of today, but this was back in 1998, when they were literally unheard of. As it turned out, Retro was on board.. Nintendo decided that wanted it to be for their next system to come, the Gamecube however. At that time it didn't even have the code name ""Dolphin""! So, they got to work, and eventually had a game that played somewhat similar to Other M, but Miyamoto intervened, scrapped all their work and changed it to a ""First Person Adventure"". Furthermore, 4 different Gamecube games were canceled entirely in order to focus on Metroid Prime. Was it worth it?

The Metroid Prime trilogy takes place between Metroid (or Zero Mission) and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Samus reveives a distress signal from a frigate called Orpheon, which also happens to be a space pirate ship. She arrives to discover that the crew has been slaughtered by their own genetically modified parasites. After destroying the parasite queen, a self destruct sequence initiates. On her way back to her own ship, a large electrical surge destroys most of her suit's capabilities (naturally). It is immediately after this, that she encounters Ridley, the space pirate leader she thought she had killed on Zebes. Ridley head towards a planet called Tallon VI, and so Samus gives chase. Upon landing, she finds that Orpheon has also crash landed on this planet. after a bit of exploration, she discovers that Chozo once inhabited this planet, but a meteorite crashed, contaminating the planet with a corrosive substance called Phazon and killing them off. Samus then sets off to take down the space pirates once more, but can she survive the Phazon herself?

Metroid Prime has great graphics, and effects for its time, but they have not aged well. Rough textures, low detail on certain enemies and pixelation are pretty common when you look at things up close. Despite this, the game is extremely atmospheric, mostly thanks to the music and the effects. As the game is in first person, you are actually looking out of Samus' visor, and it serves as the HUD. When you walk through steam, the visor fogs up. When an enemies explodes near you, blood may splatter onto your visor (it's all blue, or green). My personal favorite effect is when there is an explosion underwater, and the flash allows you to see Samus' reflection in the visor. Even the gun effects are great. For example, if you fire an ice shot, frost develops on the outside of the gun. The music is very atmospheric, low key, and fitting.

Samus is moved using only the control stick, and the C-stick is used for changing weapons. The D-pad is sued to change visors. You may be wondering how you can aim this way, but it is relatively simple. The R trigger locks onto enemies, and the A button is fire. Alternatively, you can hold down L to free aim, but you cannot move while doing this. If you feel this will be an issue for you, you should play this game on the Wii via New Play Control if you live in Asia, or via Metroid Prime Trilogy if you live elsewhere.

Despite involving a gun, and being in first person perspective, Metroid Prime is not a first person shooter. Rather, it is what Nintendo describes as a first person adventure. Combat is not at the forefront of this title, but rather puzzle solving and exploration are the main gameplay elements. Exploration is especially important, and something you will be doing a lot of. Just be sure to check your map as often as possible, or you will quickly become lost on Talon IV.

Metroid Prime is a great game, and a successful translation of a 2D series into 3D. Retro did an amazing job on their first game, and went on to create 2 sequels to Metroid Prime, 2 spin offs of it, Donkey Kong Country Returns, and Mario KArt 7. They are currently working on a Wii U title that is as yet un-named, but they have called it ""A project everyone wants us to do.""

Metroid Prime is a game that sucks you in, and doesn't let you go until you hit the power button. Over the last 9 years, I have created a total of 5 different game files on Metroid Prime. I only finished one of them, which was my most recent. You see, even though I continually gave up, got stuck, or became frustrated and quit, I always came back eventually until I finally completed this grand adventure. Is the game perfect? Not nearly, but is still a Gamecube icon. Did I mention that you can get this game at most used game stores for about $3?

Well anyway, the first noticable thing about the game is the updated roster. Many of the old favorites return, with new wrestlers such as Booker T, Goldust, nWo, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, and many others, the roster mirrors that of the current roster. Commentary does return to a certain extent, because this time the game includes J.R., King, Michael Cole, and Tazz all commentating. However it is not consistent commentating throughout your match, only certain parts of it. Despite the previews there are some voice overs, such as Booker T and Flair have talked backstage, and the crowd actually chants ""you suck"" when Kurt Angle comes out. The season mode is VERY in-depth. It starts out with the Brand Extension, which gives you the option of picking which show you want to control, Raw or SmackDown, and you draft your first 10 superstars, and the computer drafts the other.

Many backstage areas even have interactable ingredients, for example if you battle in traffic the cars will stop, or if you irish whip someone into a parked car it will explode and flip over.

3,False,"03 2, 2004",A3ME62ZG7A27KD,B00006JL1P,Aussiemystic,"Adventure games are often criticised for being worlds which are beautiful but sterile, with little or no character interaction.  In The Longest Journey, you visit many beautifully realised worlds - but although you're supposedly on an urgent quest to save the world, you spend hours - and I mean HOURS! - talking interminably to a whole slew of characters.
The basic story is fairly simple - you are April Ryan, and because of a special power you possess you can shift between Earth (or 'Stark'), a world where science prevails, and Arcadia, a world where magic prevails.  These two worlds are in balance, but something is threatening that balance, and it is your job to save the world (or really, both worlds) from the forces of darkness.
On top of this base, however, are a number of crucial items to collect, and an enormous amount of backstory and lore.  Someone has put an extraordinary amount of time constructing the story for this game, and it shows.  Fortunately, key items of conversation are automatically recorded in a log which you can refer to rather than taking notes.
The size of the back story is compounded by the incredible amount of dialogue with non-player characters.  Much of this is guff and waffle.  A simple question from you can provoke a five minute diatribe, or a substantial exchange of meaningless banter.  Much of this is put into the game to flesh out the characters, but after a while it becomes simply irritating.
Many of the puzzles are also contrived, although I found them to get easier and more straightforward as the game progressed.  You amass a fairly substantial inventory during the game, although once an item has served its purpose it will usually disappear from the inventory.  Making inventory management harder is the fact that some items contain important sub-items - like the eye of a doll - and some can only be used by combining two apparently unrelated inventory items and using them in a third location.  The first few 'chapters' of the game involve a couple of really absurd puzzles that suffer in this way.
Another irritating aspect of the puzzles is that many tasks in the game must be accomplished in a certain order.  You may already have worked out what you need to do, but won't be able to do it until you have talked to a certain person about it.  For this reason you need to go through pretty much every conversation option with every character, just to ensure that you have triggered any necessary events.  Where you have been visiting a series of locations looking for the way on, you may need to go back to the same location more than once in case, on the first occasion, you hadn't had a relevant conversation with someone somewhere else yet.
The game is divided into thirteen 'chapters', although some are extremely long and complicated whilst others are quite short.  Nonetheless, the chapters help to break up the story and provide you with an impetus to take a much-needed break.
Graphics are reasonably good, although the animated avatars for April and the NPCs can look a bit chunky and unrealistic.","Some nice locations, but needs a good dialogue edit",1078185600,,,

I'm a big spy-game fan in general, and we have all 3 major platforms, so I went into Splinter Cell curious about all the hype. It's gotten incredible ratings from several magazines. I have to say, after having played it, those ratings were well deserved.
First, the graphics. The amount of work that went into graphics on this game is just phenomonal. Your character goes through smoke and fire, through darkness and bright neon light, under shaded lattices, through light coming through venetian blinds, through hazy curtains, through punch-hole metalwork. It is just STUNNING. You really begin to believe that this is a movie and you're controlling the outcome.
The other senses aren't neglected. Sound is KEY and you are constantly aware of how much noise you're making while you're sneaking around. The speed at which you move, your crouching, your stance, all affect how well people notice you. Unlike other games which blast you with rock music, in this one you're so attuned that you hear the little movements of your own feet as you creep, or the movements of guards walking down the hallway.
The animation on the character is fantastic. Press up against a wall. Climb a fence and roll over the top. Slide down a wire. Go hand-over-hand across a pipe, and pull up your feet to get more traction. Slide down a ladder, jump up a wall and do a split to stay there, unseen. The way the character moves is just amazing. Some serious work was put into this effort, and it pays off.
The gameplay missions are logical and draw you along into the story. It's not exactly a ring-through-the-nose drag like other games. You are given objectives - ""Get object X which is in building Y"" but you aren't handed a map to follow. Instead, you're put into real-world situations and have to figure out for yourself the best way to accomplish that goal. You could try a frontal assault, you could try the sneaky back way. It's up to you, and your success depends on your ability to think through a situation and then implement your path.
The game even encourages you not to be violent. It points out that your aim is stealth, and that you should try to stay unseen and sneak by whenever possible. In most missions you can get through without killing anyone, if you use your head.

Why did so many people enjoy this game so much?  My theory is that someone switched the discs in my game when I bought it, and that I was actually playing a fake version of Suikoden 3 that really, really, REALLY sucked.

Well at any rate, I'll review the game that *I* played.

Suikoden 3 is terrible.  It is one of the most boring games I've played in my life, and I played all the way through it.  Up to the very end, I kept telling myself that the game MUST get better (based on the reviews I read).  Yep, right up to when they started rolling the credits I promised myself the game would get better.

It didn't.  Elizabeth R. Powell's review is actually a pretty good description of my experience, though I would disagree with her contention that Hugo's plotline was worth playing.  It wasn't.  The worst part of the game hands are the game triggers (those events that happen when you enter a certain place that ""triggers"" the game to progress).  Some of the game triggers are so random it's ridiculous.  Sometimes, the game doesn't even tell you what you need to do next (like the chapter you spend recruiting people, and you have to talke to EVERYBODY in ALL the towns you visit).  I spent countless wasted hours running from screen to screen trying to figure out how to progress that damn game, baffled because apparently I was supposed to know I to go to some remote corner of the castle to speak with some character I've never even met before.  How in the world was I supposed to know to do that?  And of course the overly high random encounter rate, coupled with the boring terrain and terrible music made the whole experience dreadful.

The story hardly makes up for the game either.  In fact, if the game had good gameplay, I'd probably complain about the boring storyline.  The uninspiring characters make you think Konami game designers flung darts at a personality chart to come up with their characters.

All in all, not even worth a rental.

Whether your a veteran of the series, like me, or a newcomer, seeing Samus fly and sumersault from platform to platorm always looks amazing. Not onlt that, but she can now bounce off walls and handholds, making every fight fast pace and just plain cool-looking. This new installment in the series follows off where Super Metroid left off, having Samus get infected by a newly discovered parasitic diesease. Miraculusly being saved by a cure made from the metroid larva, She now is sent to investigate a reasearch facility that has just been strucken by this diesease. I will admit that Samus now has some strange purple goo left off from the diesase and that looks a little silly, but, as mentioned above, her fast paced jumping moves look as cinematic and cool as ever, kinda like Dante (From Devil May Cry) and that Contra character no one can remeber the name of. It has the dark, moody inviroments although there not quite as scary as the abondoned, dark and bug-infested underground bunker of Super-Metroid, but an abondoned and quiet space facilty with mutated people walking around it and strange opvergrown vegetation crawling up the walls can get one just as emotioanlly involved in as the enviroment of Super-Metroid. Theres also a Samus clone that you constantly either sneak quietly and stealitly past, or make an epic and dramatic run from that always seems to end in a close call. Most of the most frantic and exciting moments of this game come from encounters with Samus's clone. The bosses are also some of the greatest I've ever seen in a 2D game. They all feel big, no, huge and sometimes gargantuan and look very intimidating. Plus, there are no real corny or fake-looking ways to beat them, once you defeat one, the fight will look very real and you'll beleave that it would be possible for a lone and small Samus to defeat such a large and overwhealming enemy. The endings (There are five of them), are also climatic and dramatic, and just like the clone encounters, always seem to end in a spectacular close call. Metroid Fusion is my favorite Metroid Game, and has instanly become my favorite GBA game. This game is very amazing, the strange and creepy enviroments are very compelling, the storyline could become a great Scince Fiction movie, Samus's sumersault moves are dazling to look at, and the bosses are the best looking and most fun to fight ive ever seen in a video game. You can really think about it hard, but never think of anyway this game could've been better. I have had a great expereince with this game, one of the best I have had with a handheld video game.

5,False,"11 12, 2005",A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B00007JZB3,Ethan D Van Vorst,"After reading through several of the reviews here I've noticed that the single most common denominator is that the majority of us are 30-something males who saw this movie in the early 80's and have had a deep affection for the basic idea of it all. I mean, c'mon now, who wouldn't want a few days *inside* the computer in neon highlighted clothes while throwing a guided Identity Disc at people and get to drive around in a Light Cycle? No other movie I can think of screams for some kind of sequel quite the way TRON does (especially in todays' computer-driven world), and Buena Vista has tried to fill the gap with this awe-inspiring game.

The plot revolves around an encroaching data corruption plague that threatens the computers of ENCOM, against the backdrop of a hostile takeover from rival corporation FCon (on paper it sounds like a Bill Gates-like boredom fest in the making, but it works out quite well). The main protagonist is Jet Bradley, son of Alan Bradley (voiced by Bruce Boxleitner himself), who is sucked into the computer world, a la Flynn, by Alan's brainchild computer program Ma3a (voiced by Cindy Morgan, Yori/Lora of the original movie). Needless to say the storyline is intriguing and wonderfully put into the aspect of the Digital World with such panache that I wonder how this game didn't do better sales than it did.

Graphics wise this game is a virtual feast for the eyes. Where Doom 3 might hold the title for most visually realistic FPS this game is by far the most beautiful. Syd Meade's virtual world comes completely alive in this game, and to get to be *in* it is a dream come true. Almost every surface of every character and object is gorgeously highlighted by the cool neon lines of Tron-esque cyberspace. There is absolutely no other way to play this game but on the highest possible graphics setting because to put it even a smidge below that would be almost criminal.

Gameplay is equally absorbing. You begin your stay in the computer world with your trusty disc weapon. There are a number of weapons you can pick up later in the game, such as the mesh Blaster (basically a machine-pistol), Suffusion (a cyber-shotgun), LOL (a sniper rifle), as well as a wide array of energy ball weapons. You'll find yourself highly reliant on your trusty disc though, and really there's nothing wrong with that as it's the most reliable weapon you have and a pure joy to use. In addition you can aquire various ""subroutines"" by downloading them from data bins located all over the digital world. These subroutines allow you to do various improved styles of combat, or give you armor bonuses, or can give you increased abilities such as jumping higher or running silently. Most subroutines start out as giant Beta versions which suck up a lot of space in your configuration, but can be upgraded to Alpha or Gold versions throughout the game, provided you can find the subroutine enhancement critter-thing (there seems to be one for each level). This increases the combat/power value of the subroutine while letting it take up less space in your configuration, thus allowing room for more. Quite clever indeed!

One of the biggest sells of the game is of course the universally loved Light Cycle. No one who tries this game can deny what a long-dreamt about experience this alone is, and the inclusion of the Syd Mead-designed Super Light Cycle only sweetens the deal further. Cycles zip around on racing grids and every sound you remember from the movies is there, from the digital ""thwip thwip thwip"" of your cycle passing over grid lines to the fantastic sound of an opponent running into your light-trail. There are admittedly some rather odd (and questionable) maneuvers that your computer opponents can perform that will have you shaking your head in disbelief, but overall the Light Cycles half pay for the game by themselves.

Jet begins his trek in the digital world hotly pursued by ENCOM's ICP's, basically Anti-Virus programs, who blame him for the spread of the corruption. With the help of Byte (an upgrade to Bit, from the movie) Jet travels from server to server, hard-drive to PDA, and all over cyber-creation. Some of these digital world locale's are genius in design and are pure fun to go through, notably the Net (complete with a pub called, quite cleverly, ""The Progress Bar"") to the old EN-8212 mainframe of movie fame. All the while Jet is pursued by ICP's and the corporate thugs of FCon, who seem obsessed with finding and capturing Ma3a.

As gorgeous and engrossing as the game is there are a few weak spots that prevent me from giving it a perfect 5 star review. Others have pointed out a dislike for the puzzle/key-finding aspect of the game, but I rather enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun exploring every nook and cranny of the Tron universe. But I will say that while most of the maps are great fun to experience there are a few that are outright frustrating. Right off the bat the PDA is a living, breathing nightmare to navigate and beat(can I get an Amen?). The old ENCOM mainframe is a lot of fun, no doubt, but something of a letdown when you discover that you can't find Tron himself but only a sparkly bubble known as the Tron Legacy Code. Further the FCon antagonists are quite a bit over the top in their sinister designs. The HR woman looked like she was on a 48 hour caffiene binge at any given time. And the tragically short encounter with the infamous digital Tank only left me wanting for more, in addition to the elsewhere-mentioned scarcity of Recognizers (the few times you see and hear them really bring this game out). And the ending was almost anti-climactic. This is a long game and to go successfully through it to an ending that was, shall we say, underwhelming at best, really just irks you.

I should note though that Tron 2.0 is left open for a sequel story-wise, but that the luke-warm sales of this game probably told Buena Vista Games that it wasn't necessary. And that's what really saddens me because the Tron universe has a truly rabid following. The Light Cycles alone could make a fantastic game in and of itself, and it's included in the package! The ending leaves a number of questions. Where's Flynn? Is the CEO of FCon who I think he is? And most of all, where the heck is the sequel???

5,False,"12 4, 2012",ANJP63IOCGMNQ,B00007KUU8,Smolderin&#039; Stu,"""Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"" is the PlayStation 2 sequel, released in 2001, to the critically acclaimed ""Metal Gear Solid"". Following the groundwork laid by the previous game, ""Sons of Liberty"" continues to provide a heavily cinematic experience with the same unprecedented gameplay.

Immediately noticeable is the vast amount of detail to graphics (at least for the time on the current console). The game's framerate stays consistent, and models and environments are smooth, with little to no graphical issues. The musical score, composed by Harry-Gregson Williams and Norihiko Hibino, is outstanding, with a contrast between symphonic and orchestral arrangements for cutscenes, and industrial and ambient tracks for in-game music.

The gameplay has evolved from what the original ""Metal Gear"", and even ""Metal Gear Solid"", used to be. The game plays similarly to the top-down view of the previous entry, but uses a lot of different angles for each area of the game. It retains the stealth element, encouraging sneaking through the levels without anyone noticing, and enforcing harsh consequences to those who happen to get caught. Enemy AI is smart and consistent, reacting to even the slightest noise or strange sight. They're also a bit more realistic than before; instead of Alert Mode activating immediately when caught, guards have to call for back-up, which gives you ample time to react and hinder, or possibly altogether stop, their progress. Guards are viscously brutal and tactical during Alert Mode, so much so that even the smartest player will have a tough time taking them down or even escaping them.

The game's story initially revolves around Solid Snake, but quickly switches it's focus to an original character named Raiden for the majority of the game. While a great deal of Metal Gear fans were upset by this, Raiden proves to be a interesting character on his own, backed by a tremendous voice cast and great supporting characters. The story contains many elements, such as betrayal, censorship, mind control, and conspiracies, with a constant, looming feeling that everything isn't what it appears to be. The game has a lot of backstory, and even tends to discuss future possibilities quite often. As the story progresses, old characters meet up with new ones, and the story manages to stay strong with a good balance of long, dramatic cutscenes and exciting stealth gameplay.

The attention to detail in this game is astonishing. There are thousands of small things that make the game so realistic, even by today's standards: Snake/Raiden can catch a cold which will cause them to sneeze, capturing guards' attention; laying across a pile of bugs for a while will eventually cause them to enter your inventory and slowly consume rations; the contents that come from shooting a fire extinguisher or even a bag of flour can reveal infrared lasers; you can hinder guards in many different ways, such as shooting their limbs to prevent them from shooting, or busting their radios to prevent them from calling for back-up; you can complete the game without using lethal force against anyone -- the list goes on and on. This game has so many possibilities that most designers today wouldn't even consider putting some of them in a game.

Concerning the re-release, ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance"", it contains the original game while including extra content. This content includes a variety of Virtual Reality missions (ranging from sneaking to photography), Snake Tales (new side-missions involving Snake in the areas of the game he wasn't in before), and a skateboarding mini-game (based on the company's game Evolution Skateboarding). The VR Missions are plentiful and extremely challenging, therefore offering a fair amount of replay value. The Snake Tales are also challenging, and are interesting what-if scenarios involving Snake in missions that take place throughout nearly the entire game with plenty of different challenges. The skateboarding mini-game, however, is confusing, frustrating, and extremely linear. It has several different goals, but the entire mini-game has a time limit; abysmal controls do nothing to help. Overall, this is pretty much the same package as ""Sons of Liberty"". Those with the original probably shouldn't feel out of place without it, but those who don't have either would probably be better off to pick up ""Substance"", as the majority of the extra content is worthwhile (if possible, I would recommend ""Metal Gear Solid: HD Collection"" for the best version of ""Metal Gear Solid 2"").

""Sons of Liberty"" isn't the longest game ever made, but the engrossing and extremely emotional story combined with varied gameplay makes this a revolutionary title. The story is exceptional by itself, but Hideo Kojima, creator and writer of the Metal Gear series, has gave it a life of it's own. With so much focus on government distrust, anti-war sentiments, personal freedom, and many other controversial elements, it feel's like a revelation; one that can open a players eyes to outstanding issues even outside of the game. It doesn't feel preachy or biased, but informative. I'm sure I've forgotten many things I wanted to mention, but this game has an abundance of content for having a linear style. In conclusion, ""Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty"" is even more of an accomplishment than it's predecessor, as it improves on all of the previous elements and provides many new features that push the game to it's limit. It stands the test of time, as it's enjoyable today as much as it was when it was first released. This game is truly a work of art.",A masterpiece,1354579200,,,

It is definitely not scarier than Resident Evil. Silent Hill 3 is a follow-up to the events of the first two games, and it is the key to the secrets that the town of Silent Hill holds. It sounds great, but in some ways it isn't too great. For example, the sound effects aren't very good, the combat is repetitive, to the point where seeing an enemy becomes a bore and a chore within the game.

We took this kind of unit stupidity in 1992 with Dune 2 when the RTS genre was new, but when is Westwood finally going to wake up, smell the coffee, and realize that they can't just keep putting new graphics on the same game, give a minor gameplay tweak here and there, ignore the AI and corresponding strategy elements, and expect us to dutifully keep swallowing it and shelling out the bucks?
What was the original C&C's gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Until someone edges out a win because they clicked slightly faster, or the tiberium is done and a victory is squeaked in via attrition.  Now fast forward to 2003 and C&C: Generals.  What's the gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Etc ad nauseum.
This isn't strategy.  In fact the so-called ""Real-Time Strategy"" has never been about strategy at all...it's just a marketing term to give a very rote, very brain-numbing kind of gameplay more of a cerebral spin.  Well a lot of us tolerated that lack of strategy and AI, with the hope that as the genre matured, Westwood would have enough vision (if not common sense) to finally put in a worthy AI and make these games a truly fun, strategic challenge to play.  Well they never did, and with what we're seeing, it doesn't look like they ever will...all they do is spend all of their resources - ALL of them - on graphics.  The computer ""opponents"" and units are all as stupid as ever, and once you learn the units and the rote action, gameplay is also just as coma-inducing.  :P
Save your money and your time.

-Great sound. Voice acting is awesome and never out of place.

-Cool stealth moves. I love hiding bodies and sniping.
-Just the right amount of gadgets to keep things realistic.
-Sam Fisher is super cool.
-Very detailed levels.
-Very responsive game play.

It should never have been allowed to get out there in the first place. The game is absolutely RIDDLED with bugs. There are dozens of things that RoboCop needs to do but the programming won't accommodate. Such as getting stuck in a location or walking up stairs or opening doors. The bad guys have no AI at all and end up firing at walls most of the time. They all look the same (guy in shirt with gun) and are really boring to shoot.

RoboCop's gunfire sounds like a Commodore 64 sound effect. And since when did Robo say 'Oh yeah!' or 'Bullseye' when killing someone? And why oh why is a giant mutated rat in a supposed RoboCop game?

The gameplay is terrible. The targeting system is rubbish (Robo will automatically target energy/ammo pick-ups and bad guys at the same time. Which is which? It happens too quick and it is useless too). I would have preferred the targeting system Robo has in the movies but here we get rectangles highlighting the bad guys. It looks stupid.

The music is trash too. I would play with the volume turned down. Or not play it at all. This game should never have been allowed out. Shame on Titus and Virgin Interactive for producing such a travesty.",Worst game I have ever played!,1073433600,12,,

Just for the heck of it last night i rented GTA Vice City and wanted to take it back after two hours.

Well, it's the same old, same old, with the Gaunlet/ Dialbo feel and the Balder's Gate look!!!

 The game isn't perfect either.....!!! Don't get me wrong it is a great game but, nothing special, well except for the 4 player co-op which keeps this game fun!!! I will admit the environmets were vast and unique, along with plot twists, nice weapon/magic combinations, side quests, and boss battles, along with the search for the for the 20 soul shards!!! The soul shards basicaly power up your weapon, for each 5 your main weapon powers up to a new level!!!

 Yeah, Yeah but if you play straight through the game you could beat anywhere from 10-14 hours!!! The boss battles are fairly easy, and the game is pretty easy, the only challenging part would be finding all the soul shards... which actually wasn't hard either!!! The camera gets on my nerves at times, and the gameplay gets bland and repetive after awhile!!! Their may be vast power up options and so-on, like I said it's the same stuff from most RPG's!!! The only two things that make this game stand out from the rest is the: Dunegons and Dragons name and .... of course the co-op!!! You choose from the: Fighter/Human, Cleric/Dwarf, Wizard/Elf, and the Rogue/Halfling... all 4 heroes who defeated the evil wizard Kaiden, now 150 later they are called upon again to save Baele from the ressurected and very much still evil Kaiden!!! Nice, story.....huh!!!!

 Yes,Dungeons and Dragons is fun, in fact a must have for any fan, but it could have been better!!! Just look at new next gen RPG's like: Fable, Star Wars: KOTOR, Star Wars: KOTOR 2, and Jade Empire!!! Although, D&D has the co-op and classic feel, it can't compare to the games listed above!!! Maybe back in 99' or 00' this would have been a great, and new innovative game, but being a good game, in an industry filled with awesome games it will be over looked!!!

Pro:

-Great news for Dunegons and Dragons fans

-4 player co-op

-Nice Magic and Fighting combinations

-Nice Environments

-Lot's of cool enemies

-A lot of player options

- When Gaunlet meets Balder's Gate

- Great Concept

- Classic RPG feel!!!

-Nothing original

-Bad camera

-Not as fun in single player mode

-Gets old after awhile

-Falls short of expetations, graphic wise!!!

-Sometimes Freezes Up!!!

And of course some other awesome games.  The game has bin hyped since 2002 and finally the wait is over as they announced the official November 9th release date.  Does this game live up to the hype?..does it outdo Halo one?  To answer your question my friend Yes!....and no..

Ok first lets get one things straight.  Bungie did an excellent job with this amazing FPS shooter.  The games visuals are breathtaking and the new dueling systems is just superb.  The game did get some pretty good scores like 9.8 on IGN but that's besides the point...HALO 2 is truly an amazing game.  It will be rememberd as one of the biggest Xbox games ever.  I salute you Bungie for this awesome game.  Visuals PERFECT, Gameplay PERFECT, Um....Good lengh NO.  Lets just get this down and over with...Lets start

Graphics

Graphicly this is the best looking Xbox game to date.  The graphics can be comparable to Doom3 Trust me.  Sometimes you'll just stop and look at the brilliant visuals on the water, mountain anything.  The lighting effects are unbelievable..  This game looks simply....AMAZING

Sound

The music from the original is back but with more of a remix and more rock(something like that) and that it self deserves a star.  The sound is extreamly detailed.  The gun shots from from shotgun sound simply....Real..

Bungie made no flaws on this part of the game....1 star for this one...

Gameplay..

The campaighn is wonderful with a pretty odd story that is a little different then Combat Evolves.  The game not only gives you the role of Masterchief but you also get the role of an Elite and once that happends it really starts to pick up the pace.  Bungie added some great features in this...

You can use the tank more often now unlike Combat Evolved were you only used it in one level.  Some of the most amazing parts in the game is when your on Earth(which is only 2 levels sadly)

But don't worry for all of you people who wanted to use the tank more often HALO 2 is here for you.  The campaighn earns a star.............and loses one(Uhhh I think)..

The campaighn is short...not(only 13 hours short) it's more like(7 hours and less, short).. And it ends very abruptly so if you're expecting a huge ending that was very cool and remarkable don't expect it in Halo 2.  It just.....ends...Or as most people call it a cliffhanger.  And No I don't have Xbox Live but I have played some good wholesome mutliplayer with some budds of myn at his house and it was friggin terrific.  Now besides that If Bungie didn't worry about the Xbox live stuff and worked more on the story it could have bin better.  I know I'll probably get negative reviews by some but This..

Is not the best FPS...C'mon it's not

It was a bit overhyped..

I thought EGM said on there really early HALO2 Cover stroy issue(it was when Vice City was just begining to get hype for the Ps2 before it's even out)that We would get to no more about Masterchief....HE BARLEY SAYS ANYTHING ATLEAST HE TALKED MORE IN HALO 1!

Over all verdict

+

Amaing Graphics

Cool Multiplayer

Superb Gameplay

Awesome campaighn story(yes I liked it unlike most game mag reviews)

YOU PLAY AS AN ELITE!  You can't beat that now?

Cons..

Just way too short

Cliff hanger ending...Just...ends...dammit..

Halo 2 has the potential to be the greatest Xbox game ever but ultimatley fails with its short campaighn and horrible way of an ending..IT's not even an ending if you think about it!  Lets not forget the superb multiplayer(man dueling weapons and using energy swords rule) This game is plain great and yes it was a bit overhyped but it does not dissapoint..

5,False,"04 28, 2005",A1Y2QN7WT8UKKW,B00008KTRS,Richard Baldwin,"Great Game!!!  I purchased this game with high expectations only to find that those expectations were right on!

It has a great story in that you are a gang struggling in a place called the junkyard to survive.  Each gang (there are about 7 of them) must fight with each other, and the last gang standing gets to a place called Nirvana.  That's where the game starts, but it takes a twist right off the bat!

The graphics and sound are great!  If you order the game now, you may be able to get the boxed set, which actually comes with the soundtrack, so you can't go wrong!  The graphics are the cell-shaded type, but it's very well done.  The tone in the game is a very run down civilization, raining all the time, and Atlus does a great job at giving that feel.  In my opinion, the dungeons are one of the best in a long time in a RPG.  It has a mix of puzzle and exploration mixed together perfectly.  The puzzles are very minimal but really add a great experience to the game.  There are a lot of places to explore, and there is actually some mini games mixed in as well!

The combat is where this game really shines!  It is turned based, but thank goodness it is!  With all the RPGs now going to real time combat (even FF XII is going to be real time), this game is a diamond in the rough in that it brings the turn base combat back with a challenge.  You MUST use strategy each and every time you fight, and if you don't, you won't last long.

The leveling up system in the game is also very well done.  Your character earns experience points after each battle just like every other RPG you've played along with currency.  The twist that Atlus has done to make each character very customizable is that you need to buy what powers your characters will use!  This adds incredible depth to the leveling up experience!  The faster you defeat your enemies, the more currency you get, so again, the strategy you use really plays a big part in the game.

If you are looking for a great RPG, with a unique feel, you can't go wrong with Digital Devil Saga.  It's a deep rewarding experience that any fan of the RPG genre will enjoy.",Great Game!!!,1114646400,45,,
4,True,"04 19, 2010",AVOXKGD4HU2SM,B00008JODN,J.P,"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was one of the most controversial video games of it's time. Many parents, mothers especially, were outraged at the amount of violence, the encouraging of crime, and the biggest culprit, the sex that is alluded to in the game. Well, as shown with ""Married With Children"" and ""Family Guy"", the only thing these protests did was made the game more well known and sought after. This is when I knew I had to have this game. With so many people talking about it, even if it were as bad as some select parents cried about, I knew it would still be good. Well, I was right.

Having played all of the GTA games, I would have to say that Vice City still ranks as one of, if not, the best of the series. Based on the early 80's, this game captured the era so well. From everything from the music on the radio, to the tacky clothing everyone was wearing, and even the fast cars you'd know automatically that this was definitely the 80's.

The soundtrack was defintely one of the highlights of this game. Not only did it make the game feel that much more authentic as you drive down the street in your Lamborghini Countach (differently named in-game of course), but the music wasn't terrible to listen too, either. The song selection is outstanding, and almost every song emphasizes the era in some way or another. The DJs of the radio stations are a little too stereotypical for my tastes, but the voice-over artists made it work. Commercials were generally comical and fun to listen to, and even to this day I still refer to Jack Howitzer and Giggle Cream as an inside joke.

The supporting characters were well placed in the game, and the dialogue was impressive. Each person was stereotypical in their own way, but to a humorous point. Many of the supporting characters don't last long, as they generally fade away the further into the plot you go, but even the smallest of roles were well done and seemed necessary even if they were not. I don't want to spoil the game too much, even though it being over 6 years old, so I won't go much more into the characters in the game. Once you play the game, you'll get a feel for it, anyway.

Finally, on to the gameplay. Being marketed as a free roam game is what made Grand Theft Auto the game it is today, and also prevents any game in the series from being just another game on your shelf. The fact that you can pop in the game at any given time, drive around killing people, or whatever else you deem fun, and it needing not have anything to do with the storyline is what, in my mind, makes for a great game. Well, in that aspect, this game passes on all levels. Mix that with one hell of a storyline and some of the greatest graphics of it's time, this game was amazing to play, especially if playing for the first time.

Now, as with most anything, not everything is perfect. While this game is amazing in many aspects, there are also some cons, one of which is the map size. When you start playing the game, you have to do a select number of mission to unlock the rest of the map, which to you at the time seems like a vast wonderland of murder, sex, and stealing cars. Not soon enough do you realize, however, that the map is very small. Getting from one side of the map to the other takes no more than 5-7 minutes, at most. Now the upside to a small map is knowing how to navigate it sooner; something especially good for missions, but if you want to roam around away from the missions, you'll find yourself getting bored within the hour. Another big downfall with the game is the damage meter on any vehicle. When doing missions, you need to get from one place on the map to another. Seeing the AI is terrible, you'll end up hitting a lot of cars/people essentially killing your car. This can be a huge pain if you're limited to that 1 car for the mission (i.e. Taxi missions) and the mission ends when the car goes A-Splode. Another thing is when a car flips upside-down, it immediately catches fire and blows up; another pain in the ass seeing you have no chance to steal another car and try to flip over your now totaled vehicle.

All things considered, this game is good. If not for the few cons that plague it, this would be a great game and get 5 stars. Cons aside, I still find myself coming back to this game time and time again meaning that Rockstar Games did something right. If you haven't played this game, I would indefinitely recommend it.",One of the Best GTA Games; Still Could be Better,1271635200,,,

While most people will buy it for nastalgic purposes, I highly recommend it to new school gamers, so they can see where modern RPGs have evolved from.
I remember beating the first Final Fantasy back in 1990, and was surprised to find that I remember very little of it. It is a great game, and the 16-bit upgrade suits it well (I doubt it would fare so well in 128-bit). The story is linear and simple, and the characters are a bit wooden, but considering how old the game is, I didn't mind too much. Final Fantasy 2 is also a decent, garden variety RPG, but not as good as the first one. I imagine that this will be like the Final Fantasy Anthology, where people buy it for pary VI, than complain to no end about how part V is not as good. They are both good, quality games that can please both casual and hardcore games alike.
The Playstation version comes with breif CGI movies at the beginning of the games, which are nice but do not make it worth the cost alone. The games are what make the package. What I particularly like about the Origins package is that it doesn't contain the excruciating load times that the Anthology and Chronicles packages had. That is a plus.

For those that don't know the game has pretty much turned inside out and died due to the NGE.  I left at launch of the NGE not happy with the changes that were made very simple.

About 1 month ago I actually gave the game the true try with the full NGE in place.  My opinion ranged from ""Wow look what I missed"" to ""Wow look how they screwed this game up.""

I created characters on 4 of the most active servers that I could find ran from place to place searching for people to group with and see what activity was on the server.

Needless to say I was dumbfounded.  Lowcam Starsider, Flurry and Chimarra all were the servers I joinned.  All VERY DEAD.  Mos Eisley Dead. Theed Dead, Dantooine, Dathomir all the same.  Over the course of a 14 day trial I could count on both hands how many people I encountered.

Entertainer's  were nearly impossible to find.  I encountered a total of 2 Entertainers to gain Entertainer buffs.  High End Equipment from Venders or Bazaar no luck.  I even searched through the map for venders listed on the map.

The outright hostility to the NGE SOE should have realized and reversed there decision.  On Lowca every city I visted there were signs visible of Anti NGE and needless to say I couldn't belive it.  Then upon visiting many of the popular hunting grounds I could see what people ment about the NGE killing the game.  Death Watch Bunker, Fort Tusken, Hunting on Dantooine nothing there so what's the point in playing?

During the time I played it was during the Halloween spurt where Mos Eisley and Moenia were the two locations to go.  Mos Eisley being that dead and figureing that city is the Starter City was sickening.

So needless to say I let my trial run out without resubscribing.  I'll continue playing the other MMO and make the decision on if I'll play the Knights of the Republic MMO when it comes out and more material is available on it.

1.  Secondary/DB AI.  There are WAY too many interceptions (I once had 20 in a season.  With one player.)  Also, enemy CB's tend to be smarter and react faster than your CB, no matter how good yours may be.
2.  Physics/Tackling: For the most part, Madden is quite realistic.  There are, however, numerous cases where the tackling defies physics, such as when a speeding 250lb FB is knocked BACKWARDS by a skinny, stationary CB, or when a defensive lineman runs down Michael Vick (yeah, right!).
3.  Offensive line.  To perform halway decently on the ground (and in the air, too), you will need a superstar back and an all-pro cast of OL.  Simply put, running with most teams is quite tough.  I know the big guys are important, but Madden 2004 seems to overemphasize their importance.

3,False,"07 15, 2003",AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00009KO3N,TwistaG,"The Resident Evil series is renowned for reinventing itself through innovations, but Dead Aim has one of the riskiest new ideas yet: reliance on the GunCon 2 peripheral for shooting sequences. Unlike the first-person disaster Resident Evil Survivor, Dead Aim's diverse play mechanics add spice to an otherwise routine episode of monster blasting and puzzle solving. Dead Aim is basically an upgraded version of Resident Evil Gaiden for the Game Boy Color. You explore a monster-infested ship and other locales, collect items and weapons, and fight for your life. Dead Aim, however, throws in a unique twist: access a weapon, and you automatically go from third- to first-person view for arcade shooting along the lines of House of the Dead. Surprisingly enough, the combination works but not without a few deficiencies. The system allows for rampant cheating, and unless the gun peripheral is perfectly calibrated, you're going to waste a lot of ammo, which is already in short supply. Dead Aim's also relatively short with few rewards for repeat players, and although it carries the Resident Evil prefix, its narrative isn't nearly as involving as that of other games in the series. Dead Aim uses a full 3D visual scheme instead of the trademark pre-rendered environments. The result is fewer offscreen surprises and a very clean look, albeit at the cost of environmental details (like candles and other objects). There's also a welcome emphasis on stealth tactics as you're forced to move slowly and silently through various areas, and make as little noise as possible during particular boss battles. Accessible controls keep the action in line, and even sans the gun peripheral, the analog-stick substitute is a surprisingly playable alternative to the GunCon 2. Yet despite the new look and other features, Dead Aim's still filled with traditional Evil clichs. If you're a huge Resident Evil fan or a newcomer to the series, Dead Aim's worth the time investment. Although it's a middling side quest at best in the context of the Resident Evil universe, it's an engaging action/shooter.","Good effort, but no",1058227200,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Those who went so far as to say it was the ""worst game ever"" should probably learn a bit about the over-use of hyperbole.  This is a high quality offering, at least for Xbox (PC gamers, I can understand your pain).

In some areas the AI was sloppy and inconsistent.  None of these lessened the impact of the story, however.

Horizons does many things right, but has a few things wrong with it that really ruin the game experience.
Graphics look good, but not always smooth.  A high end system is required to run this game and you'll be tweaking the settings even with the best of systems.  As the biggest memory hog game ever created, it will chew through 1 gig of memory real quick and a Radeon 9800 pro 256 becomes ""not enough"".  There's a good side of this though:  Even at low settings, it looks great and you will spend time just staring at the landscape and stars.  Like EQ, most lag occurs in high populated areas such as towns and cites probley a result of bad net code just as much as graphics.
Horizons has the best sound and music I've heard in a game.  They really spent some time and did it right and the music will haunt you once you hear it.  It changes as you enter different environments and really enhances your experience.  Game designers can learn alot from Horizons when it comes to the music.
The main challenge facing Horizons is it's content.  There's barely any at all.  The only real content you'll find in horizons is what you create yourself.  Quests usually involve collecting 10 things of ""this"" or kill 30 of ""that"" and are just plain stupid. Many quests will have you running here or running there being a mad messenger of sorts.  While this follows what's been seen in other MMORPG's, Horizons fails in it's attempt as there's no real sense of danger in it.  Dying in Horizons gives you a ""death penalty ticket"".  You don't have to get back to your corpse, no loss of XP, you just get a ticket that reduces your effectiveness for eight hours.  I have never felt this effect and can't tell the difference.  There is no fear of death in Horizons, no real penalty.  Go ahead and kill that big golumn, it doesn't matter if you die, you can just try again.  There's no real sense of adventure here.
Crafting becomes tedious.  The placement of resources in the game at higher tiers is designed to get you running back and forth for hours between gathering and processing of them.  While many things are done right with the way Horizons does crafting, it becomes a chore.  Spending four hours mining ore and creating things raising your level, then rinse and repeat.
Where's my monsters?  While other games had all sorts of monsters everywhere you run, Horizons has hardly any. They usually group in area's and can easily be avoided.  Even if they do come at you you can easily outrun them.  For fun I aggro'd an entire army of undead and tried to train them into town.  In other games this would be a horrible thing, but in Horizons they just head directly back and give up at a certain point - not going after anyone else they pass along the way.  Again, there's no sense of danger here.
Unlike others, the game bugs are providing me with an endless source of entertainment.  I don't get upset like so many others.  It adds a challenge when the game crashes right in the middle of taking on two higher level creatures, or right when my group needs me the most.  It adds a real world element to the game and sense of urgency as I scramble to get back in through the web portal they've created.  To me, this is a game feature that should be explored further and could really invoke some strong gameplayer emotions.  The Devs are scrambling.
I have hopes for this game.  There are many things to like about it and it seems a shame that it was rushed out the door so quickly.  They can fix it.

I think it's because everything about Halo is just right:  you have a clean story (cadging from multiple science-fiction staples), engaging--if simple--characters, and a gameplay that is both balanced and somewhat open.  As time goes by, the only problem I've encountered is, ironically, with Microsoft Windows Vista:  at random points in the game, my framerates drop to single digits with no apparent cause or cure.

[update:  the framerate woes don't get any better in Windows 7--I've tried it on Pro and Ultimate and the random slowdowns still happen]

The gamplay for Halo is just plain fun:  whether it's the steady drama of the single-player campaign or the insane mayhem of online play (warning:  obnoxious people exist in large numbers on the servers), Halo is an enjoyable way to kill some time.  When I say that Halo is ""balanced"", I mean that instead of a growing arsenal of more powerful weapons, you are always limited to only being able to carry two at a time.  This limitation forces you to think on your feet, and it rewards you as you make discoveries:  each type of enemy has different ways that work best to bring them down.  There is also just enough AI to make repeat gameplay not as predictable as Halo's predecessors.  This is what makes it more ""open"" than older shooters:  I've had fun trying crazy things, like destroying a tank armed with only a pistol and a couple of grenades.  I've also sometimes been surprised when an enemy does something differently:  if you stick a plasma grenade on a bad guy, they might turn and run back to their friends...or they might just charge straight at you and try to take you with them!

Just compare and contrast the original with this sequel, and the results are obvious.  GameSpot's review on this game is accurate, but it harshly condemns this game for being so difficult.  The difficulty, most would concur, is pronunciated in the beginning, where Zero has little health and must fight two Golems and a Mecha Scorpion...and survive the onslaught!  I admit I was a bit daunted by the number of mini-bosses in the game's onset, but after the first batch of bosses (namely after Phoenix Magnion) the game does not hate you as much.

The game's sprites look wonderful.  Mega Man Zero features more hand-drawn characters and landscapes, and that is okay, but Zero 2's looks are simply amazing for a handheld game.  Not only have the graphics sharpened, but the quality of the game's music has improved greatly.  Some of the stand-out tracks include the Train level, the Computer Zone (both the Rooftop and the base) and the Neo Arcadia Temple.  How can reviewers say that the graphics have been recycled from Mega Man Zero, when plainly the characters look more vibrant and well-animated?

The difficulty in the game is also increased by the number of levels where you largely depend on the Chain Rod to traverse.  The Forest of Dysis, for instance, got on my nerves because I had to jump a certain distance in order for my Chain Rod to grapple on the floating machine.  You can't get too close to the agent you wish to latch on to.  I learned that the hard way.  Another thing is to swing to the other side correctly.  In a very realistic manner, you to have swing back and forth to gain momentum prior to leaping across, or you may find yourself exploding to bits after 4 or 5 tries.

The cyber-elf system is a little easier to use, but it's not dramatically different from the first game's system.  Basically you talk to Ciel if you want to download a cyber-elf (they're basically sprites that endow Zero with upgrades and abilities), but some cyber-elves require that you feed them Energy Crystals, or you can't transfer them.  As the game progresses, you might want to consider downloading the cyber-elves that increase your MAX energy because the bosses get bigger (but not always badder).  Too bad this affects your Mission Result ranking permanently, for the rest of the game.  I can't complain however, because even though I finished the game with a C Rank, I obtained 99% of the EX Skills after each Boss Battle.

Cutscenes are considerably more abundant in this game than in any  of the other Mega Man Zero installments.  Particularly astouding graphics are what makes this game such an enjoyable experience, in spite of the difficulty setting and the acquisition of Zero's forms, which is my subsequent topic.

Zero grows stronger not only by the collection of EX Skills he absorbs from his adversaries, but also by obtaining ""Forms.""  These forms are like a physical evolution.  They can only be attained when you embark on a Mission:  That means you CANNOT obtain a form on an already completed mission!!!  That makes forms a rarity, because you get them only by performing certain kinds of actions.  For example, you get the X Form (so called because of X's weapon of choice, the Buster, and by the Form's color, blue) by KILLING 50 enemies with your Buster before the Mission ends.  If you want to know about Zero's other forms, check out gamefaqs.com.

The plot that drives Mega Man Zero 2 is as engrossing as the first game's.  After separating yourself from the Resistance Base for a time, Zero wants to find a purpose for living, as well as search for clues about his past.  However, he's in a rut, and he looks for Ciel and the Resistance.  When he is rescued by the Resistance Reploids, he discovers that the leadership and management of the Reploids has been passed down from Ciel to a mysterious figure named Elpizo.  He was formerly from Neo Arcadia, but he was ostracized (kicked out) and is now the Commander of the Resistance.  As Zero takes on Elpizo's orders to infiltrate Neo Arcadia and ultimately destroy it, we find that he's got a hidden agenda running.  The Dark Elf, a creature that used to be benign and which was X's hope to ending the Elf Wars a 100 years ago, is now a source of evil energy.  Elpizo is obsessed with the Dark Elf and will do anything to get his hands on its boundless power.  While this game doesn't reveal TOO much about Zero's relationship to X or their past, it doesn't mean this game isn't good.  It keeps you interested in what other things will transpire.  Play Mega Man Zero 3 and you will come to learn a lot, but you might not think that game as challenging or as fun as Mega Man Zero 2...but that might just be my personal opinion. :)  It's so much fun kicking the crap out of Leviathan, Fefnir and Harpuia, I'll tell you that much!","Sage, Fairy, Fighting",1140566400,2,,
2,False,"11 24, 2004",AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B00009WAUZ,John. N,"After dropping the pathetic bombshell that was X6 back in 2001, Capcom finally decided it was time to take the X series to the next level. Unforunately, as if things weren't already bad enough for the series, we all know that Capcom failed to make this conversion as painless as possible, and fans had another half-baked game to add to their Mega Man X gaming collection.

At first glance, Mega Man X7 has eveything one would expect from a Mega Man title. The the cel-shaded graphics are pretty nice to look at, considering X fans are used to looking at 2D sprite graphics. Beyond it's graphical engine, however, X7 does almost everything humanly possible to ruin the rest of the experience for the gamer.

To start off, the load times are way too abundant. Considering  this isn't a first generation PSX2 title, and the fact that games like the PSX2 Final Fantasy's have better graphics and faster load times, this is just unexcusable (even if the load screens do act as continue points). Next is the horrendous english voice acting. Considering the fact Capcom conmpletely disrespected US gamers but not even bothering to add english voices to X6, this is a little more tollerable in my book (at least they tried - I guess).

Another gripe is we're still treated to the same still shots and text story scenes as in X5 and X6. I though the jump to a 32-bit system to a 128-bit system would actually mean something here, but no. You'll have to beat the game to see ending - the only VMF in the entire game, excluding the opening.

Gameplay is where Mega Man X7 commits the most serious of its crimes. The 2D sections of the game play well enough, even if the auto-aim is a bit glitchy at times. 3D sections don't even play half as well, as camera problems creep up continously, forcing players to make some jumps completely blind (don't get me started on having to rotate the camera in conjunction to shooting in some boss fights just to see your attacker...). Even worse is the mass of slowdown one will experence, espcially during the boss fights, were the game slows down to a crawl. Level designs are decent, but it is pretty sad considering one can find all the hidden power-ups without much exploration (I didn't even have to consult a guide - I found everything on the first playthough).

Most Mega Man fans will probably buy Mega Man X7 reguardless of what I written above (I still bought it, and I knew what I was getting into). Still, I remember a time when you could say you had beaten all the Mega Man X games and you could say it with pride. Unfortunately, now all it means you have played four good games and four so-so games.","Messing with a proven formula, Capcom ends up in hot water",1101254400,7,,

Graphics: 5/5 They have really improved the graphics of the old version alot. They aren't those blocky NES graphics, they are fine and colorful. That's what I like about the Mario Franchise.

It seems that EA has figured out that the name Medal of Honor racks up sales.  Well, let's just say that this will change all that as many are already disappointed with Rising Sun.
After playing MOH: Frontline can you blame gamers for expecting a little more frm Rising Sun? No, you can't.  In fact, Rising Sun fails in just about every aspect that Frontline succeeded in.
The most noticeable thing right off the bat are the graphics.  Simple graphics that actually lack a bit of detail.  There is no real detail in most buildings.  But the good news is that the gamespeed isn't slow.  Still, there are points where just a tad bit more detail was needed.
The gameplay is what comes off as a disappointment when compared to Frontline.  Missions in Frontline were very fun to do, but these feel more like a chore.  The missions aren't long and they're simple, thanks to the weak enemy AI.
The AI in this game is terrible.  In Frontline I remember that fighting enemies was a challenge.  I could toss a grenade at a soilder in Frontline and they'd actually pick it up and toss it back!  I knew I wasn't dealing with just any game at that point.  So why can't the soilders do that in this one?  Actually, it gets worse.  If you encounter two troops at once you can actually kill one while the other simpley watches and even reload while you're at it.  Not only that but all troop attack in the same fashion.  They run up to you blindly and ""hope"" to get a shot off.  It takes the fun out of the game when your enemies AI is nothing higher than that of a Goomba in Mario.
The Multiplayer I can't help but admit was a bit of a letdown.  It's nice to play with someone but the fact is, the multiplayer is a little boring.  Missions actually differ depending on whether or not you actually play with two characters at a time. For example, player one will have to help player two advance forward.  This makes the game a little funner but it still makes for an annoyance.
The deathmatch is where the Multiplayer fails to deliever.  It's rather boring to run around looking for your opponent in a rather small map with few weapons to obtain.  It just isn't exciting.  Play other games in a deathmatch and you'll see that Rising Sun is rather boring here.
However, the music and the narrative cutscenes are fascinating.  The game scores high here.  Music is usually good in MOH games and this one doesn't present any really bad music. The historical scenes also have a pretty decent narrator too. So there are lots of secrets to unlock in this game, the questions is are you willing to play for them?
This game is more of a rent only.  It's short and easy and even the secrets can be unlocked rather easily.  You're better off this way.  Rising Sun just can't seem to rise above Frontine.  The sequel comes out next year so let's hope that EA can pull it together and make that one worth a buy!",Rising Sun doesn't Rise above Frontline,1071619200,,,

Prince of Persia 2 - The Shadow and the Flame was bigger, better and the graphics were some of the best at that time. This was also the first time that a narrator that actually SPOKE was used in a game. I still remember my jaw drop when my speakers came to life, putting out more than just generic sound...

In 1997 Prince of Persia 3D was released, an attempt to renew the series by introducing new elements like the third dimension. Let's face it, it wasn't the worst game of all times, but it wasn't really good either. After POP3D it seemed that the legacy had vanished. But (at least some) companies are smarter than actually dropping a promising brand only because there was one unsuccessful title. And so the Prince returned...

Can a game actually be too good to be true? Having played hundreds and hundreds of different games over the years (no I'm not exaggerating, people often DO tell me to get a life though), there was only a handful that overwhelmed me so much that I just couldn't stop playing no matter how late the hour nor the work I should be doing. I heard good things about Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and from the screens and our preview I knew that I could like it, but after completing the game in less than 48 hours I knew that saying ""I liked the game"" would be an understatement. Ladies and gentlemen, dear readers - let me present you my personal console Game of the Year.

Time is like an ocean in a storm. You may wonder who I am, and why I say this; Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard...

This time ""Prince"" ( it is an unwritten law of the series that you never actually learn his name) is actually of noble blood, not a nobody from a distant land that fought his way out of a dark palace dungeon and eventually conquered the heart of the local princess by means of defeating the evil Vizier that threatened her life and the future of her kingdom. ""Prince"" is the son of the king of Persia making him - can you guess it?

Young ""Prince"" accompanies his father to pay a visit to the allied kingdom of Azad, but on their way they are also looking for fame and riches. And so, when the traitorous Vizier of India approaches them, offering that he will open the gates of the capital for them and allow them and their troops to loot the infamous treasure chambers of the Maharaja of India, they both quickly accept. ""Prince"", wanting to prove himself is one of the first to rush into the city's palace grounds. And here our adventure begins.

The prince of graphics

The graphical presentation is one of the best I have ever seen, and I admit that I'm not surprised that the developers stated more than once that this about as much as they can realize in the game, especially on the oldest console among the competition. But if this is the best, I have no problem with more similarly well looking titles coming this way.

Sheer numbers are already a good way of expressing how detailed e.g. the animations and characters are. The prince himself consists of over 1800 polygons and over 750 different animations - way to go, as the original Prince of Persia had a character consisting out of 1 Polygon, with only 100 different animations.

People that fear that - since we spend most of our playing time in a palace again - the levels can become repetitive can relax - the developers had more than one interesting idea. Various tracts of the palace feature different kinds of architecture, giant halls and libraries, baths and underground caves with gigantic waterfalls and stalactites to climb and stalagmites to impale yourself one, many outdoor levels including vast garden areas, a beastarium, and of course the inescapable visit to the dungeons of the palace. Not one place and not one room look the same, and you will never have the feeling that any of the level designers allowed their work to be sloppy.

A symphony of athletics

Finding your way through the besieged city you will learn the basic and most of the advanced moves you are capable off. Besides running, jumping, climbing ladders and of course grapping ledges, our well trained prince is capable of many more things you shouldn't try at home.

First of all he can run up walls. If the top of an obstacle is just out of reach, you can use this ability to gain some extra height and grab the ledge. While still running up the wall (let's call this action ""walling"" from now on - for obvious reasons) you may also decide to jump off the wall, possibly reaching prior unreachable places in mid-air of the now higher and wider jump.",An under-rated classic.,1134259200,3,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'},

In 2003, Ubisoft, developers of the Rayman series and the recent smash hit Splinter Cell franchise, reinvented what had been one of the seminal platformers of the late 80's and early 90's. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a reinvention of the classic series, full of hallmarks of the series; combat, beautiful animation, cunning traps, and daring acrobatics, but with a new set of characters, new story, and brilliant new gameplay mechanics that changed the way platforming could be approached in games.

With the help of Jordan Mechner, the original creator of the Prince of Persia series, Ubisoft spins a tale of a young prince and his first conquest. Eager for honor glory, he accompanies his father to India, where, seeking treasure, they use a traitorous Vizier to infiltrate and decimate a Maharajah's palace. During the raid, the entire palace is ransacked, and the prince and his father sieze the Sands of Time, contained in a bejeweled hourglass, and the Dagger of Time, a weapon of unknown power.

However, the treacherous Vizier, seeking immortality, tricks the Prince into using the Dagger to open the hourglass, setting the Sands of Time loose as a plague upon the palace of Hazad, a once-welcoming place now turned into a death trap full of twisted Sand Creatures, spike pits, whirling blades, and bottomless chasms. With only the Dagger (giving him control over time) and Farah, the daughter of the conquered Maharajah, the Prince must make his way through the sultan's palace and undo what he has done.

The meat and potatoes of Sands of Time is its brilliantly cinematic and acrobatic platforming and puzzle solving, featuring the use of ropes, poles, beams, narrow ledges, and walls that the prince must run along to avoid danger and traverse his environment. Both the level design and the ease of control (even for pulling off the most incredible looking stunts) is leages ahead of other platforming games, and the addition of the sand powers (allowing you to rewind time, slow time, and speed it up) adds a whole new layer to the puzzles. This is enhanced by the game's visuals, which set a bechmark for animation and artistic design, drawing gorgeous vistas and gruesome enemies while never stuttering.

The sand powers are also crucial during the combat portions of the game. During the game, more and stronger enemies will stand between the Prince and redemtion, and he must use the dagger to destroy these monsters, which, in turn, grants him superhuman powers; he can freeze his enemies and slice them to ribbons, slow them to a crawl as he dances around them, and stop time completely to cut a swath through them with ease and grace. The game gives the player a larger number of options in dispatching enemies, though you'll find yourself sticking with a couple strategies for most of the game.

During combat, as well as during the exploration of the sultan's palace, there is a steady stream of banter from the characters. Whether it's simply the prince talking to himself (or to the player, as he tells his story) or the snarky comments he and Farah fire back at each other, it gives the game a great sense of personality. Both of these characters end up having to work together for survival, with Farah slipping through cracks to open doors the prince can't reach, or fire at enemies from a distance as he battles them with sword, and it's great fun to watch their attitudes toward each other gradually change.

The story that unfolds for the player, which uses both of these characters to great effect, is also a treat; it goes a step further than most video game stories, with some great twists along the way, and just the right sense of closure while still leaving room for more. And with the brilliant music and fantastic voice work, it geniunely draws the player into this world of ancient Persia, and makes sure they'll want to hear the story again and again.

With gorgeous visuals, a capturing tale, and plenty of charm, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, is a brilliant action platformer that allows players to do things previously impossible in games, and draws them into a digital world like few other titles can. So come and hear a tale like none you have heard before.",Honor and glory. . .,1133395200,,,

The familiar, fun gameplay is here. You're a kid taking over a farm. The farm is in disrepair and needs help. You start out by weeding the garden, chopping the logs into boards and breaking up rocks. You slowly start growing crops, raising horses and chickens, and making a name for yourself.
You might think this would get boring, but time is running all the time. You have to get food to your animals, play with them, keep your crops watered, get your field cleared, mine for supplies, go into town and chat it up with the local girls.
There are the usual goodies - horse races, other festivals that come on certain days of the year. There are upgrades to your tools and little sprites that help you out with your tasks. You can fall in love with the girl of your dreams and build a life together. With lots of customizable names, from your farm to your dog to your horse, it really begins to feel like your own little world.
The graphics are great, and while it's not a button-mashing extreme, the clock is always ticking so you get a sense that you have to get going with your life in order to feed yourself and your animals. There aren't goals to meet or points to score - there is a farm to tend to and responsibilities to manage. It's a great game for all ages and VERY rewarding.
My one complaint about this game - and keep in mind that this is a HUGELY addictive game for me so I love it - is that it only lets you be a male. Why??

The only draw-back of Disciples is that there are only five races (human, undead, demon, dwarves, and elves).  Warlords have more.

My biggest gripe about Warlords IV is the animation and the graphic; it's really bad.  I suggest you download both demo of Warlords and Disciples and compare the artwork and gameplay.  Another problem is that there are no real resource management... no gold to mine and no mana to collect.  Also, each race has only 6 units!  The human race has the swordman, bowman, knight, siege engine, archon, and a hero.  In comparison, the human race in Disciples has almost 20 different battle units, ranging from assassins to white wizards.

GRAPHICS: Mediocre.  Maybe the Xbox and my PC have spoiled me, but the PS2's graphics are really starting to show their age.  The grainy texture, meant to simulate a video feed, conveniently hides low-res textures and graphics.
SOUND: Good, though I've heard much better.  Splinter Cell (a game after which Manhunt is patterned in many ways) does it MUCH better.
CONTROL: Laborious.  Remember how fights in GTA 3 were somewhat laborious, especially with multiple baddies?  That's Manhunt.  The control is a little better, but still rather stunted and jerky, lacking the precision of Splinter Cell or Metal Gear.  The fights are button mashing affairs, with little difference between the hard and fast strike buttons.
GAMEPLAY: Linear, repetitive and forced.  The game won't let you escape an area without killing, so there goes the stealth aspect.  You MUST gore the hunters in order to proceed.  The weapons vary, but be prepared for drudgery at the lower levels: you have your fists, a shard or a plastic bag.  Again, it's like Splinter Cell without the sense of purpose or mission, as you mindlessly dispatch yet another identical clone on your way to the next level, where you... mindlessly dispatch another identical clone.  The atmosphere is pretty good, though again the control and graphics conspire against this game.  If you want to run around and create havoc, get GTA 3; if you want stealth action, get Splinter Cell.

Second of all, it's quite simply the finest 2d side-scrolling shoot-em-up imaginable.

It takes everything that was good about the Gradius series (excellent powerup system, fantastic artistic direction, music fit for jesus, phenomenal play control) and reworked everything that was bad about the Gradius series.

The cold respawn from past entries is gone (thank god), so now when you die, you respawn right where you were in the level.  You also no longer lose your Options upon death, which is a welcome addition given that the entire game design hinges on having all 4 options.  The hit box has been reduced from entire-friggin'-ship to more of a Treasure/Cave/Milestone style, tiny-box-in-center hitbox, allowing much more bullet clutter and difficulty without being unfair.

The level design is stupendous.  By halfway through the second level, you'll probably be saying ""wow, what else could their be?""...then level 3 hits you with vertically-oriented boss.  Then stage 4 hits you with the hardest incarnation of the inside-alien-living-level of any of the Gradius games and it only gets worse/more fun :).

Suffice to say, it's a masterpiece in 2d gaming and is a must-have for anyone with a PS2, whether you like this style of game or not.  It's that good.

For those familiar with the series, powerups are selected a-la old-Gradius, with a individual selection a-la Gradius 3 option popping up once you've made it through all 8 stages.  The second stage features a end-of-stage-7-in-Gradius-3 style serial-bosses situation, complete with a few classic bosses from G3.

Buy this game.  Seriously.  And get Gradius Collection for PSP and realize how far the series has come! (And how much easier SNES Gradius 3 was than ARC Gradius 3...game still gives me nightmares!)",Sidescrolling shooting bliss,1241136000,,,

Great signal when I'm downstairs and at least 20 feet from my Netgear router, but when I take it upstairs it obtains and drops the signal on an almost second by second basis. I'm sure it works fine with a wireless router across the room from it, but don't get your hopes up if you're going the distance.

Setup can be a pain. Some kind of reset voodoo has to happen to it when you press the reset button to get it to default settings so you can access it with the setup software. But once you get it set every profile to the same SSID and related info. Seems if profile 1 won't work the others might. And the profiles are represented on the unit as P1, P2 and P3. There are ad-hoc settings on a straight channel basis. They call it ""Head to Head."" As I don't have another Xbox 360 and another unit here to test it I'm figuring it works as expected with the advertised ""0 configuration.""

Oh! And here's something I found out while fiddling with a Linksys wired router and this thing. When plugged into one of the 4 access ports on a router it acts as a wireless bridge to whatever else is plugged into the other 3 ports. No connection to a cable modem necessary. Of course this means you need a wireless router already connected to the cable modem. But!

PS2 vs. Gamecube

The PS2 obliterates this system on nearly every level. The PS2 has online and CD/DVD player capabilities that the Gamecube lacks entirely. The graphics are about the same between the two with maybe a slight edge to the cube. Also the cube is slightly cheaper. The library is close but I will have to give this to PS2.  While cube has all the nintendo staples (Mario, Zelda, Metroid, DK, SSB, etc), the sony system comes out on top with innovative and outstanding titles (GTA, Metal Gear, Final Fantasy, Jak, R & C, SOCOM, etc.) Also the PS2 outshines GC in the sheer number of titles. While the cube controller beats the XBOX in overall comfort, the dualshock 2's button layout is nearly flawless and feels just right. Overall, the cube is a competent if basic system that sells because of  the classic Nintendo series.

PS2 vs. XBOX

While this one is closer than the previous, the PS2 still triumphs. XBOX and PS2 have similar features: DVD/CD and online but the XBOX simultaneously one ups and ""one downs"" (if that's a phrase) the PS2. The improvement lies in the ability to save directly on to the system on its HDD and more specifically burn songs onto it to use with your games. However, the monthly fee to play online is a major setback for any consumer. Onto the graphics, this is the one category PS2 falters in. The XBOX's graphics are decidedly better overall. PS2 makes a comeback in the controller department. Even with the S-controller, XBOX's controller takes a while to get used to, is overly bulky, and has a strange button layout. This just cant compete with the PS2's far superior controller. It is easy to use and the perfect size. Onto the game library. This is probably the most debated part of a PS2/XBOX comparison. While the PS2 has all the strong titles I mentioned above, the XBOX has powerful exclusives as well (Ninja Gaiden, Chronicles of Riddick, and the almighty HALO 1 and 2). In my opinion, Halo is a fantastic game yet not as amazing as people make it out to be. It is a marvelous FPS but is definitely the most overrated game in recent memory. The PS2 wins because these previous four titles and good graphics are the only reasons to buy an XBOX. If you take away these 3 the rest of the exclusives pretty much suck. All you are left with is the multiplatform games which you could get on your PS2 and have the advantage of free online and a much better controller. Overall, XBOX has pretty graphics and HALO thats it, period.

That being said, I think this new edition was great! I originally came to want this because I couldn't handle the stress and paranoia in games like Silent Hill. I figured it would be nice to have a game more oriented with a decent flow of action rather than chop-chop-chop run for the hills, keep running for ten minutes, look for scary things in the fog, now find an item. It was disappointing, and I was getting just too paranoid with games like SH.

The only issue I have that I haven't really seen in any other game is the fact that cutscenes and even mini-cutscenes(the ones that heighten model detail a little as opposed to alot) need a loading screen before they are shown, which can hinder online play a little since most players will skip them. If you've played a game on a next-gen console like PS2, you know that most cutscenes are integrated with gameplay so there is a smooth transition. Oh well, I got used to it, so can you.

One other thing I'm not satisfied with, however, is the fact that the servers won't let you play online if you're profile doesnt show you as 17 or older, which I find totally pointless. If you're playing the game in Single player, they shouldn't hold the right to restrict you from playing on the Network. Forgive my critique on today's discipline methods, but that's what parenting is about people. Leave it to the parents, Capcom!

Now if you want to get to the root of Outbreak, I'd give you this advice: Outbreak is the game you want to buy if you play games to beat them. Outbreak has episodes and a decent storyline, but it seems like it's more geared toward beating levels, gaining points, and spending them on extras. Extras and cheat costumes are also achieved by completing in-game scenarios and grabbing special items. So I just feel like you may enjoy the storyline, but it really seems like it's more about the gaming part of the game than anything, which is great in a sense because you can get up to 3 people to help you do just that!","Fun, dark, and I'm satisfied.",1101081600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
3,False,"07 26, 2004",A1LVMQ52YODRMO,B0000V48MA,sporkdude,"Well, I was weary of this game because it's licensed, it's licensed for a series of Transformers cartoons that I have never seen, and it's by Atari. I basically had a free rental and this was the only thing that caught my eye. You know what, despite all that - it turned out to be pretty good.

 My main gripe is that it's not based on the original Transformers (mid 80s) series, which is really the only Transformers series around in my opinion. Being based on Armada, the only characters that I recognized and that transformed to the same vehicle were Starscream and Optimus Prime. The fans of the mid 80s show are in their twenties now, with tons of disposable income. Where the heck is a decent game for that?

 Anyway, it turned out to be pretty good. It's a third person shooter basically. You can change into a car, but it's really useless because of the terrain, so the expected blend of driving and third person shooter is really not there. There are about 7 short levels (2 jungles, 2 snow based, 1 outer space, 1 island based, and 1 ship based) that are mostly done linearly, but you can comeback to earlier ones to collect Datacons and Minicons. Datacons unlock extras (movies, etc.), while Minicons are little robots that give a certain power, whether it be extra shielding, regeneration, better weapons or something else. Searching for Minicons can be annoying (I started using a guide in about the second level and beyond), but are worth it because of the improved weaponry. Most of these are optional, but rewards the extra time to find them.

 There are three difficulty settings and you can play as three different autobots at almost any time (Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, Red Alert). I found the easiest level to be somewhat challenging, especially some of the bosses, so I never ventured into the higher difficulty settings. Constant save points are littered throughout each level, so you'll find yourself rarely repeating fights.

 The good thing about this game was that I couldn't put it down. I was out one day, and all I could think about was coming back home and destroying Megatron. Even though not spectacular, this game really grabs you. The Minicons add a new dimension to a very standard game, and CGI movies are pretty polished as well. Finally, I got to play Optimus Prime. How cool is that?

 Now to the bad. The graphics are typical of early PS2 games, and the controls seem kind of jerky. With modern shooters (like TimeSplitters 2 or James Bond's latest), it seems kind of dated. The fact that there really is no driving in the game kind of defeats the purpose of ""transforming."" I was pretty frustrated on the second level in easy mode. They could have made a tad easier.

 All in all, if you're an Armada fan, this is a great game. If you're not, you'll still find it to be decent.

 Pros:

 In the end, I could not put it down.

 Optimus Prime!

 Minicons enhance abilities.

 Numerous save points.

 Cons:

 It's not the ""real"" Transformers, so not as fun.

 Graphics are subpar.

 Pretty difficult in the beginner level.

 Hardly ever use the automobile.

 Controls are kind of clunky.

Listen up, I REALLY wanted to like this game, and it is fun, some of the time. Theres some things on this game that you cant do anywhere else which makes it really exciting. And when you play it with a friend its way cool. Mostly because the biggest attraction of this game is its big plays. It seems every other down theres a big big play, which is very fun when your playing with a friend because it makes the game exciting. But when you are playing one player it gets a little tough...How do I put this? Well consider this, Ive been playing it for about a week and im already going bald from the frustration. This game is very very frustrating. Appearently EA Sports BIG was getting complaints about NBA Street 2 being too easy because this game is HARD. First of all when you start out in the singleplayer mode ""NFL Challenge"" you get a group of runts that have no talent whatsoever. Recievers don't catch, defenders don't tackle. Its pretty much a blowout everytime you try to play a pro team in a game. But after a while you accumluate development points and yout players get better. Your still not able to stop anyone on defense but you can score pretty much without trying. Soon you atart beating down the CPU pretty good, but theres a problem, and its one of the dumbest rules ive ever seen on a sports game: AUTO-CPU ASSIST. Thats right now no matter how good you are doing the computer has a backup plan, the computer assistance. Soon the other team will make play after play scoring on one play at times putting points on the board mighty fast. Meanwhile defensively they will crush you. Not only will it be impossible to make a big play but everyother pass is intercepted, anytime you are tackled you lose the ball on a fumble, its ridiculous. In games to 36 ive had 35-6 leads decimate to 41-22 nail biters. The computer will score on offense and defense again and again, all because of the CPU assistance that they so ingeniusly made automatic in challenge games. Its ridiculous and unfair.
In conclusion you will have a lot of fun playing this game, as long as you can handle the teeth clenching frustration you will get again and again trying to compete in such unfair circumstances. The NFL Street idea was a good one, but the way they out it together needs to be completely rethought.

The graphics are excellent. The AI is pretty respectable and the gore and effects are beyond belief but not gratuitous. The weapons are slick and the limitation of carrying only 3 leaves you making decisions along the way that affect outcome and ability. There were usually multiple ways of attacking an area if you explored which made for a great strategy angle missing from most shooters. The ability to change difficulty mid-game was a great idea.

They tried to build the story up too much, too shrouded in mystery with many loose ends and incomplete characters. What was with all the answering machine messages? They did nothing for me.

The music is absolutely gorgeous. There's 3 acts in every world and all of them have different music. I also love the colorful graphics.

If you liked the first one there is nothing about Pandora that will disappoint.  It exceeds the original in almost every category.

There are a few new moves in this outing.  They are easy to learn and incorporate if you are already accustomed to the first game.  If you have not played the first SC, then you will have a much higher learning curve.  I would also recommend playing the original first, as it is extremely cheap right now and very fun.  The original will hone your skills for taking Pandora on.

Pandora bests the original in graphics and also corrects some strange behaviors that were in place in the original game.  The most noticeable is the absence of bullet-proof light bulbs.  My friends and I use to have fun pointing out that flaw in the original.  We would joke around about how terrorists shouldn't be in it for the money if they had enough to install so many bullet-proof lightbulbs.  We would also go on about ""boo-let-pruf-leit-bulbs"" in thick russian accents - good times.  So far all light-bulbs in this game are breakable.  I still do not understand why there is no option to simply unscrew a lightbulb.  You still have to waste a bullet (or find a throwable glass bottle) to create some cover of darkness.

A new welcome feature in Pandora is the quicksave/load.  I played the original on the X-box, so this might not be new in the PC versions.  I don't know how many times I had to execute a sequence of events that took 15 minutes just so I could mess up time and time again at some difficult spot right before the checkpoint.  No such headache here.

A few new improvements include an indicator that tells you exactly how many times you can be spotted before the mission is compromised and an indicator that tells you when bodies are sufficiently hidden.

The graphics were fantastic, the sound effects were phenomenal (with surround sound), and the performance was excellent.  The weapon selections are cool and the combat system is innovative (the dead-eye and showdown features are great: cue old west music and quick-draw movie cut).  Those were the game's strongest points by far.

The weak spots had to do with the storyline and gameplay.  The story, by itself, was excellent and well-written but its execution was sadly lacking.  The game is 100% linear with absolutely no choice in course of action or deviation.  Even character choice is up to the story and not the player - you'll use different characters, both good and bad, throughout the game.  Totally linear gameplay really bugs me.  I finished the game just to finish it - but halfway through the game it was apparent that the gameplay was poorly implemented.

If you like a game with some good action and fun combat sequences that you'll have no problem with this game - even the story is okay to watch.

If you are looking for a solid western ""shoot em up"" game, then you should enjoy Red Dead Revolver.  You play (mainly) as Red, a quiet yet lethal gunfighter whose family was slaughtered in front of him.  Basically his father had married an Indian girl, and the rest of the white folk didn't like this too much.  So, Red sets out to avenge the deaths of his parents (sound familiar).
You make your way through different ""scenes"" and encounter different characters, although none of them really stand out.  There is a lot of gunfighting, at times it seems even the most trivial little thing will lead to a battle.  The fights are strung together by little movie scenes that progress the storyline of the game.  As the game wore on, I found myself hitting the ""X"" button everytime a scene started to play out.  In other words, the story failed to keep my attention.
The controls are somewhat awkward, as are the camera views/perspective.  You control which way Red is facing with the right analog stick and make him run in that direction with the left stick.  This can be tricky and sluggish; at times an enemy will be blowing you away from just a couple feet off, but you can't change Red's direction and position fast enough to kill him.  So you end up almost dying.  Also, gunfighting can be a pain due to the odd control scheme; this takes time to get wired and even then you will find yourself getting crazy since the controls are not intuitive.  That type of thing is frustrating but overall the game has more strong points than problems.  The graphics are pretty good, lots of gritty western backdrops, tumbleweeds, saloons, etc. The whole thing moves along pretty quickly as far as load times go.  You can buy different weapons and supplies throughout the game as well.
Overall I would recommend this game.  50 bucks is too much but hey just my opinion.  The fact that there aren't any other western cowboy games on the market makes this one that much more appealing anyway.

CONCEPT: Lead a 4-man CT (counter-terrorism) team in a variety of missions, including sweep and clear, bomb disposal, and hostage rescue, with a WIDE selection of weapons and gear to assist you.
GRAPHICS: Weapon detail is excellent. You can actually ""see"" the ""correct"" way to reload the various rifles and pistols in the game. The night and thermal vision modes look very sweet and are actually very useful. Environments are great as well, although tangos look a bit redundant after a while (they either wear leisure suits or Hawaiian shirts. Kinda like blowing away John Travolta or Jimmy Buffett...).
SOUND: The weapon's sounds are very authentic. You can tell the difference between an M-4 and an AK-47, as well as the other weapons. Radio chatter amongst teammates is also a tad repetitive, as is tango voices (both living and dying). However, a nice feature is the ability to hear radio chatter only through the headset, which adds to the ambiance and realism (especially when playing alone). Environmental sounds are also very realistic.
CONTROLS: Not bad. Tends to be a bit frustrating at first, but you get the hang of it very quickly. Issueing team commands is good either with or without the headset, although without is a bit easier.
OVERALL: A good, solid combat/tactical sim worthy of the ""Tom Clancy"" title. I think that there are a few issues here and there, like not being able to pick your teammate's weapons and gear, or the sometimes dumb mistakes your teammates can make resulting in their injury or demise. Also, it would have been nice to be able to pick your team from a wider pool of operatives (like the PC versions). If you like this type of game, you will not be disappointed. Replay value is good, as trying missions over again with new weapons and tactics is a blast. Military/weapons buffs (like me) will enjoy the realism and there is no shortage of action for the the shooter-game junkies. OK. This concludes my pre-op briefing. Any questions? No?

4,False,"01 13, 2005",A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B0001I9YHG,Review Lover,"'X-Men Legends' is the first truly good X-Adventure game to be released anywhere - bar, of course, the original X-Men arcade cabinet from the eighties.

For too long have we suffered the mediocre (X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse on the SNES, X2 - Wolverine's Revenge on PS 2) and the downright ugly (Spider-Man & X-Men on Genesis, X-Men: Mojo World on Game Gear) excesses of cheap-games-produced-by-license, promising all manner of X-Goodness and then failing utterly to live up to the coolness and depth of storyline that have made the comic books such a strong feature of popular culture for the past half-a-century.

There have been some great beat-'em-ups, sure, but adventuring is what the X-Men are all about, and happily, 'XML' turns the tables and delivers adventure action in spades, with a hefty dose of characterisation and one of the best storylines ever.

GRAPHICS: 3

Decent enough, the cel-shaded look is nice and colorful, but the camera angles mean that you never see much detail. Backdrops are big and nicely detailed (the NYC and Astral Plane levels are particularly cool) and presentation is excellent (loading screens are beautiful to look at, menus are nice and responsive) but one can't help feeling that the PS 2 is capable of far more.

SOUND: 4

Excellent voice acting adds to a wonderful atmosphere that is hampered only by repetitive in-game battle music. Excellent sound effects and the option to skip over the longer monologues is a nice touch.

PLAYABILITY: 4

The controls are very responsive and, though detailed enough as to be complex, are by no means hard to learn. The learning curve is steep, but the intro levels with Wolverine, Cyclops and Magma are more than enough to familiarise yourself with tactics and motion. The Danger Room scenarios, accessible at any time, are great, too - becuase health items are very scarce in the earlier levels. The lack of interaction or a true RPG element is also somewhat annoying - how much cooler would a Final Fantasy-style X-Game with realtime combat have been??

ATMOSPHERE: 3

Although this is an X-Men adventure in the true mold, there are one or two things that detract from the atmosphere. Loading Screens, though pretty to look at, and very varied, cannot mask the fact that Loading Times in-game are insufferably long, and changing teams mid-mission becomes a huge chore. Similarly grating is the difficulty level of some of the later missions, and the price of resurrecting fallen teammates is disproportionately large, meaning you may find yourself going up against the final bosses with a handful of the more useless characters - Rogue, Gambit, Beast, Jubilee, etc.

However, for every bad point here there's two good ones to take its place, and I defy all but the most finnicky of X-Purists to find something that actually ruins their enjoyment of the game.

LASTING FACTOR: 4

Levelling your individual teammates up as you see fit is a nice touch; powers become unlocked as you want them. Secret items and costumes are a great touch, and become available after you finish the game, which is nice and long. But two plays through this excellent adventure will leave you having seen everything - there's only a finite number of things to do and see.

OVERALL:

A truly great adventure game that loses its fifth star becuase of a few annoying gameplay quirks (loading times, a general feeling of 'on-rails', unfairly expensive items), 'X-Men Legends' is still a thoroughly recommended way to spend forty bucks.

3,False,"01 20, 2005",A3SHUFLRYND1NG,B0001NJHH8,Jonathan S.,"This game is a bizarre mixture of great and terrible gamemaking that could have been a great game.

Graphics: An odd mixture of low poly counts, cartoonish character design, and beautiful Source engine textures and effects. You can see the Source engine in this game, but don't expect it to look quite as good as Half-Life 2.

Story: A good, deep storyline, with secrets planted everywhere imaginable in the game world. My only complaint here is that the writing and characters are sometimes cheesy to the point of laughter. Also, not recommended for people who are easily driven crazy by goth trends and scenesters.

Gameplay: A great balance of stealth, subterfuge, diplomacy and combat where no particular tactic is overpowered. The only limiting factor in how you play the game is there are lots of incentives for making friends and contacts, so you can't be a purely selfish and threatening character and you sometimes have to cooperate with dorky NPCs. Still, the balance and diversity of the gameplay is probably the high point of the game. The combat, which is done in a tactical style where your aim and damage are effected by your skills, is nothing special, but it works.

Physics: I've seen a few neat tricks employed, but some of the Havok physics implementation is just sad. Certain objects are pretty laid back and don't really mind floating off in a random direction when bumped. Others are more affectionate and like sticking to my characters' foot. Again, the Source engine is evident, but don't expect it to work flawlessly like it did in Half-Life 2.

I would be inclined to give this a 4, especially in light of the fact that the game lets you run around beating people to death with a severed arm. Unfortunately, there are massive technical problems out of the box. Half the time I played it pre-patched, radical memory leaks crashed my computer when I quit. I haven't played a game that messed with my computer this much in at least 2 years.

If you're not a big fan of the Vampire: the Masquerade pen-and-paper roleplaying game, you will still probably have some fun with this, but there are better games out.",A very mixed bag,1106179200,3,,
5,False,"12 17, 2012",A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B0001OK7VW,Arch Stanton,"This is one of those games that I wish I could have played as a kid. It has it all: a good story, great characters, and a beautifully designed world. Mostly it's the characters that draw me in. Lloyd is the main character and he's kind of an idiot. He's always getting really obvious things wrong and always needing basic things explained (which is great from a storytelling perspective). Genis is his best friend and an elf. He's just a sweet innocent kid, but put the two of them together and comedy is bound to ensue. Raine is Genis' big sister and the schoolteacher. She has a teeensy little obsession with archaeology that has inspired my friends' battle-cry ""For History!"" Then there's the romantic interest: Collette, the chosen one who is destined to become an angel and regenerate the world. For the world is dying and the last chosen of regeneration failed, leaving Collette with a lot to live up to. She avoids the typical chosen one cliches by being quite a ditz and having a real propensity for being kidnapped. The final character (for quite a while at least) is Kratos, the stereotypical powerful samurai-type character who says little at all times. I love these characters, right down to their names. Genis was called Genius in Japan and lives up to his name as does the ruined city of Luin (Ruin in Japan), Kratos is Ancient Greek for strength, and Lloyd is... um, probably Mongolian for a stupid person or something. The enemies in the game are an organization of half elves who are intent on farming humans for a reason as yet unclear.

Gameplaywise this game is excellent. Instead of the turn based combat common in most RPGs of this age it features real time combat. Actually, the combat system on here is quite hard and I almost gave up due to the difficulty of the bosses. This isn't a game for those without good abilities monitoring multiple characters. Random battles are avoided in place of visible enemies on the world map. You can't avoid all of them, but it does at least allow you to limit the number you encounter. The design for the towns (while simplistic) is quite well done. Copying Wind Waker everything in the game is cell shaded to give it the look of a cartoon. They even have anime cutscenes, albeit all too rarely. This makes the game quite beautiful and gives it a real sense of style. At various points in the game you will see a little text pop up and if you hit Z then you can watch a short conversation between a few of your characters. These are short, often funny, and contribute nothing to the plot. They are however great for character moments. They're some of the most entertaining parts of the game.

It does have to be said that this game runs a little long. And there are story problems too, which are exacerbated by the length. Any game where there are half a dozen characters on your side who could have told you the entire plot at any point but don't, and where the main characters don't think to pose even basic questions is bound to seem annoyingly artificial at times. It should probably have ended a good ten hours before it does. The story is ridiculously complex with character motivations and plot points coming out of seemingly nowhere. Some of these are really good, but some are quite odd as well as being needlessly convoluted and unclear (I'm thinking of a certain tree in particular). But nevertheless the game does an admirable job at fleshing out an entire world that feels very real and complex.

So to conclude: Excellent game with great characters and a fun plot but too difficult in some areas and starts to drag by the end. Hopefully you can work your way through the problems because these are some truly wonderful characters. Admittedly there are two or three I don't care about, but the rest I absolutely love and I never got tired of watching their interactions.

My favorite thing about it is the graphics, especially inside the towns, where I can really imagine being in medieval England (the story is set on another planet, but it resembles most people's idea of medieval England). I enjoy creating multiple characters and taking them down different paths. Some of the quests are fun.

One thing about it that's good and bad both, this game is REALLY REALLY easy. Unlike, say, PSO, where it might take months to beat the whole game, I can beat Fable in three hours if I don't do any side quests, or 12 hours if I do every single side quest I can find. All you have to do is get Physical Shield and Enflame, master the Card Sorting game in Bowerstone South, stock up on Will Potions, and you will level up so fast that combat is really never an issue. Whether this is good or bad depends on whether you want to be challenged or whether you just want to go in and blow things up.

I find the stats, such as ""best chicken kick"" and ""number of times had sex,"" to be fun and amusing.

My least favorite thing about the game is how hard it is to be evil. Stealing 3 tattoo cards from someone's bookshelf carries the same number of evil points as MURDERING someone, for crying out loud. Even sacrificing innocent people to the evil god only gets you 40 or so evil points. I sacrificed 4 people the other day and still came out with ""good"" alignment. Hello?!? These folks are far too forgiving of misdeeds. Stealing and occasionally committing random acts of violence can be fun, but being evil enough for horns and flies is boring, and disturbing too if you have a conscience.

I would say that the game itself is kind of boring; however, I have wasted about a month of my life creating new characters and playing them in different ways, so it must have [...] me in somehow. It's pretty fun, actually.",Nice graphics,1127260800,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

Everything from the previous titles has been upgraded for this incarnation. The weapons, graphics, customization, missions, story, vehicles, mood, .......everything..... But easily the most impressive thing about this game is the breathtakingly huge game world this takes place in. The game is divided into 3 cities and you start in the Los Angeles-esque Los Santos. When I first loaded up the game, I didn't worry about the missions and just began to explore. I could not believe how big Los Santos alone was. It seemed to be bigger than the entire environments in both GTA3 and GTA Vice City. This is the only game I have ever played were you can simply drive around the game world with the (awesome) radio music blasting and have an amazing experience. This simple exploration factor is more enthralling than entire games I have played. This game is truly more of an experience that must be tried rather than a game.

I expected to see some of the same environments I had seen before after a while but the expansive world of this game just kept continuing.

I guess I should elaborate since I do have 1000 words to work with, but the basic point is this controller is awesome.  If you're like many people and wanted a wireless controller for your PS2 but were scared of the brick and a half sized previous Logitech controller, fear not.  This is the smaller, cheaper, and better little brother of the monster wireless.
It's VERY comfortable.  I'd almost say I enjoy it more than the original.  While it's basically identical in size, I prefer the curves a bit more to the PS2's original harder angles.  If you have some kind of silly infatuation with the Dual Shock though, it's not like you will be let down, it's a very small deviation from the standard.
And for the first time that I've experienced with a third party controller, this thing doesn't feel like plastic you'd find in most dollar-store products.  It's sturdy, has weight, and the sticks and buttons feel awesome.  Sticks are SLIGHTLY less rigid than the DS2, but they're more firm than the DS1 if that helps.
After 2 weeks my batteries with rumble are still working just fine, so it's not like after 10 hours this thing's asking for more juice.
Just buy this thing already, you shouldn't even be reading this far.  It's the best wireless controller EVER.  Yes, even better than the Wavebird since they didn't skimp on the two-way transmission - meaning this controller has rumble (don't buy Nintendo's BS about battery life, they just made it transmit one-way).  Rumble is good, it passed the rez test.
D-pad is kinda disc shaped but strangely it works VERY well.  If the original DS2 D-pad was 100, I'd give this in the 90s easily, which is about 50 points higher than any other 3rd party D-pad.
Like most of logitech's products, it's even licensed by Sony.  But that's sony, they're followers, not leaders, though we never should've been without good wireless for this long.","Best wireless controller EVER.  Heck, best PS2 controller.",1085616000,,,
5,False,"03 29, 2014",AD81H63G30R01,B0001WN0VI,Bambi L. Tuckey,"When I bought this game, it was a bit of a wild ride. I had originally purchased Inuyasha Feudal Combat for the PS2. When it arrived, it had the Feudal combat case but the disc inside was this game, Inuyasha Secret of the Cursed mask. At first I was angry at the seller for making the mistake but before I complained I decided to put it in and give it a try.

And now I am more than happy that the seller made the mistake!!! This game is amazing in a million ways! One, you can play as yourself and interact with all your favorite characters from the anime.

You can bond and form friendships with Kagome, Inuyasha, Sango, Miroku, Shippo or Sesshomaru. You play as a girl (or boy) who ended up stuck in the Feudal Era and now you're the newest companion of Inuyasha's group.

You have powers of Shikigamae (I think that's how its spelled) which is I guess in the spiritual category of powers and abilities. Throughout the game, which is very long, you travel with Inuyasha and his friend. You'll do ALOT of battling, where you can choose the attacks for each character.

Although the game is mostly formed as Chibi CG, where they are CGish but are also on the chibi side to, there are scenes that will turn into anime and look just like the show. During battle sequences when two characters combined an attack, the prologue and epilogue and also some additional scenes of bonding between the characters.

In the game you face Naraku but also a new enemy, you can travel throughout the entire era and even meet side characters like Koga, Rin, Kohaku and Kaede as well as interact with them.

Since you do alot of battling in the game, after certain final battles you and the characters will take a day off to spend time relaxing and bonding.

Your character (You) can spend time with all of them, but whichever character you spend time with the most is the one you'll bond the strongest friendship with. I had bonded strongest with Kagome and Sango, thankfully there are around 10 save files so you can get enough tries to bond with all the characters if you want.

Also on two special times in the game you will have a moment to prove your loyalty to your closest companion, first when you and your companion has to fight a demon when your companion is ill and then again you must make a daring choice when your friend gets injured and Naraku's servants come to attack.

If you love to battle in games alot but also enjoy roleplaying games, then this is the Inuyasha game for you.","Got this by accident, no regrets",1396051200,,,

3,False,"11 18, 2004",APZC5PRJVM0PY,B0001XMA6I,JD,"Overall, this game is a lot of fun (for a First-person-shooter) and I found myself playing it a lot, but it is not without its flaws.  Some are simple graphics glitches (missing shots, paper walls, etc) but some of the others are more frustrating, primarily the horrible, horrible AI and the fact that the Install is the worst I have ever seen.  The pro's do make up for the con's if you can actually get the game to install, but I would't spend $50 on this title - not in its current state.

The GOOD:

 - There is a good assortment of player types to play (sniper, assault, demolitions [rocket launcher], jet-pack, etc) on many different teams (Droids, Rebellion, Imperial, Gungan, Ewok and Wookie, although they are not always available to the player.

 - Each player type has its own unique weapons with their own charachteristics, sounds, model and functionality.

 - Each map is large enough to be accomadating, but the spawn locations aren't always the best, and they aren't large enough to make good use of air units.

 - The maps are unique, some with rain, some with wind, some desert, some ice, some day and some night, each one exciting.

 - The maps are semi-detailed, enough so to add to the flavor, but simple enough to be easy on graphics cards and to avoid any confusion (you won't find yourself getting lost).

 - You have active radar constantly that shows your controlled points, and some enemy/allies movements, but not all.

The BAD:

 - The game lacks that polished feeling we've come to expect, simply put, there are too many inconsitencies and glitches for a final product, especially given its price.

 - As others have mentioned, the weapons seem to lack accuracy at times, as well as lacking substance (but then again, we are talking lasers here, not chunks of lead propelled by explosions of gunfire).

 - The Sniper rifle is not powerful enough, especially the fact that a headshot doesn't do more damage than a torso shot - or a toe shot for that matter.  The splash damage from a rocket launcher is also non-existant.  On the same note, there is no loss of accuracy over range which is a good thing in game terms but hurts realism.

 - The game is practically a commerical mod for BF1942 so shouldn't be so expensive.

 - Felt dated as soon as it hit the shelves - not up to par.

 - There are some moments when the pull on your system resources (primarily video) isn't justified by what you are seeing on the screen - the graphics aren't as good as they should be.

The UGLY:

 - Installing this game is a nightmare.  I'm still having problems and several other reviewers as well.  If you read the online forums you will note that a lot of professional reviewers have also experienced installation hang ups.  Honestly, if the headline reviewers aren't getting working copies it doesn't say much for the software.  In my case, one machine installed flawlessly, but the install was horribly slow - longer than Doom 3 and longer even than UT2004.  On a second machine (similiar in design to the first) the CD's aren't recognizeable (in either drive, one a burner, one a basic CD) and I either get read/write errors or fatal errors that terminate setup and ultimately crash the drive and the computer.  However, if I install from the same disks on other computers I can get them to install 4 out of 5 times.

 - The AI is absolutely some of the worst I have seen.  The enemy AI isn't good, but that of your allies is lousy and works to your detriment.  In fact, if you could keep your allies from spawning, you would find the game that much easier going it alone.  Your allies will blow themselves up with grenades and will blow you up with grenades - a lot! They will shoot you in the back and also jump out in front of you when you are firing - a lot! They will assault Droidekas with their shields up and die by the scores.  It never seems to dawn on them that blasters won't penetrate the shields of the droideka or the armor of the vehicles, but they keep trying until they have run you out of spawns.  Your allies will assault vehicles and turrets with their blasters and give no thought to cover, retreat, flanking or anything save frontal assaults.  They will stand under your own vehicles, forcing you to crush them if you want to move, and they will not man the extra guns in the vehilces if you are the pilot.  When I took over command of a drop ship for example, I even had two gunners on the sides but they never opened fire that I could see...why not?  They employee no strategy whatsover - rush and die, spawn, rush and die again.  Occasionally, they will wait to form a group of 6 or 8, but then they simply run in front of a turret or the enemy throws a grenade in the middle and they ALL die and you are down that many spawns.

In closing, if you can get the game to install (and that is a scary ""if"") you will find it frustrating, less than fulfilling, but ultimately fun in its simplicity.  The game is especially recommended to Star Wars enthusiats (though they may inevitably question some of the finer details of the game, such as the sound of the blasters).  However, I would NOT pay retail for this product, and I feel it should not have retailed for as much in the first place.

With the exception of Halo, Republic Commando is the most modern feeling FPS of the last generation. Its hard to describe but many older FPS games have a strange grid based aiming system. It made it difficult to be precise, and felt really cheap. Especially after playing modern FPS games which almost always have good controls. Almost. Republic commando avoids this flaw by using a smart aiming system that locks onto enemies while you attack them. Instead of a punch or rifle smack attack, your melee attack is a metal cutter that pops out of your wrist.

Aside from its fluid controls, its graphics are pretty good too, once again considering the time period it came out during as it doesn't hold a candle to modern game. The effects are cool, but to be honest the locals are kind of bland. most of the character models are very cool though. They're aren't pretty by today's standards but they are unique and detailed all the same. This is especially present on the battle droids, who begin to fall apart after they take enough damage. Chipping off the face of a super battle droid with your metal cutter is very satisfying, and looks really cool. In my humble opinion its the best looking character damage system in any game.

The story while there, is nothing to write home about. Its pretty lame actually, and the dialogue for the Commandos is far more interesting then the actual mission they're on. There are however a few interesting things that happen towards the end.

4,False,"11 4, 2004",A1T3CTSM0B3IZA,B00020LZAW,Robb Boutros,"I first heard about Killzone about a year ago. The game (originally called Kin) was being developed by the Dutch programming team called Guerrilla Games. The game had been in development for over 4 years. And now after what seemed like an eternity, Killzone has arrived. The result is a very good game, with a few problems.

In Killzone you are one of four ISA soldiers attempting to fend off an assault by the Helghast. The Helghast are a splinter faction of an Earth colony who have become hardened by harsh conditions on thier newley settled planet. The Helghast army then launches a war of agression on the ISA forces.

The first thing that strikes you about this game are it's visuals. It truley is a visually stunning game. The opening cutscene shows you immediatley that this game was meticulously engineered. There's alot of attention to detail. Eventhough Killzone is set in the not too distant future (approximatley 100 years or so) it's not outrageously futuristic. Many locations and buildings have a very modern feel to them. There are a few graphical glitches here and there. The framerate does drop off slightly and there are some issues with some event triggers. One of the other problems is the enemy A.I. is prone to bouts of what I'd call ""vapor lock"". At times the Helghast will stand around waiting for an event trigger. A few shots will get thier attention. What I also like is the character design of the Helghast. They are very reminiscent of the soldiers in the anime film Jin Roh. The game's sound is also very good. ISA and Helghast weapons have very distinct sounds to them. Also the Helghast will curse you as they try to take you down. There's also shattering glass, footsteps changing on various surfaces. This is a good sounding game.

The gameplay is rather good. The game is a first person shooter but the action never really descends into a static pattern of ""walk, shoot, reload, flip lever, crouch"". The missions are very linear in nature. Then again what first person shooter isn't? There are different mission objectives and the Helghast are very tactical in nature. There are times where you'll be pinned down and have to find cover. The Helghast are no easy win. They will fight fiercely and often regroup and take cover. The various environments (ranging from jungles to city streets) provide alot of cover for your squadmates. After a few missions you are joined by 3 other playable characters. Although you are part of a squad, this game is not Rainbow Six or SOCOM. Your squad does back you up, but they aren't commandable. The playable characters range in skills and use of weapons. Luger is the stealth specialist, Templar is the jack of all trades. Rico is the heavy weapons man. And Hakaha is the spy. The controls also vary for each character. Luger is more agile while Rico is slow and plodding. The controls are also laid out very well. You won't find yourself fumbling for any buttons. The learning curve I'd say is about 45 minutes.

With no Network Adaptor I was unable to try the online modes. There are however several different offline ""Battlefield"" modes. These modes range from Assault to Deathmatch, using computer controlled A.I. teammates and enemeys. The offline modes are surpisingly fun as well. There are also a few ""Extras"". War Scenes will show you a game environment with the Helghast and ISA fighting it out. The game trailer is included as well as the opening intro so you can play it at any time you like.

So, now you're probably saying ""Yeah but I heard this game was supposed to be as good as Halo"". Well, I really didn't like Halo. So I can't compare Killzone to it. And I'd suggest that you don't either (if anything this game has more in common wtih Medal of Honor than Halo). But this is a good game in it's own right. Once you're a few levels deep you'll find the game quite immersive and addictive. At times I think it's almost too ambitious for the PS2 and might have made a good launch game for the PS3. What we have here is a very good game, from a fledgling developer despite what some would call ""hardware limitations"". If Guerrilla can iron out some of the wrinkles then they'll have a real winner on thier hands.

That being said, HSG Fore is a LOT harder than HSG3! Sure, the graphics are cleaned up, and mini-golf is added. But somehow, it seems a bit more difficult and a slight bit less fun. Not a huge degree, but I can definately say that they stressed more realism in this version.

  You can play with ""Everyone's"" club which basically let's you just select the power meter and then you just whack the ball. Right down to down to micro shot management and losing strokes for hitting into the rough or sand.

  In the end, it's the online play that carries this game. I don't see a ton of people online so PLEASE get an online apapter and join. It's FREE and it's simple. Plus, you can choose from limited clubs, player vs. player or even super large holes. There's a bevy if choices!!

Since I enjoyed Def Jam Vendetta, I figured Def Jam Fight for NY would be worth checking out. It has turned out to be the most entertaining fighting game I have ever played.

The game's single-player storyline revolves around a turf conflict between rival gangs, in which the ownership of clubs and other territory is determined by fights. Over the course of the single-player story, you unlock new fighters and venues which can be selected during other game modes, and develop your character.

The create-a-fighter feature was brilliantly incorporated into the story, and provides a good deal of control over the look of your character. You choose the body type, height, weight, skin tone, head shape, eye shape and color, hair style and color, facial hair style and color, even eyebrow shape and color, and select from one of five fighting styles to start out (kick boxing, street fighting, wrestling, martial arts, submissions).

As you progress through the game, you earn points which can be used to improve your fighter's abilities and learn new moves and up to two additional fighting styles. You also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothing, jewelry, tattoes, and hair styles. The number of choices, which is huge to begin with, increases as you get further through the game. The better dressed you are, the more the crowd favors you, which helps during fights by increasing your ""momentum"" meter. When this meter is full, you are able to go into ""blazin"" mode, where you can perform special moves.

Due to the variety of fighting styles and fight modes available, I think this game will appeal to anyone who enjoys fighting games regardless of their style preference. If you prefer martial arts you can create a fighter that uses kick boxing or martial arts (looks like kung fu in the game), if you prefer wrestling you can create a fighter that uses wrestling and submissions. If you just want smack the hell out of people and aren't concerned with style, you can create a fighter that uses street fighting.

Even my fiancee, who doesn't care much for video games, has found it entertaining. She watches the fights, then when it comes time for me to buy new clothing or jewelry for my fighter or choose a new hair style, she helps me choose (I know a bit about fighting, but nothing about hip hop fashion).

Pros:

Intuitive controls

Great create-a-fighter feature

Impressive graphis

Lots of variety (fighters, venues, styles, clothing, fight types, etc.)

There is one really annoying thing about this software: it wants you to put a disc in every time you open it.

That said, it turns out that Ubi has released some patches online, and if you install them each in turn, that annoyance should go away (in December of 2005, the release of the most recent patch was on the main page but it was not included on the downloads page, but you could follow the link to it from the main page).",Love It,1135987200,4,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

Suddenly they are making kick-ass games. And this is the best so far in my opinion. And best of all, you get to be the bad guys. In other words you control a Nazi submarine (in the time period 1939-1945). You decide yourself if you want this to be a pure U-Boat simulator or a U-Boat arcade game, by adjusting the realism-level. 100% realism means no external camera-view, limited oxygen and batteries etc. You will have to live and act like a real submarine-captain. While 0% realism means full external camera-view, unlimited oxygen and batteries etc. You can also choose anything between 0% and 100% realism. Like full external view but limited oxygen. If you choose campaign-mode you will be assigned with different missions. Usually it will be to patrol a certain grid on the map for 24 hours, and you are bound to encounter some enemy ships along the way (usually british). The more enemy ships you sink, the better, and the more medals you will receive. Another thing that caught my attention in this game is the music (like I mentioned). Wow. Completely awesome.

Coolest moment so far in the game, for me, was me versus a British destroyer outside of Gibraltar at night during a storm. You NEED to try it for yourself. Obviously superb graphics here as well.

Another great thing about this game is the fact that everything on the DVD will be copied to the harddisk, so you won't have to locate the disc every time you want to play it. This is common with games meant for online-playing, like this one. I have all the other games in the Silent Hunter series, and this is by far the best in my opinion. In Silent Hunter 5 the problem was that new crappy feature that requires constant internet-connection to play it, In Silent Hunter 4 the problem was that you have to use the disc every time you play it. Silent Hunter 4 was set in the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II, and was a great game but I still think Silent Hunter 3 is the best. If you prefer the Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II, beautiful turquoise water and white beaches you might enjoy Silent Hunter 4 more, but if you are a real man, you'll choose the cold, dark water of the Atlantic:-)",I would have bought this for the music (score) alone,1286841600,2,{'Platform:': ' windows_xp'},
4,False,"05 23, 2005",A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B00024W1U6,Terry Mesnard,"The last two years has seen some unorthodox RPGs.  With Shadow Hearts: Covenant, Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne and now the two Digital Devil Sagas, the Final Fantasys and other Square-Enix games have some creative competition.

After reading all the reviews and looking into this game, I was really excited to try it.  I am about 20 hours (my characters are around lvl 44) into the game and for all intents and purposes I think I've only scratched the surface.  I wanted to give my current review of the game up to this moment to let people uncertain if they want to purchase it what the game is about.

It has aptly been called a dark pokemon game.  This is true in that you must negotiate with demons and find ways to recruit them to your side.  However, a downfall to this sytem is that it boils down to you giving up hard won items like healing items, items to ressurect your people, 100s of Macca (the currency).  And normally it goes, ""that is not enough, give me 1 life stone...I'm still not convinced give me 500 Macca...okay you're starting to piss me off, give me 1 revival bead...no, I'm sorry but I don't want to join you.""  So you just wasted 500 Macca, 1 life stone and 1 revival bead on someone who just vanishes.  If at any time you say no, the negotiations stop.  Now, other demons you get can learn skills to help in the negotiation process.  But, sometimes it's hard to justify an ability like Nag that is supposed to help get uncertain demons when you can only have 6 skills.  If it comes down to learning that next heal spell or Nag, I'm going to have to go with the healing spell over Nag.  So it can be frustrating to get some demons to your side.  Other times it's s snap.

Then, you are able to fuse these demons together to create more powerful demons that share some of the qualities and skills of the previous two you had.  More depth is added by the change of the moon cycle and the ability to sacrifice a third demon to make your demons even more powerful.  It's a cool concept that works really well for the most part.  IF you know what you're doing.

Which leads me to my biggest problem with the game.  If you don't carefully plan out your demons and your demon fusing even early in the game, you will have a very hard time as the game progresses.  You see, another concept that figures heavy into the battle system is the weakness/strength based on skills.  Some enemies are weak to your skills, some nullify certain skills, some drain hp from skills, some reflect these abilities, etc etc.  If you score a hit the enemy is weak against, you gain another turn to act in your round.  If your attack is nullified, you lose turns.  The same happens to you.  So, if you end up fusing demons together and have to fight a boss that your new demon is weak to, problems can occur.  Especially if that demon is your healer and is killed in round two...

On top of that, when you fuse demons you don't get all of the skills the previous demons had.  You get a random assortment based on luck and what levels your demons are.  The higher the level the more skills transfer.  The result is that you end up getting two demons chosen for fusing, don't like the abilities, so leave the fusing process and go back in until you get a mix of skills you want.  Also, each demon can only hold a certain amount of skills and when they learn new skills and the demon is maxed, you have to get rid of one of their skills.  And that skill is gone forever.  Chances are, you'll need that skill that you just lost at a future time.  What seems unimportant now, can end up saving your life later.  And it can be frustrating, trying to create your characters as the best of what they can do and then have normal enemies or boss battles trounce you in two rounds.

I have been playing RPGs since the very first Final Fantasy graced our shores.  I have never found an RPG as hard as this one.  In fact, with the exception being a COUPLE boss battles that I can count on one hand, I almost never die in an RPG.  This game gives you two settings to choose from at the beginning, normal and hard.  I chose normal.  Traveling in the over world map, in areas where a character of my level is supposed to be can become death traps if you happen to run into an enemy that has attacks your party is weak against.  Or, heaven forbid, your main character is weak against.  Ran into a group of characters who have a death attack.  I had spent about an hour grinding in the field (you'll also be doing that a lot by the way) only to have someone cast Mudo, a death type spell, on my main character.  He's not weak to the attack but the attack went through, character died, there went 1 hour of my leveling.  You can only save in terminals, not on the world map and in this instance I was pretty far from a terminal and didn't want to spend the extra travel time just to get back and save.  Be warned, save often!

Also, in reference to the weakness/strength problem, you are given the skill Analyze.  It will give you the enemies hp/mp and their strengths and weaknesses.  So this is good, right?  Well it doesn't work on bosses which can become a trial and error as you probably won't have the right combination of people the first time you fight the boss.  Chances are, you will wipe.  The guide book is more helpful in this area and can usually help you prepare better (see my book comment below).

The game can be classified as a dungeon crawl.  Not in the typical sense, but in the sense that no matter where you go chances are there will be enemies to fight.  Finding areas of safety where you won't run into random encounters are few and far between.  In my 20 hours of playtime I have run into less than 5 I believe.  Most ""towns"" (I use that term loosely) where you can save/heal/buy/sell/fuse/etc have enemy encounters.  On top of that, the encounter rates are higher than most RPGs.  Sometimes you can run through a room with little or no encounters.  Other times, you can run into battle after battle.  There is a glowing compas on your UI that is supposed to alert you by changing colors as it gets closer to an encounter but that's not always truthful.  It has gone from yellow (the first step) to red (the last) in one step and a battle starts.

So far, the story is pretty linear and honestly not too exciting.  As far as I know, it's mainly a quest to find this guy and stop his plans of unleashing a very bad weapon.  Yes, the story is dark, deals with the end of the world and also has angels and demons and familiar religious mantra in it but at this point in time it's not too terribly exciting.  I'm hoping that something will happen that will change the focus of the story.

I cannot recommend this game to RPG newbies.  You will be frustrated and might not ever play an RPG again.  This is not a starter's RPG; it's made for the hard core group of people as you have to put a lot of time and effort into it.  I would also recommend picking up the strategy guide.  I don't normally do or recommend that, but at 400 pages it is almost essential in creating the best demon combinations and working your way through some really tough bosses.

If you are new to the Shin Megami Tensei series, personally I would recommend the newer Digital Devil Saga (and its forthcoming sequel).  Almost all of my complaints above are addressed and fixed in that game; it also adds sorely needed voice actors and at this juncture in time has a better plot.

I know it seems as if there are a lot of ""complaints"" in my review which might seem incongruous with my score of 4.  But I'm not exactly complaining; I just want to make sure that those who are on the fence with this game know all of the good and bad inside.  I think it has the ability to really frustrate some players and I would hate to have new RPGers come to this game and decide the genre is not for them.  I am enjoying the game for the most part, though I think I might enjoy Digital Devil Saga I and II better.  Truth be told, the dugeon I'm currently in (the Obelisk for those who know) is kicking my ass which made me turn to Digital Devil Saga.  For Nocturne, the combat system is deep and rewarding for those who play right, the dungeons are (mostly) long but fun and I have a feeling the plot is going to rachet up another level soon.  But casual gamers need not apply.

**By the way, don't you dare spend the $60-80 on this game that the people are selling theirs through this site!  That's outrageous that people are already selling it at that price.

Atari did a very good job in this third installment of the DBZ Budokai series! Amazing graphics, fast game-play, and loads of characters make this game the ultimate DBZ game, and in my opinion, I personally think that this game is better than it's sequel, DragonBall Z Budokai Tenkaichi!

This game's graphics are two-demensional, cell-shaded, and very bright and colorful! These kind of graphics are not found in many games, and I think that they sometimes look better than the three-demensional graphics!

The story mode in the game is great! It is a somewhat ""adventure"" style story mode! You get to pick one of the story characters, and you can fly around with them int he environment provided! It is not exactly adventure because you you only have one destination, but it's kind of fun that you get to fly to it, and sometimes find some goodies on your way there!

Gameplay! This game's gameplay is amazing! The control combinations actually work, unlike the ones in DBZ Budokai: Tenkaichi, and the Finishing Moves in this game are the best, surpassing all the other games (including DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi)! The fighting is very fast, and will suit all exeptional players! The opponents you fight in this game are not impossible to defeat like the ones in DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi, and with cooperative button combinations, the bosses are very easy to defeat (unless you have the settings on hard)!

This game is a very fun game, and I recommend that you buy this game instead of it's sequel, DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi (which is $50.00), for this game is only $30.00, and is, overall, a much better game!

There are so many good things I can compliment this game about; graphics, gameplay, destruction, action, and so much more, but there is just one thing that I did not like about this game.

The way they show you the story! I don't like it at all! This game has absolutely no cutscenes in it! All you see is a small picture of the face of the character that is talking with a speech bubble coming out of it! That is how they show you the story! Even in the first installment of the DBZ Budokai series they had better cut-scenes and character interaction! This is basically the only flaw/fault that I see in this game, and I definetly think it's the best DBZ game on the market right now!

It was unlike any other game and it was the first of the star wars games where you can choose your path. The second one however wasn't anywhere near as good as the first. It lacked in many things and it seemed as if Lucas arts didn't put any effort into the game and they just decided to throw another KOTOR out there because the first one made a lot of money. This isn't too surprising because lucas arts has done this many times, they arn't too well of a game creating company.

  KOTOR 2 is not a horrible game, but don't think it is any better than the first or even as good. The fact that you are already a jedi is cool but its like you don't get a lightaber for a while, and you don't just get one, you have to find the things to make it so it can even take longer than the first. The STORY LINE is horrible and it makes the game really boring. The first had a great story line, but this one is bad. It just sort of throws you out there and its almost a repeat of the first. Like the first the storly line has you specially connect with another jedi I got bored of this fact and the story line has no specific objectives. It is just basically kill one master jedi on each planet. And you get confused because you can just leave and fly to any planet without doing the objective so then you get lost and you can think you're done with a planet but you really aren't and you start wondering what you still have to do to beat the game. The story line also keeps you confused by having you not know a lot of things that happened in the past because it isn't a continuation of the first. Its like you don't know what gooing on through the whole game.

  The gameplay is basically the same thing as the first and has nearly no differences. The wierd thing is that your party members also follow you to whichever path you take. And say you choose to go to the darkside, when you do something bad like kill someone good your party members always ask why they went with the flow. And its like everytime, it got really annoying. The game also tends to slow down and freeze for a second or two during the play. The worst with that situation is the menu. When you hit pause it takes a second to get there and when you switch to a different option in the menu it stalls for a second.

  The graphics are a little bit better than the first not a lot though. The graphics are probably a real low in this game because all the other games during this time have good graphics, but the graphics for this game are like 2 years ago. And the game has rarely any cinematechs and all they are are your ship flying to a different planet or going into hyperspace.

  The game does have some good points like the new force powers you get and the game still has that cool feeling of turning to the darkside and choosing your path like you really are a jedi. There is a problem with the whole fact of the changing sides thing though. Its like if you turn to the darkside you really aren't joining any sith in the game, you just make your own side sort of. Its like you turn to the darkside and you're evil but the sith still want you dead and they still fight you and you still want to kill them and the jedi are still like on your side even when you're evil.

  Overall the game is very boring and the one thing RPG games need is an excellent story line and this one does not at all. And the game feels more like an unfinished game. If you have the first and want more, i still recommend this game but don't get your hopes up for it being as good as the first.

If so, you exactly know what to expect from Aura: the interface, the gameplay, the various contraptions, devices and machines, even the landscapes and architectures are strongly derivative. But I DON'T consider this as a criticism! On the contrary, Aura is a good, solid game, very welcome after the dismal disappoinment (IMO) of Uru. Not much of a story, and I have read many reviews stressing the fact that Aura is only a string of puzzles. That's basically true, but don't think to the nearly impossible mathematical puzzles of games like Schizm I & II (but the first Schizm was a great game); rather, almost all of Aura's puzzles (never terribly difficult) are visual, based on manipulations of symbols and patterns; they require attention, logic and observations, and solving them is very satisfying. All in all, I'd say Aura is one of the best among Myst and Myst-clone games as to the quality of the puzzles. Add an intriguing atmosphere, very nice visuals and an excellent price: what you get is, maybe, not a groundbreaking masterpiece but certainly a solid, entertaining (may I say intelligent?) game, deserving success.

The store in my area allows me to trade in games for used ones so I got this one. Having played ""From Russia with Love"" which was a great Bond by EA, I went ahead and received this one for a mere five bucks.

Well unlike the other game it's a first person shooter. Not really a bad thing but the game can get rather repetitive. The AI as others have pointed out could have used more work but in general a lot of First Person Shooters (especially the early ones) are known for this. The game also doesn't quite have the depth, replay value or creativity that the other game had too. On a scale of 1-10, I would give the other game close to a 10 and this game about a 5 1/2.

The graphics were easy on the eyes and boatload of movies were fun to watch. It was also a treat for a brief time to hear the voice of the great Christopher Lee.

The story is all over the place but if you're a Bond fan I doubt you'll care. You accidentally kill Bond himself then work for Goldfinder or Dr. No? Then along the way you meeet Bond girl Pussy Galore or something like that.

9. Trey Wingo is in the game giving the injury reports for the week and Mel Kiper Jr. is in the game as well, giving us scouting reports from top draft picks for the next year (no 3D model though, bummer!)
10. Draft Picks have faces that are combined from the physical features of today's players!
11. The Halftime has been vastly improved as well, instead of screenshots in last years version, we now have streaming video of the best plays of the half!
12. Franchise has improved as well. Giving we, the people the power to manage our teams on a daily basis (have a pass-savvy team you're facing next week, send them to film to analyze the pass)

5,True,"03 18, 2005",ATB2PLCVQ2XC9,B0002ILSIS,Bradley,"I was apprehensive about buying this game.  However, I went ahead and laid down the money and have been extremely pleased with my decision.  First of all, the graphics are very good and the racing can get intense.  The action is fast paced and all of the tracks look as they do on TV.

One thing I love is the Nascar 2005 can be a very deep game with a lot of replay value.  Of course, if you just want to race one race at a time you can do that, but if you want to start a carrier, it is very detailed and involved.  You start in the Featherweight division with little money and no fans.  After you start winning some races, you gain money, fans, and notoriety among the other racers.  You also have an agent who will help you climb the ladder of fame.  If you do well in the Featherweight, you can move up to the Truck series, the Bush series, and then on to Nascar.  However, you have to wait for offers to come across from car owners in that particular division.  For example, if you are doing well in the Bush series Motorola may offer you a deal to drive for them in Nascar.  You can take the deal, or hold out to try and get a better offer from another sponsor.  It's totally up to you.  You will also be challenged to street races by some of the Nascar drivers.  These are pretty cool because they allow you to race with streetcars such as the new 2005 Ford Mustang!  If you win, you will gain notoriety and the drivers will respect you more on the track.

Another aspect that I love is the gas pedal.  With the gas being the right top button on the XBOX controller, you can use it just like an actual pedal.  You can let off a little to make it through the turns then floor it on the straightaway's.  It really gives you more control of your car because you are able to make it through the turns easily, while still applying a little bit of gas.  Very nice!

Also, the addition of the ""share draft"" and ""intimidate"" buttons work nicely.  If you are drafting someone that is on the inside of a two car wide draft, you can press the ""share draft"" button and it will suck you up on the car in front of you.  This allows the driver to pass cars on the outside because the more cars you have in a draft, the faster you are.  As for the ""intimidate"" button, you can press and then literally intimidate the car in front of you.  If you have the button locked in and bump draft the car you are intimidating, he will usually move out of your way.  However, if you are too rough you could tick him off and cause him to come after you.  Yeah, I've been wrecked a couple of times for pissing off a driver.

Butcher Bay happens to fit the niche nicely. After Half-Life 2 there was only really the Call of Duty: United Offensive as a good first person shooter (Doom 3 being an older game now and Far Cry also... you should play all of these if you have not). Riddick comes off the back of a very bad sequel to the surprise hit Pitch Black. Here we actually play a game that should maybe have been the sequel. It is certainly heaps better.

The premise is very good. You are Riddick in a maximum security prison somewhere on a planet with inmates voiced by leading actors and facial expressions that are nearly as good as HL2. The atmosphere of the prison is A+ as you go about the place taking on various missions in the cells (fighting, buying drugs, snubbing out bosses, causing a riot, doing jobs for people) so that you can... escape Butcher Bay.

The menu is astonishing at first as it opens up like a cube and the buttons move around, however owners of ATI RADEON cards may experience some shading difficultly and a few glitches in the cut sequences and models now and again (there a number of shading options to help improve this). Riddick is mostly about stealth moves, like grabbing people from behind and either slicing them or breaking their neck. You can get into hand-to-hand combat where the enemies face actually bruises and bleeds. Clubs and knives have a similar effect. The story breaks nicely at the end of each level where you meet your foes. Riddick banters off some classic one-liners and there is quite a bit of swearing. You can talk to some of the characters and choose your answers.

Once the prison riot starts, you are given weapons to escape the prison and the real rush begins (Doom 3 type fast and furious blasting). Enemy AI is quite good and the game plays very smoothly from start to finish. For all intensive purposes, the game play is very much like DEUS EX but the graphics are a way better. It is surprising how long this game is, given that it just seems like a movie tie-in package. It is not. This is a FULLY FLEDGED first person shooter all the way.

I had difficulty running this on a 256mb card, 3ghz P4 and 1gig of ram on full screen resolution and had to take the graphics down a bit. It seems like this game is more for the 512mb series on the way. Anything less than a 128mb card may not do the game justice.

It seems that high-end graphics ""adult"" first person shooters are back again! Bottom line is to play it.

Pros:

- Great Story

- Great Graphics

- As good as any new 1st person shooter.

- It is long.

Cons:

- Not enough stealth jump moves.

- Enemy AI can sometimes get a little repetitive.

- Needs a fast high spec machine to run properly.

I had no problem at all copying the files from the Nykos to the Max, nor have I had any problem with loading files from the Max. The problem comes in with trying to save.

I was sincerely hoping this would at least attempt to fix some of them. I have no idea what I was thinking. Not only did the customers who ordered the game as it came out have to run hours worth of upgrades to fix glitches in the expansion, most of the quests and items weren't available due to further problems. Which makes me wonder if Square-Enix just threw the game out as soon as possible, without actually putting any effort into it.
So far, there's absolutely nothing I find useful from the expansion. It HAS introduced a few new items, but most can only be used by classes that already have a nice variety of items available to them. The expansion pack also introduced new areas, one of which is a new city. Wait, no, Square isn't just going to let you go to the new town after you bought the expansion, you'll have to undertake series of horribly tedious missions to unlock the passage. The missions are exactly the same; wait around a few hours to form an alliance then try and survive a trip to a boss fight, except each area looks *slightly* different.
I will admit the new areas that can be accessed freely [...] were pretty fun to explore and introduced some fairly cool monsters, but haven't benefited me in a single way.
NO new jobs were introduced with this expansion. The J&R Music review points out you can get Dark Knight, Summoner and Ninja, but all those jobs are available without Chains of Promathia.

5,False,"11 12, 2005",A1TR0WPC93BEC8,B0002XL3BA,Brendan L. Agnew,"God of War has the distinction of being one of the (many) early contenders for Game of the Year. Even being released at a time packed with other fantastic games (Devil May Cry 3, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Resident Evil 4, Jade Empire), God of War manages to make a lasting mark on the action/adventure genre.

The story of God of War is one pieced together from and inspired by Greek mythology. Olympus, the home of the gods, is in chaos. Ares, the god of war, has declared. . . well, war on his bretheren, wreaking havoc against his sister, Athena's, capital city. With Athens burning and a decree from Zeus himself that the gods cannot take direct action against Ares, his brothers and sisters turn to a fallen hero, a tortured soul who wants nothing more than to destroy Ares for his own reasons.

Stepping into the sandals of a half-god Spartan general named Kratos, the player is immediately introduced to some of the most fluid, brutal, cinematic, and rewarding combat of any game this generation. Instead of the ""dial-a-combo"" style of combat used in action games like Ninja Gaiden, God of War offers the players a set of fairly simple moves, and the ability to string them together in a myriad of ways for near-endless strings of combos. The blades that Kratos uses (gruesome swords literally chained to his arms) whirl through the air to slice into enemies, plunge through flesh, or hurl them into the air.

In fact, the over-the-top violence of God of War is something to note; it doesn't share the comical/sattirical nature of the mayhem in the Grand Theft Auto games, and it pulls NO punches; there are even scenes of nudity and suggested (well, more like heard-but-not-seen) sexual content. However, the game is one of a brutal story set in a brutal world about a VERY brutal main character, so it fits the mood and themes.

The game also strives to create a very visceral and cinematic experience for every minute that the player is in control, allowing the player brutal finishing moves to decapitale, eviscerate, and dismember his enemies. Likewise, through properly-timed button presses, Kratos can scale enormous bosses and deliver crushing and stylized blows to specific body parts to bring them down. One particularly memorably moment is the fight against the three-headed dragon from Greek mythology, the Hydra, who the players must destroy using an etire ship as a weapon.

Along with the compelling story (told through the excellent in-game engine as well as through stunning Full Motion Video scenes) and the brutal and easily adaptable combat, the game features some solid puzzles when it switches from burning city battlefields to ancient dunegons and temples. For the most part, these challenges will be very familiar to anyone who has played the Legend of Zelda series, but God of War adds its signature dark twist to these (you'll find yourself using Medusa's head to turn enemies to stone and place them on pressure switches).

However, it's also in these dungeons that the game shows it's one (very minor) Achille's heel. The fact that Kratos, a half-god with the power to bring down a Titan, can be easily killed by a simple swinging blade is fairly annoying; and the platforming (involving said blades), is the game's weakest part. It's not horrible, but it doesn't quite show the same level of polish and quality as the rest of the title. Platforming is also the only time you'll see the graphics falter. Easily one of the best-looking games on the PS2, GoW's only problem is a slight awkard animation when Kratos jumps (especially when compared to the animation in titles like the recent Prince of Persia games).

However, these are VERY small faults in a VERY good game. The title has excellent replay value, with multiple difficulty levels, unlockables, special ""making the game"" features, and a quest that will take at least 10-15 hours for even hardcore gamers to play through once (and you'll want to play this one multiple times).

Overall, if you're looking for a magnificent and hard-hitting action game experience with a good share of head-scratching bits as well, you can't go wrong with God of War. Just keep this one away from the kids.",A God among action games. . .,1131753600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The controls are very hard to manage without a joystick or something.  I was using the default controls which consist of using your keyboard and mouse (sometimes at the same time!).  Also, the spoken dialog is heard about 15 seconds prior to the character's mouths actually moving.  The spoken dialog is also heard about 15 seconds prior to seeing it spelled out in subtitles.  I don't know what is causing this large delay, but it sucks!

Even though I haven't played a PS2 version of this game, I'm sure it has to be much better in terms of control and the dialog problem.  I have played ALL the other Silent Hill games for the PS1 and PS2, and I never had a problem with them.

I visited the various tech support sites listed in the instruction manual to get help with the sound/dialog problem, but there is absolutely no help for SH4 tech problems (as of yet).  Perhaps this is because the game is still relatively new, and PC players of the game are still in the process of getting royally pissed off like I just did.

Only buy the PC version of Silent Hill 4 if you have a joystick or something.  Using the keyboard and mouse controls is just too difficult and very frustrating.  Better yet, stick with the PS2 version!  Believe me, you'll be glad you did!!

To come after the single greatest online shooter in history, it is an insult, an atrocious abomination worthy of scorn beyond measure. However, even if it were called something completely different, and in no way related to Unreal Championship, it would still be a very bad game. It lacks entertainment value in spades, the story, while actually pretty good, is extremely short and is replaced with the standard tournament style ladders, and the characters are frustratingly bland.

Malcolm, the one really interesting character, can only be unlocked by going through an absolutely excruciating series of challenges, which manage to be both horribly difficult and horribly boring at the same time, which is a triumph in and of itself. The addition of Raiden from Mortal Kombat is a humorous marketing ploy which, while probably making them millions, is gimicky at best.

Online play is no better. Gameplay is hampered by difficult controls and the fact that half the weapons can be easily reflected back by anyone with reflexes and the melee weapon every character starts with. The maps are so bad as to be humorous. Half of them are an exercise in jumping, either off of buildings or into lifts to get on to the buildings in order to jump off them again when you find someone who is below you.

When I got it out of the shipping box, everything looked great, no bang marks, no scuffs, no bruises. I made my way into my game room and tried to hook the sucker up to my Playstation 2, to come to find out that at first it didn't work. I put it in the first set of slots, no go! I then put it in the second set of slots, once again...nope! I then went on-line to check if I actually had the right multitap for my system, yup, come to find out that I had the right one. But for the life of me the thing just wouldn't work! I then called one of my good friends that has an old Playstation 2 slim and asked him if he'd ever used a multitap, he sure has. He requested me to come to his place with it, where he would look at it and test it out on his system. After arriving the first thing we did was test it out, it wouldn't work on his system either. He took a good look at it, and came to find out the the end that plug's into the Playstation is all wrong. He showed me his, which it's hook up look a little different than mine. Then he remembered that he'd done a little trick with his and manipulated it into working. He grabbed a set of micro screw drivers and proceeded to unscrew the connecting end of the multitap! He then proceeded to pinch these two plastic hook things that hold the connector that would slide into the game controller port, and he then slid that part all the way forward. He then put the cover piece back on and screwed it back in. Then we had to grab some super glue and glue down the now flimsy part that was a little outside of it's cover piece. After about 4 to 5 well placed super glue dots around the part that was flimsy, within a couple minutes it was rock solid. In ever way and fashion it was nearly impossible to tell the the cover had been removed or that any of the parts were slid forward as to fit inside the game controller port. The piece that was glued acts as if it was meant to be there, rock solid and looks nearly factory. We then proceeded to once again test the multitap on his Playstation 2 slim and it worked. After the nice little visit I made my way home, where I did another test, this time on my system and it worked as well. I would be giving this review 5 stars if it had come ready to go out of the box.

Although this game is very difficult and the card battle system is highly annoying, through all of my frustration... Making it to the end of the game was very rewarding and made it all worth it!
For those of you who have played Kingdom Hearts for the PS2 and are going to play Kingdom Hearts 2, this game is the one that links Kingdom Hearts with Kingdom Hearts 2. In Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the whole story explains what happened to Riku after the events in Kingdom Hearts, and it shows what happened between Axel, Sora, and Namine before Kingdom Hearts 2. So why isn't this game KH2 and the new one for the PS2 Kingdom Hearts 3? Well, it's because this game isn't a true sequel to Kingdom Hearts because you play through all of the same levels as KH1, and by the end of the game Sora loses all of his memories, so it's as though the whole thing never happened. (Dont act like that's a spoiler, play the game for ten minutes and it tells you that it's going to happen.) But it's worth playing to find out what happened between Sora, Axel, and Namine in the past.

For those of you who haven't played the original Kingdom Hearts, or don't own a PS2, the game is worth playing because of how cool the KH series is, and since it's not a true sequel and has a story of it's own... You don't have to play Kingdom Hearts to enjoy it.

Although this game's battle system is very annoying and hard to work with, the game has an amazing story and great graphics!
Making it to the end of the game and seeing the breath taking 3D ending cut scene makes all of the frustration that you felt while playing through certain points in the game all worth it!

Pros: Great game with a great story!
Amazing 3D cut scenes throughout the game make it a pleasant gaming experience!
It's amazing that the GBA is capable of such Great graphics, and PS2 quality cut scenes!
Game contains the KH theme song, ""Simple and clean"" which plays during the credits after you beat the game!
The voice acting, while limited, is still very good.
A great game for people who like Kingdom Hearts, but don't own a PS2.
The story for Riku's mission is very deep and explains what happens after Sora's mission ends, so it's kinda like you're buying 2 games in one!

Cons: The card battle system is very annoying, and takes alot of getting used to.
Leveling up is hard because you have to collect gems that fall from your fallen enemies to gain experience!
Because of how you level up, you have to run around, or roll under other enemies on the field in order to get at the experience gems!
Leveling up is also annoying because of the fact that you need alot of CP (Card Points) to increase the size of your deck, so you're always having to upgrade your CP which makes it hard to find time to upgrade your HP (Health Points)
Sometimes you'll get so frustrated while playing that you will feel like turning it off, and never playing it again!

50/50: You have to unlock The Soul of Rebirth option if you want to play as Riku and find out what happened to him after KH1, but Riku's mission is so much fun and so much less annoying to play than Sora's mission so it's well worth the trouble of beating the game as Sora to unlock it.
While there are no cut scenes during Riku's mission, the cut scene at the end of Riku's mission in nothing short of awesome!

Overall: Although this game can be very annoying at times, and even drive you crazy! The game has a great story, and even when you're most frustrated with it, you'll find yourself wanting to play it just so you can see what happens next. On top of that, this is one of the only GBA games that I've ever seen that has 3D graphics anywhere in the game! Sure there have been other GBA games with some 3D, but not this kind of 3D! I'm talkin' PS2 quality 3D! The game itself isn't 3D, so don't get the wrong idea... But the cut scenes that take place during certain parts of the game are.

4,False,"09 7, 2009",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0006TO2HM,Cloud,"It must be a funny thing being Capcom, a game developer well noted for doing quality games where the sequels have very little differences from one to the next. From Mega Man to Resident Evil and now the Phoenix Wright games, each successive installment usually brings with it the occasional improvement or gameplay mechanic not found in previous titles and Phoenix Wright is no different. I mean, it's still the same interface of the ""Move/Talk/Examine/Present"" screens, the same judge and same courtroom but with different stories and characters and yet they're still fun games. However, as any woman (or man on the defense) will tell you, it's not what you have it's how you use it so while we all know there's not a whole lot of radical changes from the last game ""Trials and Tribulations"" to this, this game still manages to be fun but something seems lacking and it doesn't have the punch that the previous game had but it's still worth a go.

Story: The game centers on Apollo Justice, a new defense attorny with a shiny gold bracelet on his wrist. His first case is the death of a poker player in which the accused is...Phoenix Wright himself. Seems where we last left him, Phoenix has been stripped of his attorney's badge and working as a pianist and poker player. From there, we're introduced to Trucy Wright, a talented and young magician from a very popular and prestigious magician troupe, the Gavin brothers Klavier and Kristoph and uncovering the truth of why Phoenix Wright lost his badge.

One thing I loved about Trials and Tribulations was the whole saga involving Dahlia Hawthorne and her attempts at revenge on the Fey family and seeing that last case wind down was...epic to say the least. Even the individual cases were quite fun with some cool characters and twists but I don't know what it is about Apollo Justice but the cases are intricate and full of twists but it wasn't as ""page-turner"" as the other game was. Even finding out the whole endgame told at the end of the game (har har for wordplay) wasn't as compelling as endings that came before. And the individual cases from a concert to one involving a noodle stand were...odd to say the least.

Graphics: Like I said, same courtroom, same judge, same interface with the court records and profiles but the story changes so it comes down to character designs and with that they're mixed. Our opponent as it were is Klavier Gavin, a prosecutor/rock star combo who likes to air guitar and pound the wall behind him is a cool character but he wasn't as...threatening shall we say as other prosecutors. We also have one of the most irritating reporters I've seen and a freakishly weird (not to mention creepy) university student but then we have Ema Skye returning in her cute snackoo-munching glory. There's also some cool 3D videos used to highlight the crime scenes in different ways such as changing angles or giving a good feel on the layout but by the last case, they were few and far between.

Sound/Music: Now I gotta say the music is quite catchy and given in appropriate moments, can really add suspense to a scene or make things light-hearted. Naturally the only voice acting ever said is ""objection!"", ""take that!"" or ""hold it!"" though I still find it funny when you get that girlish ""objection!"" like what Winston Payne used to do. But there's not a whole lot to the music other than its catchyness and voice acting is virtually non-existent so there's not much to say on this part.

Gameplay: Same ol, same old, the investigation phase where you gather evidence (where you still can't access the next scene unless you find that one piece of evidence or present something to someone which'll trigger the next scene when you move into a new area), the trial phase where you press statements, offer contradictions and be fined penalties if you're wrong. One new feature added is the ability to look at certain pieces of evidence in a 3D space and rotate or zoom in on them and examine things on them such as markings or prints but it's not really used often as I would like and most of the time they're not vitally important, they're just little asides characters chat about and make comments about. One thing that I did like though was that it was a bit more easier to know what to present whereas I felt in previous games I couldn't figure out why a certain piece of evidence was giving me a penalty when you know it makes sense.

The other new addition is in regards to a certain ""ability"" Apollo has. Like Phoenix and the Psyche-Locks, Apollo has the ability to ""perceive"" witnesses habits and points out inconsistencies by errors they make. This goes into a super-slow reading of the statement in which you try to find the one visual habit that gives them away when they say a specific phrase. Only problem is you're not told what phrase or what nervous habit to look for and since the top screen doesn't really show the habit in detail, it's kind of hard to tell what to even find. For example, one character has glasses that hides their eyes thanks to lighting (like Kevin in ""Sin City"") that when in ""perceive mode"" shows their eyes in more detail and yet the habit is in the eyes and with 5 statements that are reading suupppppeeerrr sllloooowly, it kind of makes it annoying to find that one statement where he decides to actually doing something abnormal.

Phoenix Wright games always have a charm about them from the cast of characters, the winding plots and naturally, murder mysteries by themselves are intriguing. Save for a couple of weird plotholes and ""wait, now how would...?"" moments, they've always been engaging even though this is basically a re-skinned first game.

Roman,"Late last year, I finally got a copy of WarioWare: Touched!, after always being on the fence about buying 'just' a collection of mini-games. The first one for GBA looked fun but I didn't get a chance to play it. Boy do I wish I had, because this DS installment constantly provides me with entertainment. WarioWare: Touched! is a perfect example of a game that you can play anywhere at any time. In the bathroom, on a bus, while waiting in a long line, waiting for a movie to start, you name it.

This is a fairly large collection of mini-games that you keep playing until you lose all your lives. There's a very short, simple 'story' to it, though it's mostly just Wario and his crew coming together to play a concert. There are cutscenes before you start the mini-games that show the story, but you can skip them, though they're pretty funny here and there. The games are just a few short seconds long, never longer than 8 seconds, and cover a bunch of styles. One has you squishing fleas on a dog, one has you undressing a heavily clothed guy at a beach, another has you pop bubbles, and one just has you pass a basketball. There's a ton of different games, each one using a different style of play (blowing into the microphone, tapping, scratching, etc.) so that things don't get reptitive. You can always choose to play just one mini-game over and over until you lose, going for a new record each time.

What I love is how zany the game is. It doesn't take anything seriously, and the obscure additions to some classic art pieces had me smiling. In fact, the graphics are different for every mini-game. Some are 8-bit NES segments, others are just stick figures and others only use a few frames, kind of like a short flipbook. You might want to set your DS' brightness on a lower setting though if you have sensitive eyes, because things can get very bright in some of the games. The soundtrack's just as quirky, though you might never even notice it because of how short the games are, and how focused you'll be on accomplishing the tasks. 'gotta love the voices though.

The only complaint I have is that I wanted more. There are a lot of people in Wario's group that you can select to play their games, and there are a lot for each person, but I wanted even more. I don't know how much free space was left on the game chip, but I sure would've been fine with them taking out the useless 'toys' like the calculator, piano and coloring book if it meant more games.

WarioWare: Touched! is great for any age group. My daughter was playing this at 2 and a half, and still loves it now that she's almost 3. Anyone can figure it out and have fun.

- Story appears to be told from 2 points of view like in the film Rashomon.
- In easy level, if you die you can continue immediately where you left off.
- AI does appear slightly improved. E.g. In a botched stealth kill I landed in front of the enemy and got my throat slit and died instantly. Bosses appear to be more difficult too. You can't simply stand and block indefinitely anymore, they have special moves to counter blocks.
- I played this game initially in the most difficult level thinking it would be a breeze after having played all the other Tenchus. Nope. Had to go back down to Easy level to survive.

Cons:
- Non fans will find this game dated- especially having played Metal Gear Solid and Splinter Cell. Just remember that the original Tenchu came out roughly at the same time as Metal Gear so it is one of the pioneers in the field- which is why it has such a strong, but niche, following.
- Camera is still as difficult as previous Tenchus- but fans will have no problems. Non fans will probably want to throw their controller at the screen.
- Models of characters seem rather chunky even for PS2.",For Fans,1109030400,17,,

The only reason you have to see the movie before you buy this game is because the game completely gives away the movie. It's just like watching the movie on your DS. Other than that the game is perfect.

Graphics: Outstanding graphics for a DS game. I've seen some of the other games for DS and their graphics aren't nearly as good as these. Multiplayer mode (the place where you fly ships) looks almost as good as a PSP game, except whan you blow up, then it looks it was from a coloring book.

Controls: Very basic, very easy. Sometimes I might try to block a low attack with L down and accidently hit R down and choke him to death, but who cares. Starship controls are complicated, I changed mine the first time I played it.

Multiplayer: Awesome, sort of. You can only play multiplayer with starships which is why its only sort of awesome. I've always wanted to duel my friend and show him I'm just as good with a lightsaber as I am with a starship, but that's why we have PS2.

4,False,"05 30, 2005",A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B0007SL1ZI,Ian,"It's amazing to see how popular EA's lord of the rings hack n' slash games are.  The format used is done so well, that Lucasarts and the Collective took that format and replaced everything with Star Wars.

Revenge of the Sith for PS2 is a simple hack n' slash, beat-em-up game.  You go down a linear path, killing enimies, pressing switches, jumping occasionally, and going down more paths, killing more enimies, etc.  When you make a kill, you get a grade of fair, good, impressive, and masterfull.  The more kills you get, the faster your skill meter fills up, and the more experience points you get to upgrade your charachter.

Sound familiar?  It should be.  While the gameplay is a disguised copy of the Lord of the rings format, it works for the most part, but could use more touch up (more on that later).

For a hack-n-slash game, Revenge of the sith looks pretty good.  The enviornments and worlds look really good (especially the planet of mustafar).  Every area looks good and has lots of little touches to set it apart from the other worlds.  Grievous's flagship for example, has battleships floating outside, blasting each other to bits (which is quite fun to watch).  Mustafar has volcaones, couroscant has a gigantic city-scape, etc.  Overall, the game looks good, but certian things could use more improvement.  The clone troopers and Yoda, for example, have a boxy look to them.  It's not a huge problem, but it is noticable.

One nice draw of Revenge of the Sith is it's big one on one duels.  You've got Obi-wan vs General Grievous (complete with four lightsabers, yikes!), Anakin vs Mace Windu (""Ready for this boy?!"") Anakin vs Count Dooku, Anakin vs Stunt Coordinator Nick Gallard (*Face turns red in anger and steam rushes out of ears*), and the final showdown between Anakin and Obi-wan (which is just as awesome as it is in the movie).

While the game has sixteen levels, it isint very long.  I completed it in about eight hours.  Short yes, but fun.  When you finish the main part of the game, you can then go and try out the bonus missions, which are simple ""kill em all"" missions.  It is however, quite fun to play as Yoda and General Grievous.  There's also a two player coopertive mode thats a complete waste of time (you go through rooms killing an endless amount of enimies.  Gets boring in about ten seconds).

There's also a duel mode where you can play as the games big charachters in one on one fights in several locations, such as Anakin dueling Greivous in Couroscant, Count Dooku and Obi wan fighting on Mustafar, etc.  You get a lot of arenas and a good amount of fighters, but why no yoda or emperor?  One Feature I like is that if you're playing the duel mode by yourself, the computer will play as the second charachter, so you can enjoy it by yourself.

There are also a lot of concept art that you unlock going through the game, some of which is quite cool (Anakin wearing his vader armor withought the helmet for example).  One big bonus of the game is that it includes several sequences that are not in the movie, such as a fight on Grievous's ship as it turns completly upside down (cool!).  Several battles are also extended, such as Anakin and Mace's fight, which is now a lot longer.

Probably the biggest problems I have with Revenge of the Sith are it's combat system and it's lack of charachter selection in replay.  The combat system that Revenge of the Sith uses is almost identical to that of EA's lord of the rings titles.  It was perfected in Return of the king, but sadly the system here is not as good.  While it's fairly easy to reach maximum skill in LOTR games, here it's almost impossible to get anything outside of ""Fair"".  Getting ""good"" is really tough.  Getting ""impressive"" takes forever, and getting ""masterfull"" is almost impossbile.  Each sucsessful hit on an enemy gets you one point on the skill meter.  Each hit on you takes away a skill point on the meter.  And you get hit a lot, meaning that your meter gets emptied very quickly.

As a result, the combat system suffers from getting too little experience points for all the hacking and slashing that you do.  It would have been nice if the developers copied the Return of the king combat system directly, as it had been pretty much perfected in that game (which is still fun two years later).

The other quibble I have is that unlike the LOTR games, you cannot play any level with any charachter once you finish the game.  If a level plays with Anakin, then you're stuck playing as Anakin forever.  It was so cool to be able to mess around with ""what if"" situations, but you cannot do that here.  It would have added a LOT of replay value.  Think of it!  Mace Windu on Mustafar, fighting Anakin skywalker.  General Grievous teaming up with Yoda to cleanse the Jedi Temple of clone troopers, etc.

As it is, Revenge of the Sith is a good, fun game that I enjoy a lot.  While it has the possibility of adding so much more, it's good as it stands.  I recommend buying it used, as i'd pay about twenty dollars for the game, not fifty, but you should probably rent it first.

Oh, one last thing.  You can play as Anakin and kill obi-wan in the final battle on mustafar, giving you a cool ""What if"" alternate ending.  That alone is quite fun to watch.",Lord of the rings in space,1117411200,17,,
5,False,"04 14, 2005",A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B0007TFLLM,blackaciddevil,"One of the things that Sony did right during its' launch was listening to the people and giving them what they wanted during the PSP's launch in the way of games. One of the games that people were wanting was a Twisted Metal to play on the go. So, Sony gives us Twisted Metal: Head On. I must admit, I've been a Twisted Metal fanatic for quite sometime but this one blows them all away(except for TM2: World Tour and Twisted Metal Black, of course)...quite literally..;). I was simply amazed when I first booted up my PSP and saw Head On in action. It does provide fast-paced vehicular combat and destruction for an addictive pick-up and play experience. The fact that I can play this on the go is what blows me away..I just can't believe it. Out of all the PSP games I have, this is the one that has kept me occupied the longest.

There's plenty of replayability in the form of minigames with unlockables and secrets to be had. There are a few secret characters to unlock, both by completing the story mode normally and by finding secrets buried within the levels. The Minigame challenges will unlock added extras for single and multiplayer games, which I won't spoil for you here.

Head-On gets it's visual/graphical inspiration from Twisted Metal 2: World Tour. The levels are bright, vivid and colorful.

You get 9 levels to do battle on. There's the Big Blue Stadium, Los Angeles, Paris, Egypt, Roman Ruins, Russia, Greece, Monaco, Tokyo--which consists of Tokyo Streets and Tokyo Rooftops. You'll meet Dark Tooth & Tower Tooth(wait'll see Sweet Tooth now) on Tokyo Streets in the end. Let me warn you, though, Tower Tooth is a doozy of a boss to beat. There is a simple way to beat him that involves staying somewhere in the open where he can't get to you but I'll let you figure that one out. The only time you'll have to venture out is to gather ammo. Course, my nephew beat Tower Tooth without my strategy so to each his own--I guess. Again, I warn you, he's tough so you'll have to keep on the go.

What bothers me with the game though, not that I'm complaining, is the fact that Incognito could've did so much more with the game. Kinda like they did, somewhat, with Twisted Metal Black. I could think of a hundred different ways to improve on the game. Introducing a few (more appealing) new characters into the fold(like it did in Black), new vehicles, as well as new weapons, different strategies to beat other combatants by.  In order to keep hardcore fans interested, you need to keep the game fresh and new...you know? Maybe Incognito can rectify that if they make a sequel to Head On. That being said, there's nothing more wrong with the game that I could find. It's a fine return to the gameplay of old.

Other than that, Head-On is fun-fun-fun..a must have for all PSP owners. It's one of the better ones in the lineup of PSP launch titles.",Twisted Metal Head On......,1113436800,,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},
4,False,"04 26, 2005",AFKMK18ZXRU0Q,B0007TFLLC,Rick V,"Touted as the next Walkman, the Playstation Portable (PSP) brings a new face to portable electronic devices.  The PSP comes with a brilliant 4.3 in. LCD that is amazingly clear.  I can assure you that the cost of this little gem is less than what it costs Sony to manufacture them.  Compare the PSP with any handheld device and you'll see what I mean.  Pitted against a Pocket PC, one with the same functionality and 333mhz processor could easily cost double the ticket price for the PSP.  This strategy is common among consoles, when the xbox was first released Microsoft realized a loss on every unit sold.  But these losses are all made up on the back end by revenue from games and movies.

At this time of release, the PSP only has a handful of game and movie titles available.  Of which I've only tried Ridge Runner and Untold Legends.  One being a first person track racing game and other a role playing type fantasy game.  The graphics are spectacular and you can definitely tell the evolution in technology with all the options of what can be done in these newer games in comparison to the old game boy advance and other portable gaming devices.  No longer are the portable games stripped down, they are all full featured games that are the equivalent of those on full sized consoles and PC's.

UMD media is the format used for movies and games on the PSP.  Its like a miniature DVD, capable of holding a full game or a movie.  UMD's have a storage capacity of 1.8 gigabytes, which is a pretty sizable amount considering CD's only hold 650-700 megabytes.  But a full sized DVD can pack in 4.6 gigabytes of data, so this means they have to compress the movies down to fit on 1.8 gigs.  Obviously on a 4.3 inch screen you won't notice a loss in picture quality.  The other removable storage available is the Memory Stick PRO DUO.  I have read of some people buying the adapter meant for a Cellular phone, plugging it into the MemoryStick port on the PSP and getting it to read other formats of MemorySticks!

Built into the PSP is full capability of connecting to a Wireless Access Point.  You can assign static IP address or have it pull one down from your Wireless 802.11b/g router.  I did notice that it isn't able to connect using WPA-PSK, only WEP (wired equivalent privacy) or WAP's configured in permiscuous mode with no security.  Aside from that, anyone in the same range as your WAP can join in with their PSP playing the same game or you can join over the internet.  Another thing that is unknown to many is that the PSP is capable of browsing the web!  Its sort of a hidden feature of one of the games and you sort of got to do some hacking to get it to work but it is possible.  Meaning that eventually they could probably release some kind of mainstream browsing software for the PSP.  This opens up all kinds of possibilities, especially if it is able to support JAVA.  Customized applications, business apps, or whatever you can be hit over the internet.

With the built in USB port, the possibility of having a mouse and keyboard along with unlimited options on external devices exist.  The only thing that I don't see is external video output.  Maybe one of the ports is capable of transfering what is displayed on the built in screen, but if one exists I'm not aware of it.  I would love to be incorrect on this.

Release its flagship title for a newly released console, of course! This is exactly what Koei did with Dynasty Warriors for the PSP. Having established a great following with previous instalments on other consoles, the popular hack-and-slash game now finds itself among the launch titles for Sony's new generation handheld console. Not surprisingly, the game is very similar to the other Dynasty Warriors, but it's still an enjoyable game to engage if you're into action of this nature.

As in previous Dynasty Warriors games, gamers get to control various characters from the three kingdoms from, yes, you guessed it, the Romance of Three Kingdoms. You begin with fifteen characters, five from each kingdom, and each kingdom has its own story to progress. Of course, the characters have strengths and weaknesses, so choosing the one that represents you best is important, especially when you'll be spending a lot of time with him.

Apart from the main characters, you can bring along four officers with you into the battlefield. Again, each officer has his own unique abilities. Some provides healing. Some allows power boosts. Others make you move faster. You get the drill. Allocating the right ones is, once again, a personal choice depending on your playing style. For the record, I read somewhere that there are more than 200 officers in the game, so it could take quite a while before you can unlock them all. If you're a completist, don't be surprised to find yourself spending a lot of time on this game just to make officers appear on your menu. The Wi-Fi ability on the PSP also allows you to trade officers with your friends if you get tired of who is on your list.

Capturing a map in the story mode requires you to get from point A to point B, via a series of smaller areas. This is one of the main differences between the PSP version of the game and its previous versions. Obviously, Koei has taken the portability of the game into consideration, and has broken up the action into more scattered, but relatively shorter sections. Apart from an increased emphasis on strategies, the system actually serves as an incentive for players to play the game on the go. Maneuvering through a large battlefield may not be a viable choice when your train journey lasts only fifteen minutes. But to attack a small area that lasts for just a few minutes, and then save it and continue later? Why not? This makes it feasible for players to enjoy a little moment with the game without having to sweat over the prospect of ending the game abruptly when they reach their train station. If only all portable games are as thoughtful!

On more mundane issues, the gameplay is simple enough, even though simplicity usually means repetitive. You get the normal attack, charge and jump buttons, as well as a ""musou"" button, which allows you to do special attacks. Even though you also make use of the shoulder buttons, you'll spend most of your time with the four basic functions. Because of this, I've read many negative comments about the supposedly ""idiot-proof"" controls. I'm fine with it though, since it's easy enough to master instantly, and comfortable enough to use throughout the game.

The game is not without its flaws. In fact, there are quite a number of them. One of them is the occasional slowdown in frame rate. The slowdown doesn't interfere too badly with the gameplay, but if you're paying good money for the game, you'd expect better. Another issue with the game lies in its less than user-friendly camera angle. It's entirely possible to get yourself killed just because an enemy, who is just slightly out of the picture, is attacking you relentless while you're wondering where he is. Also, the problem with ""ghost"" characters is also evident here, as some characters appear on the screen later than other, even though they have been there all the time.

In summary, Dynasty Warriors should appeal to gamers who prefer a no-frills hack-and-slash. The controls are simple enough to allow anyone to pick it up and start right away, and the new battlefield system makes it possible to tackle specified areas without having to commit long hours just to clear a map. It's a pity that  the fundamental issues of the game are not entirely addressed, making the playing experience a little less satisfying. Still, if you're a fan of the action genre, you may be able to look beyond the flaws and get a good time out of this game.","Enjoyable, but it could be better",1120089600,16,{'Platform:': ' No Operating System'},

For a now 6 yr old game i still play this one( ive owned about 3 yrs), so i would say it has replay value. I run a pc with an i7 processor, 8 gb of ram, 1gb vid card and a raid 0 HDD. i run this game on full settings and i will have a 5-8 thousand troops battle and no lag. I have version 1.4 of the game and it still has a few bugs but they are mostly annoying and all have work arounds. The graphics are ok, one thing people have to realize in a strat game is its not a FPS. You don't have a tiny area that loads around your character. You have stuff going on and moving constantly on a large map. So using cutting edge FPS graphics will actually just lag up most PCs. They are good for a strat game though.

Managing an economy is always part of the Stronghold series. Alot of people complain about this especially the new features such as gong and criminals. They act like their is some big problem with having to manage these. Its not hard to manage. All you have to do is:

* Put one falconers post near your grannery for rats.
* Place one gong pit near your stockpile. gong accumulates in high traffic areas. You may need a second or third one  depending how your estate is laid out. You place these in locations your first gong collector won't pick up gong at. The direction your pit is facing matters as the collector will look in that direction.
* Build a courthouse and tortures guild. Also some torture equipment. I usually build two  that don't require the torturer( stocks and cage) and 2 that are just torture and 2 that are cap punishment.  Then place guard post. Placement matters. If you build properly and put all your houses together (I do mine like a steet facing each other). Then you put a guard post at the end of the ""street"" . The guard needs to face the row of houses( the latern on the post needs to face the direction of traffic).  It is very important that all traffic walks in front of the guard and not behind him. Place your other one at the grannery so the guard can see the door of the grannery.

Thats all you do to manage these 3.

* You can use the inn church and double rations  and max out your tax rate and still have like 6 gong piles/rats/criminals. Their are other ways to increase popularity as well. Plenty of ways to increase popularity even if you don't do a good job with managing the above.

This game has two minor cons and one major.

Minor #1: Getting troops to do what you want isn't always easy. Sometimes troops are difficult to manage in battle. I advise playing battles on a slower pace( you can adjust it from barely moving to moving fast and you can do this while the game is running). Otherwise you will lose a lot of troops trying to get them to do what you want while being shot at.

Minor #2: Everything instabuilds. I can instabuild a tower right before an enemy gets in range. Everything just poofs onto the map once you place it. I would like to see some building going on like in settlers. It would also add to the strategy if you had workers that were vulnerable to attack building a tower or wall. It would add a lot to the gameplay.

Major #1: The AI is totally stupid. No really it has the IQ of your typical house plant. One of the worse AIs i have ever seen. I developed a work around for it though. Its not as good as them making a proper AI but it works. First, in map editor, i build my enemies estates the way i want them. I build them as if they were mine. I then place all the guards, archers, traps, etc. I make their estate fully functional( this takes some practice as you have to know everything that is needed and in what quantity so they don't run out). Then i add events to the mission. First either a time for me to win or to kill lord(s)x,y,z,etc. Then i set up invasion points( on the map). I then create invasions against myself. I usually start these at 5-10 years so i can build up properly first. I add several invasions. Each one is bigger and all repeat  every so many months. What this does is increase the difficulty as you go. The invasions will start to overlap And sometimes you will get 2-3 invasions within 5 minutes.  You can use a combination of the map editor and the mission editor for that map to make the game as difficult or easy as you want. Then i have to try to kill my heavily fortified enemy while constantly fending off my own invasions( which seem randomish to me since i cant remember when im going to be invaded). NOTE: This is the only way i have seen you can get the enemy to siege you( which is more fun than seiging the enemy).

In order to play this game you must like managing an economy. If you don't like resource gathering and managing an economy do not buy this game because its nearly required( unless you just make two big armies in the map editor and clash them together). Their really isn't any micro managing. All the buildings run by themselves. Really once placed you just have to make sure your supply chains are balanced with the final output. IE: You have to many wheat farms and not enough bakers/millers so your stockpile is full of wheat and flour. OR Your inn is running out of  barrels of ale because you don't have enough brewers or hop farms. The amount of supply you need for most things depend on your population so they need some minor adjustment. You should haven't a problem managing  an economy between even often attacks unless you got the game set really fast. In which case slow it down. I slow it down when i do most of building( in the beginning) and then speed it up  once im up and running.

This game is worth the current price though. If you like these types of games you will get hours and hours  of play and replay out it. Like i said im still playing it 3 yrs after i bought it.",Not as bad as the reviews say.,1315785600,3,,

By golly, I do it because I want to see how they play out.  (Not to mention the pride in ""creating"" a cool game for myself or others - knowing full well the makers of the map editors are the real champs.)

RPG Maker 3, bless its little heart, falls short in so many different ways that I only have a meager recommendation for the title.  The negatives are too great to mention (like having what seem like 64-bit graphics instead of 512 or awkward interfaces and character movements), even for folks like me who cherish this line of ""work.""

However, here comes my bleak recommendation...

I will support all things associated with classic RPGs until the day I die.  In fact, it was Final Fantasy that inspired me to do this sort of thing.  My dream is to make an old school, Final Fantasy-quality RPG some day.  RPG Maker 3 is the next step to do that shy of dropping cash to get an advanced education, a new PC, new skills, and programming software and books.

So in reality, my recommendation is that you support all things RPG, trying to find ways to make them popular in today's society.  (Obviously we RPGers are a small number, comparatively speaking.)  But titles like RPG Maker 3 are our voice in this world of fast-button-pushing video games that seem to corner the U.S. market.

This title was made for us, even if it can't compare to Final Fantasy 1 through 12 (no matter how good you are with it).

In all reality, if you love classic RPGs, you will like RPG Maker 3.  To love it would require a different desire regarding RPGs, I would think.  But your creative imagination will not decrease from utilizing this product, however, and RPG is the name of the game.  This one is for us, good or bad.","Aw, shucks...",1166400000,7,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 2'},

The game starts of with a cutscene of the meeting with all the gangs. The gang leader of the Riffs, Cyrus, is giving a speech. He is talking of unity between all the gangs. Then, all of a suddenly, you see someone pull out a gun and shoot Cyrus dead.

The game then flashes back to 3 months prior to the meeting. You are playing as Rembrant, the newest member of the Warriors. You learn the controls and most of the major aspects of the game. You learn brutal combos, ""Rage"" moves, how to steal car stereos, pick locks of stores, mug people, throw items, uncuff fellow gang members, and tag other gangs territory. Now your on your way to becoming the baddest gang in New York City.

This may sound like a typical Rockstar game but believe me it is not. You have a main objective that you must complete and bonus objectives that help you unlock additional things. And its not like all you do is beat people up and move on. Your main objective may be to outrun a gang(Baseball Furies), cause a cetain amount of destruction(Hi-Hats' art gallery), tag a certain amount of territories(Boppers), or earn a certain amount of money. Oh, and if that doesn't sound good enough you can do everything in the game co-op. That's right, the entire campaign mode can be played co-op, but the only drawback is that it goes split-screen once you get too far from each other. But you can control your our screen so its not that bad.

Now that's just the campaign mode, you can also unlock missions to see how each gang member joined the Warriors. It will first start off as a cutscene but then you can play as that gang member as he goes through his initiation process.

This game also has its fair share of ""minigames"". You can do a wheelcahair race. King of the Hill and Survival mode. Duke it out with rival gangs and many other things.

Last but not least, you can leave the Warriors hangout and just screw around GTA-style. You can do all the things mentioned above, but get caught doing it around the cops and then the fun beings. If the cops catch you mugging, breaking and entering, vandalizing, or assaulting an officer then they chase you. Fighting cops while people are watching is another no-no. The witnesses will run to the nearest payphone and call more cops. Sounds fun right? It is.",One of the Best Brawlers of All-Time,1133136000,7,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

The QB vision allows the player to make passes high, low, or anywhere they want the ball to be thrown to the reciever. The best part of the game is the Superstar mode. You start as a NFL prospect then you make your way to the top of the NFL.

Breakdown:

Graphics: 5/5 I've seen a big improvement in the graphics department of Madden 06. The player models look excellent and the faces are well done.

Sound: 5/5 Once again, the sound in Madden does it again. You can hear onfield voices and the commentary with John Madden and Al Michaels makes you feel like you are on Monday Night Football. Every year the soundtrack on Madden gets better and better. This year they hit the target again. Fallout Boy and Avenged Sevenfold just to name a few.

Controls: 5/5 The controls haven't changed in Madden 06 except for the QB vision. The controls make Madden pretty easy to get into.

Fun: 4/5 This is the department where Madden falls. Ok, Ok, overall its fun in franchise and superstar mode, but online it is literally impossible to win.

Pros:
12-hour talk time is for real. I played a 14-hour COD4 marathon and didn't run out of power until hour 14.
Noise canceling is excellent. No echoes when listening, and doesn't register my breathing! Comes with a wall charger, and can also be charged via USB with the same cable as your controller. It can be worn on the left or right side, and has it's own mute/volume control.

Cons:
While I think it's comfortable, there is no adjustment for the behind the head loop. If this is for a younger person, or if your head is just small then it may not fit too well.
The earpiece is heavy (must be that 12 hr battery) and wants to slide down if you move around. Without any way to adjust the way it fits this is NOT a headset made for walking down the street, it's for stationary use. The head loop is  also cheap feeling compared to the earpiece. It begs careful handling because of the springy feel and how thin the plastic is. Also, you will have to pair it again after you use the wall charger, but not when you use USB. Strange, no?

OF course the setting is still set on EASY. Granted, Level 2 still needs to be overcome (who knows what glorious descruction awaits?)- the controller has been easily customized to fit the more familar shooting style of MOH and this 41 year-old. All that aside, this violent, vulgar (F bombs drop frequently)action packed first person shooter is addictive and provides serious adult escapism for the sake of itself.

There is nothing morally redeemable about the game. It is all about killing. It is the type of game both Liberals and Conservatives rail against and that makes it all the more appealing.

The graphics are moody, stark and realistic. The sound design is subtle and layered and the action is swift, brutal and non-stop. The game features music worthy of a motion picture, the voice acting is fine (interesting how one of the ""soldiers"" sounds eerily similar to George W Bush) The body count is high. Sometimes the environment is a bit difficult to navigate through (just keep checking for landmarks when restarting) and the enemies are wearing body armor- so be prepared to unload a clip of AK-47 in order to eliminate the target. This game does take a good deal of time to get the hang of (at least for novice gamers).

3,True,"01 14, 2006",A3VBWZJ1BRMSQZ,B00095LEC4,Cyrus,"I could break this down, but why repeat what has already been said?  Sportduke's review of June 19, 2005 basically says close to what I would have said if I took the time to dissect this more carefully.  I have owned at one time or another every Medal of Honor or Call of Duty game and have beaten all of them pretty easily, all on hard mode.

I do like some aspects of the game.  I usually play stand-a-lone but recently my brother-in-law was visiting and we spent hours blowing each other up in the multi-player levels.  That was a lot of fun!  (Hmmm...maybe the Jack Daniels had something to do with it as well?)

The missions themselves are OK, but on some levels (Russian Front) I found myself running out of ammo, and then getting blown away trying to find the ammo that shows up when you knock off an enemy soldier.  Yeah, crouching and ducking work well, but when you are out of ammo, butting an enemy (who, by the way, has a loaded weapon) on the head with your rifle stock will only get you so far.  I notice the enemy soldiers never seem to run out of ammo!

My squad was basically a nuisance.  I did note that now and then they would actually clear out enemies, but I spent most of my time positioning them behind me to keep the stupid-so-and-so's from running in front of machine gun fire.  Healing them took up precious first aid kits and I really didn't see much value in keeping them alive (I think I did so out of guilt).  At the very final level they walk with you to the bunker, then disappear.  Thanks guys!

The ""adrenaline"" feature was of minor use.  I don't think it was fair that if I lost one of my lives, my ""adrenaline"" went with it, leaving me to start popping at enemy soldiers until I could build it back up.

The lack of save points is my biggest gripe.  I kept getting to the end of the game, that bunker on the final level, where in seconds I would go through all my ""extra"" lives and first-aid kits and still not have a chance.  Then, it would be back to the start of the mission.  No thanks.

WarioWare and Pac Pix were clever, unique and fun, and now along comes another classic icon: Kirby. Once again, the transition to touch-screen is made in fine style, with a delicious mix of challenge, fun, and creativity.

The control is everything that the DS will eventually become famous for: intuitive, fresh, and perfectly executed. Although it mainly consists of drawing lines and tapping objects, you can use these techniques in innumerable ways. Dead-on physics are also a helpful touch: the more steep your lines are, the more speed Kirby needs to reach the top.

Level design is flat-out brilliant. While some stages look similar, each one requires different skills and strategies. Unlike the GBA Kirby games, real brainpower is needed to figure out what to do. It's made even more deep by the fact that you can absorb enemy's abilities to get by certain obstacles. Often, you'll need to get a certain power, and then carefully avoid losing it until you get to the area where it's usable. Not that it's all head over heart; there are plenty of moments where pure speed and a precise hand will rule the day. It doesn't take uber-gaming skills, but you can't just mindlessly run through it either.

The main game is a pretty quick play, but like WarioWare, the true fun is in the extras. By looking carefully around stages, completing time trials, or finishing a level with a minimal amount of drawing, you can earn up to 250 medals. Collecting them becomes insanely addictive, and is a meaty, satisfying challenge without being overly frustrating (I only consider myself an above-average gamer, but I still managed to get 231 of them). And they're not just for show: you can spend them on new songs, extra life bars, different-colored ink, and even extra characters.

Game Informer hit the nail on the head: if you invested in a DS, you must purchase a copy of this. Perfect for a quick 15-minute session or a 2-hour marathon, and offering something to trigger-happy speed demons and quick-witted thinkers alike, Kirby's latest excursion is the very definition of fun.",Another A+ DS title,1122681600,6,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

When I sat down to play it, I noticed it had a certain quality to it that sets apart from other games. The problem is, there are a lot of things that this game lacked to make it completely amazing.

First of all, the protagonist Jack. Um, what can I say? He's a 16 year old twit who doesn't know when to shut his mouth at times. Sure he says some amusing things, but there are times he really needed to watch his mouth to avoid sounding like a complete idiot. There is also one specific part in the game where he truly bungles as a hero. I won't reveal it to avoid spoiling it for anyone yet to play this game, but trust me: you'll know it when you see it. Jack needed the most work done to his personality to make him seem more like he should have been. The female lead Ridley turned out much better than him, if only due to her two character themes and more interesting personality.

Second, the story, which is the game's biggest gripe from many RPG fans. There are far too many holes in the plot and overall structure of its consistency to satisfy a gamer. Many things that needed explanations didn't get them. It came off as a stale and contrived story of prejudice between humans and nonhumans, but the problems between us and them never get solved throughout the course of the so-called story. Many of us think to ourselves after the credits roll, ""That's it?""

Third, the battle system. Well, this didn't turn out too bad except that, as many have said, it's mostly hack n' slash. The designers also made a habit of giving Volty Blasts (the special attacks you can do when the Volty Gauge hits 100 in battle) to a very small range of characters. It seems like only major characters received one, and these are characters you can't obtain easily by any means. That means Volty Blasts fall on Jack's shoulders, who thankfully has four different ones (depending on what weapon he has equipped) to create variety; otherwise a lot of gamers make get sick of seeing the same one from one single character. It is cool that if you set up the right attack styles and time your attacks right, you can pull off an amazing number of combo hits, but it's hard because you have to choose characters whose moves complement one another's attacks (which is difficult due to the low number of attack styles most of the others have). Also, the AI for the allies doesn't seem to be as bright as one would hope. You can give them orders to do things like back off or heal a friend, but it's not very efficient.

Four, the music. Well, Noriyuki Iwadare of Grandia/Lunar fame did this game's music and that would make one expect to hear a great soundtrack right? Well, it's half and half here. The songs you hear in this game are actually pieces that Iwadare wasn't planning on using for Grandia 3, which he was planning better music for at the time. I guess you could call it ""recycled jazz,"" because that's what it tends to sound like. Don't get me wrong, the standard battle theme and powerful boss theme scream of his legendary ability, but that's really not enough to call this a great musical score. On an interesting note, he remixed some of Motoi Sakuraba's special boss music from Star Ocean 3 for the extra dungeon's boss fights. Star Ocean fans will recognize which tunes they are.

Okay, I griped enough about the flaws. There are good points to this game. First, the character models and environments. The characters are drawn in anime style and the landscapes use a superb range of lush colors to capture the many different terrains of Tottaus. Second, the recruitment drive. At first, you can recruit either humans or nonhumans to Jack's cause until a certain part of the story's time constraint, but after that point, you can only recruit allies from one race. Since the story splits into two differing parts, you will be tempted to play again and see how the other half goes. Plus, the recruiting actually gets addictive after a while as you may want to just grab everyone you can before the branch off in the story. There is a reward for those of you who get every single human and nonhuman in the Friends book, but it may not feel very rewarding.

All and all, I would give this game at least a B+ for effort. It's good, but not good enough. The main character, the story and the somewhat choppy battle system need some improvements. This game has a decent fun factor, but it leaves much to be desired.",An Interesting Game,1139184000,,,

Here's why people give this game bad reviews, aside for having no middle action, looking for a colossi is sometimes a pain because you are guided by a single line of light which ""points"" in the direction of the colossi, but actually looking for him requires patient, trial and error will make you wander the vast, yes, QUITE VAST, terrain where all the colossi are.

One thing that was nice, was the fact that your webs had to catch onto buildings in order to swing. This might not seem like a big thing in todays age, but the Spider-man games were notorious for just letting your webs stick to the clouds. You could swing all over the city, even if you were higher than any of the other buildings in the vicinity.

Levels - Planets: There are some levels that are the same in both games (hoth, Endor, Theed) but most of the levels in Battlefront 2 are completely new. There are levels like the death star, and fellucia, that you'd never see in the first game. There are many other new levels in the game. The only level I wish they hadn't put in the new game is Jabba's Palace because there are monsters everywhere that kill you after about 5 seconds.

Characters: Once again, many of the characters are the same, but there are also many new ones. Also you can be Yoda, han solo, chewbocca, mace windu, darth vader, and obi wan if you get enough kills. In the first game, you could only be soldiers and pilots.

Vehicles: There are many new vehicles as well. Some of the old vehicles are the same but have different weapons and abilities. In this game vehicles can overheat if you use the weapons too fast. The ATATs have 2 weapons instead of 1 in this game.

4,False,"04 14, 2012",A2YRK2XNXALLKQ,B0009OGJ02,T-ACCT,"At first I hated Sonic CD. It looked like Sonic 1 on a CD with a cheap time travel gimmick thrown in, but I started to enjoy it. It is not nearly as good as Sonic 3 and Knuckles or Sonic 2, but it is still good. The time travel adds a lot of variety.
Reviewing each aspect of Sonic CD:

Level Design

Palmtree Panic- 8/10: YAY! Although I prefer Green Hill Zone, this is quite nice. Travelling to the past made the entire zone prehistoric. Travelling to the bad future had all of the trees burning.

Collision Chaos- 7/10: Collision Chaos is obviously a redo of Sonic 1's Spring Yard Zone. Everything bounces Sonic into the air, which can be frustrating.

Tidal Tempest- 7/10: Guess what? This one is another knockoff! This one feels exactly like Labyrinth Zone from Sonic 1.

Quartz Quadrant- 6/10: Finally, a zone that does not copy Sonic 1, and as a result is not half bad.

Wacky Workbench- 5/10: AHHHH! You can not touch the zone's bottom or it will either zap Sonic or bounce him up and out of control! I don't know how I beat this, but it is not too bad. At least this is something original that I have not seen in any other Sonic game.

Stardust Speedway- 9/10: This is best zone in the game. Spotlights beam, water reflects the buildings, and it felt really relaxing.

Metallic Madness- 8/10: The biggest maze ever. Sonic shrinks for some reason, and the traps are extreme. The second act forces you to move right when the level starts or Sonic will be crushed by giant pillars.

That is every level in the game. Pretty interesting even if some feel ported directly from Sonic 1.

Graphics- 7/10: It looks like Sonic 1, and did not impress me at first. But then the backgrounds started impressing me. They were animated and gave the zones a lot of depth. Stardust Speedway had spotlights in the background that shined on Sonic.  I noticed Wacky Workbench had flickering lights at the top of the level. Little things like that made a difference in my opinion.

Plot- 6/10: Many people on Amazon said it had no plotline, but it does. Every 100 years Little Planet comes over Time Lake, and then it is possible to travel time. Sonic and Amy go to check it out, but Eggman has chained up Little Planet! Sonic to the rescue! It was interesting because you see Amy at the end of Palmtree Panic. Amy then follows Sonic to Collision Chaos where Metal Sonic kidnaps her. Then Sonic saves Amy at the end of Stardust Speedway and they kiss and run off to Metallic Madness.

Bosses- 6/10: The Eggman fights were not Sonic CD's strong point. I only liked 3/7 of the fights. Of course I have to include Metal Sonic, he was pretty awesome and challenging. It took me 1 hour to beat him.

Japanese Soundtrack- 10/10: This is the best part of the game. Catchy music. Palmtree Panic opens with a ""YAY!"". If you get to the bad future of Palmtree Panic it opens with a groan followed by drill sounds. Tidal Tempest had running water in the theme. Stardust Speedway was all about record scratches and jazz. Metallic Madness even had a short voclaized rap sequence.

USA Soundtrack- 7/10: So Sega thought ""HEY! This is too catchy!"" and changed the entire soundtrack for the US. I like the Japanese version better, but the US one focused on tracks that fit the themes better and had more rock. It is interesting how one zone can have a completly different mode when it's track is changed. Stardust Speedway was all about techno power over in Japan, but in the US its theme was more relaxed and balanced, which made the zone seem calmer.

Overall, Sonic CD is not my favorite. Sometimes it looks as if Sega could fit the levels in a cartridge. The game is pretty decent, however. Time travel gives a lot of variety and makes it different from Sonic 1. I recommend that you get the downloadable version that was released for Xbox, PS3, iPhone, and Android. That port allows you to choose between the American and Japanese soundtrack.",I keep modifying the review... Sonic CD is certinaly not that bad once you get used to it.,1334361600,,,

Logic3's attachable speaker setup is excellent, but not loud enough.  When I came across this outstanding deal for Logitech's PlayGear for such a bargin price, I decided to give it a try.  One word sums up the purchase: Wow!  These are some fantastic sounding speakers.  Even better than those I'm using for my computer.  Putting the sound level up to full blast, the room I was in was filled with music on par to that of a top-notch portable stereo.  Even better is that the unit can be used for your computer or MP3 player or CD player.  Also, it comes with a nice 12"" zipper-closing, square nylon case to hold the speakers, cords and power adapter.  The only thing I don't like about the unit is the cradle used for holding the PSP.  It isn't stable enough.  It's good as long as the viewer is keeping the whole unit centralized in one spot.  If Logitech had made it so the PSP could clip onto the main body of the unit, then it would be very easy to carry it around.

Then comes this new version after all this time. I will give them credit for the graphics. Everything is just outright gorgeous. However, I am guessing that is where they spent all of their time because the game is too easy at best.  As long as you can press the fire button fast enough, you breeze right through.

There are no secret passages to find. The game guides you where it wants you to go and you cannot take a wrong turn. You can purchase fighting abilities that allow you different moves, but everything is so easy, I found myself rarely using any of them. There were so little moves anyway with the Wizard, I had them all purchased within the first hour of gameply. There are no potions to buy, no keys to find to open chests, and so on. You literally just walk through the game pressing the ""A"" button as many times as you can. It takes nothing more than that.

Anyway, for long time Gauntlet fans, I think you will be disappointed. The previous version was a little easy, but what made up for that was the length of the game and all the little secret places and definately all the different characters. This version only has 4.

Again, the graphics are so much better, but you can take a nap while playing and still be able to finish the game. Yes, even on the so-called hardest level. I put the game in and had all seven levels done, by myself mind you, in 6.5 hours and I was taking my time thinking there actually might be secret passages. The final beast is just way too easy.

IT IS!!! This is THE MOST immersive Zelda game since Ocharina of Time!! Just the little details itself make this game in an entire league of it's own from the other games!

Little details like, when Link is riding Epona you can actually see him pulling on the reigns not just sitting there and letting the horse do all the work. There are almost zero glitches when it comes to body parts sinking into walls, as well as the game gives you a sense of time with the constant coming and going of the days! As well as appropriate music changes for every time of day!

There is SO MUCH you can do in Twilight Princess!! You are not limited to following an exact path of where to go! You can play the game for HOURS trying new things and finding new things within the world without even having to complete a temple! You can discover caves and new routes through Hyrule field! Like you could in Majoras Mask and whatnot but the world is so gigantic there is almost unlimited possibilities!!

The story line of the game is much like all the others, working your way through different temples getting a little something out of each one to complete your final goal.

All the characters like Ganon, princess zelda and a few other characters come back as well as introducing new characters like Minda a nimph-like creature who helps Link throughout his quest. Places from Ocharina of Time are brought back as well, in greater quality and realism, like Hyrule Field, Karakiko Village and other places as well.

I have to say first that every time I go to play this game I laugh my fool head off for the first ten minutes or so. I play a lot of video games (as you might imagine) and many of them have a driving aspect. A key skill I've honed over time is how to drive quickly, instinctively, while avoiding crashes. It is REALLY hard for me to switch to this game where you're often trying to ram head-on into your opponent. I will be racing down the road and literally keep missing the cars I'm trying to hit, because my hands automatically dodge left and right!

Once you get the hang of the smashing, the game is a lot of fun. It's really easy, too. I never have to look at the manual - it's just a matter of grabbing a car, choosing a weapons configuration, hopping into a map and smashing away. It's a great stress relief. You have arcade mode which are one-off maps as well as career mode to build up your skills and vehicles over time. They have a lot of vehicle choices, color choices, and interesting maps. There's a lot to enjoy here if you like smashing things with cars.

They did a good job with the environment. You can smash into other cars of course, but you can also run down cafe tables, take down light poles and telephone poles, even smash your way through buildings. The whole world disintegrates around you. Blast into a full gasoline tanker truck and watch it go up in a huge fireball.

The rewind feature builds up over time and lets you ""backtrack"" after a wrong turn or a head-on collision. It's great fun and helps you extend your time, undoing a mistake.

There are multiplayer modes too, where you can play with people either locally on your system or online with XBox Live.

Yes, other racing games might have more ""perfect"" car models and racing response, but that's not really what Full Auto is about.

As of the time of this writing, I have had the console for about a year and I regularly play approximately zero PS3 games. When the console first came out, I purchased Rainbow Six: Vegas and The Darkness, but quickly grew disinterested in both (Vegas primarily for its extreme difficulty level and The Darkness purely because I didn't like it). I soon afterwards picked up The Simpsons Game but casually played that on and off for a while before my interest was drawn away by other games. Another near-immediate pickup for me was the ""next gen"" version of NCAA Football 08, which SEVERELY disappointed me because I saw a game where the graphics were stepped up phenomenally, but all of the little things in the game that I found to be fun, such as the pennants to unlock stadiums and historic teams, were missing. After a mere couple of hours with the PS3 version, I went back to the store to purchase a copy of the PS2 version. My latest item acquired for the PS3 is The Bourne Conspiracy, a prequel to the Bourne novels and movies. This game seems very promising in the early stages, not becuase of it's shiny new graphics, but because for the first time that I can remember seeing, an action game proudly displays and excels at its hand-to-hand combat.

My biggest complaint about the PS3 was the supposed saving-grace for the system: Grand Theft Auto IV. I won't spare you the details here about everything I posted in my review, I'll just say that the game was a waste of time, I gave it a 5.4 out of 10 rating, and I have abandoned the thought of purchasing any GTA games in the future. Rockstar claimed that IV was going to reinvent the franchise in the way that GTA III reinvented it ... not quite. If it wasn't for the upcoming God of War III, ""Hitman 5"" (the unofficial name of it so far), Resident Evil 5, and Splinter Cell: Conviction, my PS3 would be on sale.

I've also noticed Sony nickel and diming the hell out of their consumers through the use of this system. It confuses me that a company that was so highly praised for the PS2 being 100% backwards compatible with PS One games, controllers, and memory cards would completely take away some of those features. First off, you can transfer your saves, but you need to purchase a special adapter to do so. As far as the controllers go, they're about as useless as that one you dropped while your friends were over and you still had pizza grease on your hands and it never quite worked the same afterwards. They don't even sell an adapter for the controllers. While in *unnamed store* today, I saw that the controllers had jumped five dollars since the launch of the console.

Overall, I have had almost no fun with this system and the $60 price tag on games which have just about all turned out to be busts for me so far isn't going to turn me on to the system anytime soon.",The cost of disappointment is $500,1213142400,3,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

Most of consumers will be skeptic of purchasing a 599 gaming system, so here are the reasons I took before making the plunge, maybe you'll find similarities that might help you.

1. Considering getting a gaming system: if you take the affordable Wii out of the equation, you only have two choices left: XBox 360 and PS3. The both have great support, but if gaming is all you're looking for, the XBox has a more powerful processor than the PS3. You can do some research to find more information about this topic, even though Sony claims their ""cell"" processor is faster. The PS3 on the other hand, has a built in 60 GB hard drive, that can be easily upgraded in the future with any HD. A limitation I found in the PS3 is that it does not save any extra memory so you can background do stuff (such as downloading while you play), and Xbox does. So, as far as gaming, Xbox has an advantage (and consider that they have been in the market for a while, so upgrades will arrive soon). However, if you thing that 399 is cheaper for the Xbox, thing again... this takes me to point no 2.

2. Blu Ray player. The PS3 is simply the most affordable Blu-Ray player on the market, with great reviews. The question you should be asking yourself is Do I even care for the Blu-ray technology? Or am I happy with my DVD's? Do I have the rest of the necessary equipment to enjoy an HD experience? (HD TV, a decent sound system, etc). If you do like the new features, the PS3 will deliver the goods. If you plan to get the same thing on the XBox, consider this: if you get the 399 version you still have to add an HD-DVD player that is sold separately for 199. Plus, the current systems don't have an HDMI 1080i/p output, so you won't be able to match the PS3. And, accordingly to some studies, Blu-ray discs are outselling HD-DVD's 2 to 1. However, Warner Bros. is coming out with a new disc called THD (Total HD), which will support both formats in a single disc. Nice to keep in mind.

3. Support and Exclusive titles. PS3 titles are growing, but it would take a while to match up with the current XBox game line up, plus, you've got to consider the games you like most: Halo, Gran Turismo, F1; for some titles are sold specifically for a single system.

I recommend doing some research on the topics that interest you the most, the price tag is always an issue, but is not that high when you understand why, and the other options you have.

5,False,"04 17, 2012",AHNT97DWEAQUY,B0009VXBAQ,Amazon Customer,"As the greatness that is the Nintendo Wii comes upon the twilight of it's lifecycle, I have to reflect a bit over what the system has done for me.  I'm a man in my early thirties now, so when I grew up, I grew up on Nintendo.  Sure, there was a bit of Atari action going on a little before that, but when Mario presented his mustached self, I never looked back. That very fact alone has a lot to do with the fondness I now look over Nintendo's latest incarnation; the Wii.  Much has been made over the years about how it's the lesser of the next gen consoles, what with it's subpar graphics and kiddie games.  All of us Nintendo lovers have had to put up with the scene where one of our acquaintances who loves to play Call of Duty asks us if we play on XBox live and we respond, ""No, we have a Wii.""  Suddenly we can see the person begin to look down their noses at us as they begin to talk in a fake superior British accents about how they're sorry that we're stuck with an inferior gaming system and suddenly I feel like I have to apologize that my gaming doesn't fit their standards of gaming.

That's when I have to stop myself, look them in the eye and say ""Yep, stinks to be me.  All those hours of fun I've had playing Mario Galaxies and Zelda and Metroid Primes have obviously been a huge waste of my valuable gaming time.  I see the light.""  Pause to let the sarcasm sink in and go about my business.  Perhaps fire Mario Kart up when I get home.  The point is simply this, going in we knew the Wii wasn't going to have knock out realistic HD graphics.  And frankly, we didn't care.  We believed in Nintendo because of years of top quality games.  The motion controls are fun on the games that do get them right, but if they aren't your thing, most of the time you don't have to use them.  I myself think the motion controls are pretty cool.  Unfortunately, a lot of games didn't realize how to incorporate them and you ended up with a lot of games that degenerated into waggle fests.  But you pick up a game like Metroid Prime 3, where motion controls take an already awesome gaming experience and shoots it to the next level, then it was worth it.

Sure, we saw a lot of sewage drenched filth come out on the system and had to wade through a lot of uninspired junk to find some jewels.  But when we did, wow, how refreshing was it to play those games.  This is an incarnation of Nintendo that has seen three top tier Mario Games, two Legend of Zeldas, and two Metroids.  How many generations of Nintendo consoles can boast that, apart from the original?  And graphics?  They may not have been photo realistic, but the good games that knew how to work with them and give us good art design with vibrant colors really looked great.  Take a look at the Galaxy Marios or even Mario Kart.  You could play a new Ghostbusters game on PS3 or XBox 360 that looked like you were watching a movie, or you could play a version on the Wii that looked like a slick cartoon that made you FEEL like a Ghostbuster.

To me, that's what makes the Wii a success.  The fun of the games.  And yes, they weren't all kiddie games.  Try out the bloody No More Heroes or MadWorld and you'll find some slick no small kids allowed violence you'll be shocked to find on a Nintendo system.  Even first person shooters; while missing the photo real HD graphics, they control like a dream with the Wiimote/Nunchuck combo.  Point and shoot.  Super accurate.  Not everybody is a ""hardcore"" super gamer.  There are some, like me, that grew up on the Nintendo brand that love those original games and love to play the continuation of those series.  And when you throw a game changer like the Wii Sports games, it's like icing on the cake.

You can also get a bit of exercise with some of the games and it gets your butt off the couch.

  On the other hand, the Wii has terrible graphics when compared to the Xbox 360 or PS3.  The graphics are not ""next gen"" and are comparable to the Gamecube.  All that said, the Wii can be very fun though, like Wii sports for example...for a few hours...When I was playing it, I just kept thinking, ""I can't wait until they make these sports games with better graphics and better gameplay"".  You aren't given the option to field in the Wii baseball for example, which was disapointing.

With having and playing a Wii, another problem is going to be the height of which your TV is to your eyes.  When I stood up to play the Wii Sports, (which you really need to stand up to play to get the fun out of it) I was looking down a little at my TV, because my TV is not eye level when I stand up, which caused me to have my neck pretty much bent down the whole time I was playing, which was flat out annoying and uncomfortable.  I'll have to somehow prop up my TV, so it sits higher up.  What a pain...

As a gamer, just having the Wii, doesn't cut it.  Thats why I own a Xbox 360.  I want ""next gen"" graphics and a very good on-line play setup that the Wii lacks!  Wii has on-line play, but compared to Xbox's ""Live"", its extremely primitive.

3 Stars Overall, for being a very fun console and the wiimote motion sensing is very intuative and new for a game system, but the Wii is lacking ""next gen"" graphics, and does not have a very good on-line play setup like Xbox's ""Live"" or PS3's ""Home"".  In no way is the Wii worth $250.

These are just the basics of the game, you don't have to read:

When you first start, the game gives you a walk-through, which is good because that way, you don't have to keep looking in the manual, and if you miss something, you can always look in the books (i mean in the game). You get to name your dog and you can teach it to come when you call their name through the mic., as well as commands. There are the standard commands (sit, lie down, roll over, etc.) and then there are other commands you can teach your dog, like hi-5. You buy food, drinks and shampoo for your dog along with brushes. (The brushes and shampoo depend on whether your puppy has short or long hair) As you progress in the game you can buy more dogs although you can only keep three with you, if you get more you have to put them in a puppy hotel, which i don't like about the game. There are three types of contests to enter your dog into. When you walk them, your puppies may find objects to either wear or play with, or just to sell for more money. Some of the objects are neat though, like you can find a Mario hat while out on a walk that your puppy can wear or a Princess Peach kart based on Mario Kart (this specific kart is exclusive to lab and friends) that your dogs can play with. Plus your dog can meet a friend's dog with Wi-Fi Connection in Bark Mode.

The game is fun for a while but then it gets sort of boring but that's just my opinion. I don't like how you have to care for them every once in a while so they don't run away and there's no possible way to shut them off. Although they are adorable this game can get boring.

3,False,"10 25, 2006",A2TUCS8O6AJXKJ,B0009Z3K9O,--,"""Castlevania: Curse of Darkness"" is a game that fails in two very important areas. First of all, it does very little to improve upon the formula of its predecessor, ""Lament of Innocence"" -- and there was already a lot of room for improvement. Second, and of equal importance, is the fact that it fails to evoke the ""Castlevania"" brand nine times out of ten. With little in the way of nostalgia going for it to longtime vets of the Konami series, and very little to offer that's new in any way, it's very nearly a bust.

Fortunately, there is something to be said for mindless hacking and slashing. This ""Curse of Darkness"" has in great supply. Combat is frequent, fast, furious, and smoothly animated. The controls are highly responsive, making for some excellent arcade-like battle sequences. Enemies are many and varied, and far more memorable than their ""Lament"" counterparts, and this is true of boss encounters as well. Here, at least, the developers decided to take the initiative and move forward a few steps.

Level designs remain unchanged since ""Lament,"" however. The flat, narrow and generally unadorned corridors were one of that game's greatest flaws -- and the same is true of ""Nanobreaker,"" another Konami effort from the same producers. You might rightfully expect something to have been done about this after two games were fashioned of the same broken mold, but you would be mistaken if you were to assume as much. Although the environments are diverse and strive to have their own gothic personality, each one is basically the same as the last once you move beyond the aesthetics. Even though ""Curse"" offers more outdoor areas, they are merely a novelty, as they are designed in the exact same fashion as all those halls and corridors. The word ""linear"" doesn't even begin to cover it.

One unique gameplay element unique to ""Curse"" are summoned creatures called Innocent Devils. The game makes much ado about them, and they do prove useful during the course of the campaign, but they certainly don't revolutionize the gameplay inherent in the series. In fact, their presence gives ""Curse"" more of a generic fantasy vibe than one of ""Castlevania"" origins.

This just doesn't feel like ""Castlevania."" For all its faults, at least ""Lament"" managed a few real nostalgic moments. Not so here, apart from some returning enemies and a soundtrack that pays homage to the Nintendo originals. A good storyline might have gone a long way to make this game better than the sum of all its parts, but no such luck here either. The new hero character, the Forgemaster Hector, is brash and unlikable, the actor portraying him always screaming his lines. To make matters worse, it's the usual anime fluff about slain girlfriends, rival peers, and a desire for vengeance... which makes it virtually identical the plot of its predecessor.

Unless you loved ""Lament,"" there's very little reason to go out of your way to play ""Curse."" Even longtime ""Castlevania"" enthusiasts aren't guaranteed a good time here. That said, if you have a space in your schedule between ""Devil May Cry"" games and don't mind some mindless hacking and slashing, you could do a lot worse. It just so happens, however, that you could do much better. Konami really needs to dig deeper than this if they want the franchise to survive for another decade or more.","Second Verse, Same as the First...",1161734400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

There's no better way than to bring this game with you on car trips, standing in line waiting for your morning cup of coffee, or anywhere you have spare time.

Although the game lacks any real ""ending"" to it, there's much to see and do in the village you create. Fishing, planting trees and flowers, hunting bugs and fossils, or just hanging out in your own pad. Many who have played Animal Crossing on the Gamecube will be pleased with this portable translation.

Graphics aren't really stellar here, but still very colorful and adequate.

I can say that I wasn't impressed simply because there was no depth, but I knew that the game certainly could be a great one. Metroid Prime for the Gamecube, to me, was not a very good game. Hard-to-use controls, single player only, a lot of backtracking... and so on. This game has backtracking, but it has easy controls and great multiplayer. Here is my review:

PROs: Great singleplayer and multiplayer, best DS graphics ever, little lag suprisingly, cool characters, WiFi, stat counting... so on.

CONs: Have to unlock the hunters ( not too hard, just play single player ) , occasional lag, grainy sound sometimes, repetitious adventure mode.

Graphics: 10/10. Byfar the best graphics ever shoved into a DS game. They are unbelievable. It's pretty amazing that the whole game was packed into this, let alone the great looking graphics. Very, very nice.

Sound: 9.5/10. Very good on surround sound. The only real problem for sound (for me) is that it's grainy; but it could be my DS. You hear footsteps, the creature's noises... everything works nicely.

Control: 9/10. Good controls, but it could be some quick corpal tunnel syndrome. I play with the stylus and my hands kind of get cramped up using this tiny little DS. It's not too bad, but I sometimes have to take breaks.

Fun: 9.5/10. Excellent WiFi, great graphics, and basically the Halo of handhelds, this game has everything any FPS fan would want. Even though the adventure mode is tedious, the multiplayer is great and anyone can hop in and have a great time with this game. Hell, if you have no one to play with, practice with bots. This game is the best on the DS, and I have no intentions of putting this game down any time soon; and I don't think you will either once you pick it up. Go buy MPH now. NOW NOW NOW!!

Here are some hints on how to get through the game:

If you're on a long fall to the ground, jump right before you're about to hit the ground; no health lost.

To get all the hunters, play single player and get 22% through the game. ( I believe. ) You will have 50% of the Octaliths by this time as well.

Special attacks:

Samus: Guided missle
Kanden: Electric balls; dissorient enemy
Trace: Invisability + Sniper
Noxus: Freeze
Spire: Ball of fire grenade launcher
Weavel: Grenade-Launcher like green bomb
Sylux: Electrical weapon

You get to direct your squad throughout the city of Mexico over the course of a few days.  If you're looking for a Call of Duty type go in shooting ask questions later approach that doesn't work in this type of game which I do enjoy a change of pace because Recon makes you map out your approach and there are too many corners within the city to ignore possible enemy locations.

Pros:

-excellent community if playing with players over the age of 20.

-addicting strategic battle system

-intricate and easy crafting system.

-great amount of battleplanning and mob hunting.

-excellent graphics even for a dated game, runs great on most PCs.

-Great variety in amount of jobs being able to play; three new jobs are expected withthe upcoming expansion.

-Was the best PC online RPG out on the market before World of Warcraft was on.

Cons:

- Flawed party system.  You must party in order to gain experience and level.

- Time consuming game.  After level 70 you must quest in order to get to higher level areas to fight.  Quests are hard to find and aren't always successful.

-  Time consuming to get items.  Crafting system, while easy, is not cost effective early on, which means you lose money, and are always broke.

-  experience parties don't get any good drops, which means you must quest for decent no-drop items.  These quests consume more of your time.

-  Flaming community sites.  While playonline doesn't run an official forum on their website, allakhazam and killingifrit do.  They are quite possibly the least moderated and most flamed forums I've ever seem.

- Higher levels (level 75 is capped) have a huge demand on artifact 2 gear, and crimson gear.  You must quest, quest quest, every day for at least two months in order to get all the gear you need.  This also means you need to go to areas like sky, ballista, dynamis and various other NM hotspots as well.  You also must help out your linkshell teammates get their items too, which wastes even more of your time.

-  After level 60, expect to be playing this game at least 4-5 hours a day if you want to get anywhere.  Want to join an exp party or run dynamis with guild mates?  Cancel your plans with your friends tonight, you're not going anywhere.

My overall opinion:

20% of FFXI population left for World of Warcraft.  Most of them never came back.  I was hard headed and stayed the course in FFXI, never realizing how much time I wasted in this game until I was 75 with nothing to do except lot for gear and fight end-game.

This game is so very time consuming.  You have to be glued to your computer in order to play in the higher levels.  Lower levels were a lot more fun, no commitments, all parties.  This game has become corrupt though from all the inflation of prices on the servers, bad community kids, and level 75 newbies who use bots in order to get high level mob pulls before everyone else.

Want to know what being a high level in this game is like?  Imagine standing around for three hours waiting to pull a monster that has a 30% chance of dropping an item you might need.

4,False,"10 18, 2005",APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000AB603U,JD,"When I sat down with Age of Empires 3 I was hoping for a little more - something new and refreshingly different (ala the Lord of the Rings RTS for example).  There is a new feature, the Home City.  The rest of Age of Empires 3 is the same as the previous games at heart, with some new makeup and some new units.  Don't get me wrong, this new Age of Empires installment is fun and just as addictive as its predecessors, but also feels tired at the same time.  If you still enjoy the previous Age of Empires games, you will likely enjoy this one equally.

It has been some time since I played the previous Age of Empires 2 but I remembered a simple, relatively clean interface.  In Age of Empires 3 I was a little taken aback by the clutter of information, and juggling Home City shipments (and Deck Building) with what was happening on screen requires a lot of micro-management.

This new installment has some great civilizations and in this regard, the units are new and refreshing.  In an Age of exploration and the shift from archeic weapons to gunpowder, you have a variety of new units, and a few units that are unique to each civilization to help set them apart.  In addition each civilization has its own unique advantages (and disadvantages) that set it apart from the rest.  This is primarily done via a new feature:  the Home City and the shipments you are allowed to send from it.  I liked the idea of the Home City, but wasn't overly impressed with some aspects of its implementation.

The new units are fun and consist of both modern (for the period) and archeic units giving you some flexibility in what you want to field - however don't expect their power to be equal.  The cannon physics are really well done, you can track cannon balls throughout their flight and watch the havoc they bestow upon enemy buildings (which now fall apart in peices instead of as a whole) or the holes they punch in rows of infantry.  The charachter animations on most units are really well done, and occasionally you will see them adjust their weapons for long range of short range combat (they throw burning items at enemy buildings instead of firing their highly ineffective muskets).  I beleive that musketeers can also fix bayonets to make them more effective at close range, although I didn't notice a signifigant difference, mine continued to fire their muskets regardless of the range of the enemy.

There is another new feature in Age of Empires 3 in the form of an Explorer.  He is a powerful unit you can use to explore the map (although any unit can still do his job).  The Explorer can take damage, and fall in battle, but doesn't die.  He can be rescued and revived.  The Explorer has the special ability to deal with treasure guardians in one shot, but a hardy group of soldiers can also take down the treasure guardians without too much difficulty.  The Explorer can retreive treasure found on the map and can also build Trading Posts (settlers can build them as well) - this is how you interact with the Native Americans.  Building a Trading Post near a Native American outpost forges an alliance with them and you are then allowed to train Native American warriors which are useful because they don't count against your population limit - but they do have a population limit of their own (15 seems to be the norm).  In a bizarre twist, the Native Americans are not hostile to these new invaders unless they are allied with one of your enemy players - intersting.

In summation, I did enjoy trying out Age of Empires 3.  My initial impression was that the civilizations and corrosponding diversity in units and Home City shipments helped add some variety to the Age of Empires format, but also meant more added juggling.  Even with the new ability to zoom in and out a little, I still found it difficult at times to juggle my units.  In combat, my nicely organized ranks merged into one wave of units that were impossible to divide up and thus made tactics difficult.  You can assign numbers (via Ctl+#) to a group of units to help this, but I didn't find anyway to assign formations to the units (you could do this in Age of Empires 2).  When left idle long enough - seeemed to take a long time - my units did auto-arrange themselves into formation, but didn't maintain that formation during attacks.  I wish they would have borrowed a little from another RTS game that allows you to train units in groups that are then treated as one unit.  This would have made Cavalry and Infantry units that much easier to manage, especially in large numbers.  In addition, in that same RTS game you can assign different unit types to merge together and form a new formation of units that is again treated as one unit.  This greatly simplifies training units and then moving them about the map and maintaining formations for attacks.

I do look forward to spending a lot more time with Age of Empires 3 as I'm sure there is a lot that I haven't noted in my initial observations.  I think the game is true to its heritage and I think that Age of Empires fans will flock to this new installment.  However, I don't think that Age of Empires 3 delivers enough new variety in either design or implementation to steal away the fans of other RTS games that are working to reinvent and revitalize the genre.",A successful installment in the Age of Empires Saga,1129593600,336,,

Control: 6.5/10. This game also proves that the PSP would be a lot better if it just had that extra analog nub. There are a lot of different ways to change the controls for this game, but they take time to get used to, and even a SWBF/SWBF2 console player would have to get used to these controls.

Fun: 6.5/10. Star Wars Battlefront 2 for the PSP does some things right, but most things wrong. If you are a Star Wars fan, rent this game, but if you have a PS2, Xbox, or PC, definitely just buy that version instead; unless you want Star Wars on the road.

4,False,"12 29, 2009",A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000ANYFW6,JJ,"This was my first ""Sims"" game ever.  I got this even before I bought the PC version.  When I got it, I loved it, but now that I can compare it to other ""Sims"" games, I realize that it really shouldn't be called a ""Sims"" game.

Story-A millionare named Daddy Bigbucks is directing and producing a reality TV show that features a desert town called Strangetown.  The catch is that nobody in the town knows about the show.  You are an actor/actress that Daddy Bigbucks has hired to make things run smoothly in town.

Graphics-The graphics are much better than the previous ""Sims"" games for the GBA.  The characters are bigger, and there are noticable differences in height, weight, etc. in the characters (but you can't choose your height/weight).  The graphics aren't perfect, but they are really pretty good.

Sound-The music is not bad.  I personally liked it.  The voice acting (what little there is) is nice.

Gameplay-This is why I took off one star.  Although the gameplay is extremely fun, it is not the gameplay of a ""Sims"" game.  You have 3 seasons of the reality show, and in each season, there are about 4 episodes.  Each episode has different tasks for you to do.  For instance ""Aliens Arrived"" features tasks in which you try to prevent an alien invasion where in ""Blackout"" you try to find out who or what caused the mysterious blackout all over Strangetown.  It is not freeplay at all, it is very specific in what you have to do.  You can, however, decorate your house to your liking, but the game only allows about 20 items in the house before it says you can't place any more.  Character intereaction is strange.  First of all, only certain characters are in each episode, and the way you interact with them is just luck.  You have 2-5 social options, and you just pick one hoping that they will react positively to it.  For instance, for a friendly conversation you might be able to Chat, Entertain, or Hug, but they might reject your hug and accept your chat.  It's all very random.  There are 5 jobs in this game, and like all other GBA games, the jobs are minigames.  There is everything from a casino minigame of Go Fish to a flying game at the mountain.  There are various locations to explore from the zoo to the farm to downtown.  It's really a wide variety of locations.

Fun-I thought (and I still do think) that this is a really fun game.  It isn't a ""Sims"" game, but it is a really fun game anyway.  By the way, you can play the episodes as many times as you want, so there is a tad bit of freeplay.

Length-Playing all episodes probably takes 12 hours, but I play them over and over again, so I got my money's worth.  However, if you just want to play them once and get it over with, pay no more than $15.

Overall, I am really glad that I got this game, and I love playing it.  Die-hard ""Sims"" fans will probably be disappointed, but I think it's a great game with a fun story.","Not really a ""Sims"" game, but it is still really fun",1262044800,,,

5,True,"06 13, 2011",A1VHSQP16HLT0C,B000AX224Y,Lucas Black,"In a world where handheld consoles keep getting more powerful, they sure don't keep getting smaller.  The original Nintendo DS was pretty huge, hardly pocket sized.  And even the DSi which I also own will fill a pocket and create a large, blocky outline.  Sony's PSP offering is thinner but also longer and has that large, easily-scratched screen.  When considering a handheld gaming device, one has to consider portability almost at the top of the list.  The Micro was designed to perfectly fit that task.  Sure, the Gameboy Advance is essentially a dead console considering companies no longer make new games for it, but there's still a trove of gems out there to be bought, and often very cheap on the used market.  That leaves the machine itself.  It's tiny, but still perfectly handy.  Your thumbs might cramp up if you hold it a certain way, but if you keep them straight over the face of the machine it's not an issue.  The screen is small, but the colors are so crisp and the screen so bright (adjustable to be dimmer if playing in a dark room) that you hardly notice unless you play it right next to someone playing a GBA game on a DS.

The modular faceplate design is especially smart, because if you get more scratches on the screen than you'd like, simply remove the faceplate and put on another one.  With this ability, your screen can stay essentially perfect indefinitely.  It also lets you change the look of your machine.  Perhaps: silver for dressy occasions, camouflage for outdoor activities and sports, red for playing at home... or just whichever color you like most.

The Micro has a headphone jack for headphones (unlike the GBA SP), which is advisable because the tiny speaker holes can be easily covered with your thumb, and the speaker is honestly not very powerful.  The on-off switch is recessed well into the bottom of the machine so as to not be hit accidentally unlike some GBA/DS iterations (I'm looking at you, original DS...) but the volume/brightness control is button-based, rather than operated with a slider, so volume/brightness can't be changed with the unit off.  As for negative aspects of the Micro, the shoulder tabs are operated by buttons hidden underneath that are located closer to the middle of the unit than the corners, so one has to place their index fingers farther over the tops of the corners to reliably actuate them, unlike in units like the DSi where simply tapping on the very corners will suffice.  This will often not be a problem, but it's worth noting.

Overall the Gameboy Micro is an excellent choice for a handheld console, even in an age of technically superior ones.  Finally a portable unit that I can actually take everywhere.  If you plan on buying a handheld to be used primarily on-the-go, this might be the best option.  If you almost always play handhelds at home anyway, you may as well go for a DS Lite, DSi XL (and in a few months when mroe games come out, the 3DS) or PSP.",Could be the perfect handheld game machine,1307923200,4,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

It took action games back to their side-scrolling roots while introducing a flavor not tasted by gamers for years with its simple but difficult fighting. With the third VJ game, Viewtiful Joe: Double Trouble, the touch screen features and audio downfalls of the DS console really hurt the experience.

The fighting concept remains the same: use Joe's ""viewtiful"" powers to eliminate enemies to live through progressively harder levels until the game is done. The only problem with the otherwise fun gameplay is that these V-Powers aren't as fun to use on the DS. The slow-down function seems to slow the frame rate far too much, the scratch feature isn't important enough to use unless it's forced, the slide feature is annoying and touchy, and the swipe function doesn't serve a big enough purpose to make it stand out. All of the moves that involve touching (which includes the swiping and sliding) are difficult and annoying to implement into fighting because they require you to take your fingers off of the action buttons and onto the touch screen.

Another problem with VJ:DT is that the levels are repetitive, long, and far too frustrating at certain points. This might have been passable on a console, but it's not as easy to get by with such problems on a handheld. If I'm getting mad at a handheld game, I'm gonna swap it for something else. That's all there is to it.

Still, the old-school gameplay and graphic styles return from the Gamecube/Playstation 2 titles, and because of that, Viewtiful Joe fans will definitely want to give this a try. Everyone else should try Mario Kart DS or Castlevania instead.",Not as Viewtiful,1132272000,7,,

4,False,"04 17, 2008",A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000B69E9G,Stephen B. O&#039;Blenis,"Resident Evil 4 - which is actually somthing like the 15th game under the Resident Evil banner, but the fourth of what are considered the 'main' games - takes a definate turn away from its predecessors but manages to keep itself firmly within the established action-horror mode of the rest of the series.  Rather than a new outbreak of T-virus-spawned undead, the zombies are actually absent entirely this time around, and familiar trademarks like Raccoon City and the Umbrella Corporation get brief mention.  The new enemy is spawned by a parasitic lifeform called Las Plagas, and though similar to the zombies in ways, is smarter and capable of mutating into progressively more inhuman forms as the game progresses.

  The setting for the game is that a college-aged girl named Ashley, daughter of the US president, has been kidnapped by a mysterious group called Los Illuminados.  The player takes on the role of Special Agent Leon Kennedy (who was in previous RE games), who's dispatched to a remote corner of an unnamed European country to follow up on a lead.  Following an attack at a small rural farmstead, in which assailants murder the two local policemen assigned to assist in the case, Leon, communicating with the US through a radio commlink, finds himself fighting his way through the forest towards more clues as to what's going on.

  The chief enemies, the ones that there are swarms of, are called Ganados, and are inhabitants of the countryside who've been infected with the parasites.  They fill the role of the zombies from the other games, attacking en masse, but smarter and working together.  Initially looking human, they use weapons like pitchforks, torches and chainsaws, but, on an individual basis, are clumsy and awkward (although capable of running).  More horrific Plaga-infected enemies are encountered later on, some of them mindless monstrosities and others talking, thinking members of the Los Illuminados hierarchy.  The games progresses through little villages, a large quarry, castle settings, a deadly lake, and other such locales.  Allies are encountered but you generally don't get to play as them.  The exception is Ashley herself, who becomes the playable character a couple of times.  The game winds through a cool progression of battle scenarios, sinister envirornments, puzzling out secrets and discovering the history and intentions of Los Illuminados and the Las Plagas.  The Las Plagas themselves turn out more interesting than one might think, for what, at first, seems to be just a microscopic parasite wielded by a shadowy organization to create an obediant army.  Very good story unfolding, although I personally found the finale, in some ways, a bit anticlimatic (although the as-the-end-credits-roll glimpse back at the village, very peaceful and idyllic before the parasites arrived, adds a potent touch).

  There are the usual kind of flaws in reasoning that you often get in games like this, that would be terrible flaws in a movie or book but aren't as bad in a video game, i.e. the character can carry around an absurd amount of weapons and supplies without being visibly loaded down; you can be almost killed by terrible injuries but healed instantly by a first-aid spray, etc.  These really make no sense and are just put in to make a game more fun.  You could have the character just carry a single gun and quite a large ammount of ammo and it would be far more realistic, but it's more interesting to be able to have your character switch between pistol, uzi, shotgun, mine-thrower, etc. as the situation calls for it.  Some games have found ways around the flaws in logic by making the healing items magical and thus more potent, by letting the character only carry a smaller amount of stuff but letting him/her build up a stockpile of it in a location that can be accessed frequently (such as shifting items back and forth between the 'normal' world and its 'nightmarish world' counterpart like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Hill-4-The-Room/dp/B0001Y7404/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Hill 4:  The Room</a>&nbsp;did), others just let it go like Res. Evil 4 does.  In most ways, I, and probably a lot of other players, like for a game like the Resident Evils to try and be plausible, but the things like 'how much can the character carry' just don't do that much harm to the game even when they're not believable (now it would get really annoying if the Resident Evil Movies let characters each carry an arsenal on their backs and in their pockets).  The prescence of the arms dealer, roaming at will through the game without the Los Illuminados seeming to mind, is also rather unrealistic, but there he is, waiting for you to buy weapons and sell treasures you've uncovered.

  Once beating the game once, you unlock bonuses, including three separate mini-games.  In two of these, you play as Ada Wong, off on her own missions through Illuminado territory; one of them shows how certain unexplained events in the main game unfold, although it's a question of individual preference whether these should have been explained or left as mysteries.  In the third, you start off with Leon and proceed to unlock 4 other characters, who you can send on timed missions where you just try to rack up points by wiping out as many enemies as you can before your evac chopper arrives; there are 4 different locales to be played through in this one and its non-story, points-oriented style is a nice contrast to the rest of the game.

  Good graphics, good gameplay, a nice playing length where you don't end up running through the whole thing in way too short a time, and better voice acting than some of the other (primarily early) games in the series all add up to help make this one nice package.

5,False,"01 2, 2006",A2ZYHROYENYYKK,B000B6ML28,Irunnoft,"Project Gotham Racing 3 is easily the best racing game I've ever played - period! I've been a lukewarm fan of racing games until this game came along. Until PGR 3, my favorite racing game was the Need For Speed franchise. However, I hated NFS Underground. There was just too much stuff that interfered with actually getting to race for my liking. Perhaps it shows my age, but I wasn't all that interested in tricking out my car. To me, it felt like NFS lost a great deal in the transition from Hot Pursuit to Underground. I enjoyed Hot Pursuit but one of my biggest gripes was the sheer amount of time it took before I could purchase/unlock the game's pinnacle vehicle: the McClaren F1. By the time I got to that point, all the fun had been sucked out of the game and replaced with the single-minded purpose of just ""racking up points"" in order to unlock that car. Once achieved, I felt less than enthusiastic about continuing to play the game. Of course, my son came along and wiped all the saved data off the memory chip for the Gamecube (the console we played on prior to the Xbox 360) and after that, I've not played the game since.

When considering whether or not to purchase the Xbox 360, I saw the exotic car porn that was the trailer for the PGR 3 game on a 360 kiosk. Like everyone who saw the trailer, I was mesmerized by the sheer graphic rendering of the vehicles. It was very impressive! I wondered if, like so many movies, the best of what I'd seen was simply that from the trailer. How many times have you been to a movie only to discover that the best parts of the movie were the parts cut and used for the trailer? Not so with this game. In fact, you can't really begin to access the best features of PGR 3 until you buy the game.

Unlike every other racing game I've ever played, you start the game with an impressive array of cars available. These cars are ones you would normally have to work up to in other racing games. You start out with amazing cars. PGR 3 got this part right! You get to hit the ground running in this game!

After you select your first car and put it in your garage, you can start a number of races almost immediately. You can begin your solo career, go online or even system link with other 360 consoles. This is a very welcome feature to me. I don't like to have to go through a bunch of screens and jump through a bunch of hoops just to race. Sometimes I just want to pop the game in and burn rubber. PGR 3 lets you do just that, if you so desire. Of course, you can take as much time as you like before you begin a race.

One really great feature to this game is the availability to ""test drive"" any car. On other games, you may be able to see a ghost image of a car that will be available once you achieve a set number of points, but you can never really see any details about those cars. Not so on PGR 3. You can see every car that the game has to offer with the exception of concept cars that only become available after a set number of kudos points have been awarded. Sure you may start with 85,000 credits, but you can look at the Ferrari F50 GT and even test drive it! Yep, that's right! You can test drive any car on the test track - even if you don't have nearly enough points to buy it! It can let you know what you might want to work your way up towards. Nice feature! Smart design!

When you play the game online, you have instant access to all the cars right then and there. Sure you may only have an NSX in your solo career, but race online and you can jump behind the wheel of a McClaren! That's a sweet touch! The online feature is fun beyond belief, too. It is fun to race against total strangers and there is a staggering number of types of races (street race, capture the track, elimination, team, etc.) to choose from. There are also an equally impressive number of race venues to choose from (New York, Las Vegas, Japan, etc.). The person who creates the race can also control certain aspects of that race for participants who log on. You can set the conditions to Day, Night, Overcast, force the racers to have the ""in car"" view, control the number of AI racers, etc.

One aspect that blew me away and that also reminded me of the kiosk trailer was the replay feature of this game. Once you complete a race, you have the option to continue on to the next race or to watch a replay of the race you just completed. If you're not in a hurry, watch the replay. Trust me on this. It is absolutely unbelievable! First of all, you can save the replay to watch again anytime you wish. This in and of itself is a really cool feature. If you have an unreal race and you want to show off, you can save the race and watch it ad nauseum! During that replay, you can also take a picture. This is just too cool! You can forward, reverse, pause or restart the replay, but once it is playing you can toggle to switch the camera angle and freeze the frame. From there, if you select to take a picture, you can literally zoom your camera in on the scene from every angle imaginable. The precise detail is jaw-dropping. It really is! You can do all kinds of things with this picture, too. The game provides you with several Photoshop-esque special effects. For instance, you can adjust the aperture of your picture and thereby produce blur to give the effect of high speed movement. You can change the color and take the picture anywhere from black and white to over-the-top vibrant. You can adjust the focus, the lighting, the brightness, the contrast, etc. Once you get the angle, the effect and the subject framed as you like it, you can take the picture and save it. Again, like the race replay, you can view it at any time.

The best feature of PGR 3 is the amount of control the game gives you right from the start. The graphics are amazing and, arguably, the best graphics during the game are had when racing from the in car view. There are several camera views you can choose from. Two from behind the car, one from inside the car, and two from the perspective of a camera that would be mounted on the front bumper of the car. I might have missed one or two, but you get the point. I prefer the in car view and I sometimes toggle to the behind the car view when I have to thread the needle between cones or archways. I wasn't the biggest fan of racing games because of all the roadblocks to enjoying the game that seemed to be part of the genre. PRG 3 has completely redefined this genre of game for me and has far exceeded my wildest expectations for what I thought this game would be.

Its a game that can be played by people of all skill levels and the simplicity of the swing types matched to buttons is something that I love.  The ""A"" button is a safe shot and will always be inside the strips, ""B"" is the Topspin shot, ""Y"" is the lob shot and ""X"" is a slice shot.  As you get advanced and used to playing the game, you can add in the Right Trigger button with the above shots to do advanced versions of each.

When You start out the game, you have minimal skills and ranked 200th in the world.  Each week of the season you can perform one of two or sometimes three actions.

You always have the option of training.  This will provide you with a short drill that changes based on type of training and the level.  The task ranges from serving to specific areas of the court to knocking over walls and bowling pens.  These can be quite fun in themselves and really don't take a lot of time.

The second action you can take is to participate in a tennis tournament.  These include small tournaments up to Grand slam events.  There are four levels of tournaments and each one gets progressively harder and more rewarding.  Some tournaments require your rank to be above a certain level or for you to go through a qualifying round.

The final action isn't always available but is often very beneficial.  I have seen challenges from Top Ranked Players, Fund Raisers and even managed to get invited to the National Team for my country!  After completing the fund raising challenge, I had the luxury of having a Tennis school named after me and was rewarded with several silver and gold stars!  These are used to increase your skills by first adding bronze, then silver and finally gold stars in increments of 10.

As you compete in tournaments, you'll start to achieve rank and earnings.  These will also unlock new coaches, sponsors and clothing that you can take advantage of during the course of your career.  Coaches allow different levels of training, sponsors offer you rewards for achieving certain milestones etc.

Multiplayer options include 2 player at the console or 2-4 on xbox live.  There are doubles matches, singles matches and several variations on tennis for playing with friends called ""party games""

All in all this version of Topspin is as good and even better than the original.  My only complaint is with the load times as there tends to be quite a bit of load screens in the game.

After Aura, I was very excited about this sequel, even with its many delays. I dutifully marked my calendar with every announced release date. Now I wished they'd kept it in the workshop longer and given us a better game.

Not that Sacred Rings is awful- it isn't. It follows the Aura storyline and your quest stays true to making the ring/tetrahedron gizmo and your world safe. You brave danger and the stereotypical goofy sidekick and scarred bad guy leader to save the day.

However, there are places where it needs more work. Look at the mountains or other background areas and you are likely to see unfinished square edges. Game technology must be more advanced than that.

The voicework is not bad, but the facial movements do not always match the words at all; it's as if they changed the dialog. (Perhaps this was originally made in another language?)

The puzzles are at times too simple- just enter the clue you found literally laying on the floor. On the other hand, there are some that you must guess what to do. A couple of times I gave up trying to figure out what the designers wanted and clicked randomly with success. More frequently, I turned to a walkthrough. There are a couple of very clever puzzles, too- I loved the candle one.

I dislike games where you must wander about, hoping to find what to do next, and that's what I found myself doing in Sacred Rings. For some gamers, though, this is part of the fun.

Having said that, now I'm going to complain that I wanted more room to wander. There's an part where you can access several areas, via a very, very cool tram (excellent graphics here!) I would have loved to explore more paths, but we are limited to just one path and destination.

As for the graphics, it was average. I rarely found myself stopping to admire the view. As I mentioned above, the view was not always worth looking at, anyway. Interior shots were nicely done with detail and colors. Other than one rainy world, movement in the areas you explore comes mainly from torches and a waterfall.

If you are prone to disorientation and dizziness from movement on the screen, be aware that if the cursor strays to the bottom of your field of vision, you will find yourself virtually spinning as if in a tornado.

The interface is easy: right click to access and leave your inventory. Hot spots are easy to find, so there's no pixel hunting. Alt/tab lets you leave the game (to check the walkthrough)

Overall, it was average, at best. If there had  been better graphics and puzzles, it would rate 4 stars. If you enjoyed Aura, you will want to play Sacred Rings.","OK, but not great.... worth playing, though.",1176768000,18,,
1,True,"03 30, 2006",A1RMGCJY22YIMZ,B000BC38LA,raginhood,"It's very hard to do this to Oblivion, but, I must be honest, this game isn't as much fun as Daggerfall or Morrowind duely based on a couple or three/four/five things.

First of all let me say for the most part if you have a mid/high end system the graphics are superb. As we well know though graphics alone do not make a great or fun game.

The initial parts are fun and quite challenging and to keep it mysterious for anyone still thinking about purchasing this I'm not going to go through them. I'm going to focus on what has made this game not fun for me and totally different from any other single player rpg I've ever played.

1) The PC UI is horrible totally horrible. It truely shows this game was made for the XBOX and ported over to the PC with XBOX controls, you have to go through several functions to get to the page of the game you want like inventory or journal etc. etc. There's no ability to ""set"" hotkeys to these function like you normally would with a PC where ""I"" = Inventory or ""M"" = Map or ""C"" equals character stats or ""J"" = journal etc etc. You are forced to use what the game offers you and must memorize and learn a console system to play a PC game.

2) This one takes the cake the scaled npc/mob leveling system where no matter what level you are the majority of the npc/mobs are the same level or better. If you happened to find something you think would be extremely tough at level 1 like a DRAGON guess what? It's level ONE also. Only a handful of things don't scale level with you, but, things like wolves have a counter part like timberwolves that will be your level. It's kind of funny when you level up something that was a wolf when you wake from leveling up will be a timberwolf just like that.

3) Instant guard omni-presence constantly. Those of you who enjoyed playing a theif in Morrowind are in for a shock and surprise this time around. If you so much as ""touch"" an item that is not yours and belongs to another, gang bang guard(s) are going to appear and cart you off to jail (unless you pay the fine). Also as a thief ""what you see is not what you get"" You may see some glass weapons, they look like they would bring a fortune and you go through all the trouble to steal them and get away only to find out you can't use them or they are an illusion and nothing more than a cardboard copy of the real thing.

4) Sadly just like npc/mobs LOOT also scales by your level in this game now. You can forget daedric armor or any decent armor/weapons for a long time, and it doesn't matter if you clear out what you think is the toughest dungeon you ever saw, if you ain't the right level yet, you are going to get trash from the drops and trash from the chests and things you have to use lockpicks to open.

It almost feels like many mmorpgs where you have level restrictions on weapons and armor,the only open endedness of this game is where you explore. Everything else is predetermined from the getgo to the end. Now in Everquest I enjoyed tweaking out my level 1 character in level 50 gear and then soloing through the game as far as I could. Well, you can forget that in Oblivion, you're only going to get and find stuff and fight stuff at your level period.

I'm certainly glad that the store I buy my games from has a 7 day return policy, because this one certainly went back before the 7 days were up. I know there are many out there that like this game (mostly xboxers), but, the PC version was horribly designed and the design elements of the game do not allow roleplaying or godlike characters to be created through their adventure. Sadly as you level up instead of things getting easier by your level everything gets harder because it's always equal. 45 arrows to kill one goblin is rather rediculous when you could kill the same goblin with 3 to 5 arrows at a much lower level. Stuff like that just makes this game a poor effort in the ""roleplaying"" minded aspects of it.",If it isn't fun it can't be good,1143676800,32,,
4,False,"10 23, 2005",A33693RRRFK55Q,B000BC1UZ6,B. Erickson,"There's just no way for that line NOT to be funny.

""Stubbs the Zombie"" reminds me in many ways of ""Destroy All Humans!""  Both are set in what's supposed to be the 1950's, although the technology encountered seems to be advanced beyond anything we have today.  Both feature B-movie monster archetypes as heroes, and the ""hook"" in both cases consists in the sociopathic glee of taking a bite out of humankind on their behalf.  Specifically, both games involve the wholesale harvesting of human brains, which is depicted pretty graphically (especially in ""Stubbs"" - DAH had to have green blood to secure its ""T"" rating).  But the gore is always in service to the comedy tone of these games, if only because of its ridiculous excess.  If you don't laugh at the demo reel off the main menu of ""Stubbs,"" which ends in a literal bloodbath of brain-eating, limb-severing quick cuts, this game might just not be your cup of ovaltine...lol.

Another comparison is that both are unfortunately extremely short.  ""Stubbs"" has a cooperative split-screen mode (as you have no doubt heard, it's built on the Halo engine), and if you play through with a friend, you'll have a lot of fun, but you'll probably beat the entire game in a couple hours on the default setting.  Even by yourself, it's maybe 5 hours tops.  There are no real ""extras,"" either.

That said, one of the reasons it's bound to go fast is just because it's so much fun.  For every human you kill either in the traditional brain-eating way, or by swiping them to death with your grisly meathooks, or by blowing them up with your guts that you hurl like hand grenades, or your head that you roll like a bowling ball, you earn an undead henchman to be used in your ongoing battle against the remaining humans.  This means that there's going to be a lot of spontaneous bloodshed happening all around you in a busy room, and if you find yourself in trouble, you can usually go to a quiet corner to recover (your ""health"" automatically recharges after a few seconds without a hit, again like DAH!) and let your zombies take care of things for a while.  In addition to the powers described above, you also have the ability to fart your enemies into a stupor, and to possess armed enemies with your severed hand and make use of traditional firepower in classic 3rd-person shooter fashion.  All of this, plus the ability to pilot some very obviously Halo-ish vehicles in certain areas, makes for more varied gameplay than you might expect from the first couple levels.  But again, it's hard not to feel like the whole thing's over too quickly.

I like this game and I'm glad I bought it, although I'll probably get sick of playing through the same levels with friends pretty quickly, as fun as it is.  Hopefully the game will really catch on and they'll release some new maps - I can think of a lot of obvious campy suggestions.  (The game isn't online enabled though, it's purely old-school co-op.)  I would definitely recommend renting before you buy, but you might wind up buying it anyway.  I don't see how it really matters whether you're a ""zombie fan,"" although if you're repulsed by over-the-top Blood and Gore, Crude Humor, Intense Violence, Sexual Themes, and Strong Language (""M"" rating criteria) - then what the hell are you even doing reading this??","""Stop Eating My Brain!""",1130025600,6,{'Platform:': ' Xbox'},

Ace Combat Assault Horizon for the PS3 left me bitterly disappointed, so I avoided the series for a while.  I finally took a chance and bought Ace Combat Zero, and am glad I did.

This particular installment includes features that I liked from Ace Combat 4 & 5.  Examples would be:  take offs and landings, a fairly good storyline, and, although it only occurs in two or three missions, the ability to fly back to base to rearm and repair damage to your aircraft.

in addition to all of the other things one can expect from an Ace Combat game, some things were changed or added.  For instance, depending on the difficulty you choose at the start of the game, different enemy ace pilots will face against you on sortie.  So when you play on one difficulty, an enemy ace might be in a F/A 18 Hornet, and have a cool and controlled demeanor during his/her interview.  Whereas playing on a higher difficulty will have you face an ace flying a Eurofighter Typhoon, and have a morbid and emotionally suppressed demeanor during his/her interview, so this adds some replay factor.

I heartily recommend this game to Ace Combat fans.  To newcomers, I would recommend starting with Ace Combat 4.  If you like it, then consider getting Ace Combat 5, and then this game.

So with all the hype and after playing the demo I was still a little unsure and was bracing myself for a mediocre game. Once I loaded EAW up I was hooked. I played the single-player story campaign all weekend long (24 hours straight) and have not even gotten into the MP and campaign modes. The gameplay had so many options on how to play unlike any other RTS before it. EAW gave me a unique way to play the game in every mode. All hail Petroglyph and may we have many many more RTS games from you in the future. Don't forget to download the latest patch, it has new maps and a new galactic conquest campaign.

Jameson Thottam cannot put into words what this does for the Star Wars universe. Finally, after years of waiting, we get a game that is worthy of the Star Wars Name. The Gameplay on this game is truely amazing. You are thrust into the Star Wars universe, amist a massive Galactic Civil War, a war between bitter rivals, the noble Rebel Alliance to restore the Republic and the powerful Empire. You suddenly find your self in the control of one of the two factions, the fate of the galaxy is in your hands. Also, the multiplayer is just amazing. Very few games have this level of multiplayer. I love it.

If you have ever played Star Wars Rebellion you will love this game, if you have never played Star Wars Rebellion you need to get that game first, I, Jameson Thottam, base all my opinions of any game onto that game. The gameplay of EaW is very intense, fast paced, but very fun. Space battles are gorgeous.

However, there are some cons: First off this game is still $50.00 it was released too long ago to still be $50.00, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is only $15.00 at CompUsa so if you are low on cash get SC:CT instead of Star Wars Empire at War and maybe, just maybe LucasArts will drop the price.

Also, a new expansion (Forces of Corruption) has just been announced with tons of new stuff. Even more reason to get this game.

Since i don't have a 60 or even a level 50 yet so i don't exactly qualify for a total complete package review. However since I am playing one of the two new races offered in the game I can offer atleast a review on the opposite side of the spectrum.

First i didn't suffer a single installation or gameplay issues. I bought the game on the midnight it was officially released and I was able to install the game and jump right in on one of the new player vs envoirment servers. I am playing the new blood elf race offered for the horde which brings with it the Paladin class previously only available for the Alliance faction in the game.

The blood elf starting areas have almost jaw-dropping graphics associated with. It almost looks like the graphic engine was given an upgrade. The blood elf capital city of Silvermoon is perhaps the best looking city in the entire game even surpassing even the former champion Stormwind(the capital city of the human race) in terms of scope and architecture. The quests are abundant, well-layed out and actually follows a story-line for anyone in intrested in reading the texts of the quests. Otherwise its still the same kill 20 things there or go deliver this to someone. However, even this mundane almost universal mmo questline is again made 'fun' by the casual and the patented fun gameplay associated with this Blizzard World of warcraft mmo. You will never feel bored or get a feeling of grinding(reptition) with these quests.

After grinding the first ten levels in the colorful, pretty and scenic starting areas you will be moved into the new lvl 10-20 areas for the blood elf caled Ghostlands. The scenery changes almost to a brooding, dark, errie and sometimes even scary landscape. Feels right in place to showcase devastation the scourge assault bought to the high evles now called the blood elfs within the lore of this game. They are again abundant quests here to take you all the way to lvl 21 or even 22 if you prefer to grind.

I have heard the same good stuff about the new Alliance race called Draenei which gives alliance access to the powerful Shaman class previously only avialable to the Horde faction. The Draenei also have orginal new areas as well their own hugely magnificent capital city called Exodar. You can expierience new content all the way to lvl 20 here.

From there on the lvl 20-58 gameplay reverts back to the orginal world of warcraft gameplay. To me its all worth it as i always was a fan of the horde faction at the same time my favourite class Paladin was locked out for me. Now with the new race Blood elf i can expierience Paladin without having to change factions. I hope the same will go for people playing the Shaman class for the first time with the alliance faction.

Burning crusade brings a host of new pvp content also but mostly for people in lvl 60+ located in the new continent called Outland. They have new world pvp in form of capturable spawn points or areas which gives powerful buffs to the wining faction. The other new world pvp content is the capture and hold of a real time city. One of the fun pvp aspect is being able to do aerial bombarding runs on the city defenses among the regular frontal assualt strategy. Last but not least is a new instanced Battleground called Eye of the Storm that have been introduced. Its combination of capture the flag and capture the hill scenarios.

So all in all two-thumbs way up for Blizz. They have come up with a worthy expansion to the world's leading mmo out there. I still predict that World of warcraft along with the expansion Burning Crusade will be the reigning champion in the world of mmo for many more years to come.",The expansion breathes new life into the game,1169769600,3,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

I think it's just fine as long as I set up the races myself and limit the number of Ai to about 8-10 (MOST tracks) but if you run the ""Challenges"" (which you need to do to make money to buy cars and unlock tracks) it is written to include as many as 23 Ai in some of them and the FPS can drop out the bottom when you need it the least.

Yes, GT""R"" will have some stutter now and then, but nothing like GT""L"" is doing on the same PC.  AND, with everything turned down too..

Even worse.. FPS swing from 80 to 10 while you're in a Challenge making it very hard to even finish a race let alone WIN.

Update:
5% CPU overclocking helped a bunch with smoothness.. but still has some slow downs now and then.  I'm sure latest video card would do wonders for it.

Update 2;

Pulled out the ATI 9800 pro and installed a GeForce 7600 GS OC 512mb card & doubled the RAM to 2GB
Just what it needed !  Runs well with lots of detail..

Gameplay:
BFME2 is what I would call a ""true real-time strategy game"".  In most RTS games (e.g. Starcraft, Age of Empires) you are really playing a ""real-time tactical game"".  You must focus a lot of effort on directing your troops at a micromanagement level, telling them who, exactly, they are supposed to shoot at, one guy at a time.

The BFME series has simplified this by creating ""batallions"".  Instead of building archers 1 at a time, you'll build them 15 at a time and they come out as an organized batallion.  You cannot tell your 15 archers to focus fire on 1 enemy unit, you can only tell them to fire on another batallion.  The details of how they direct their fire is up to them.  The time you aren't spending directing fire can now be spent on executing a bigger plan.

Consequently, BFME2 is one of the very few RTS games that rewards multi-pronged attacks and flanking.  Units get a flanking bonus for attacking enemies from behind and the fact that you don't need to babysit every single fight means you can leave one battle to go start up a second front somewhere else and not worry so much about the fight you aren't watching.

BFME2 also introduces a new resource model which greatly rewards map ownership.  Rather than fighting over piles of resources and ignoring the other 90% of the map like most RTS games, BFME2 has resource collection spread across the entire map.  The more you control, the more money you get.  Factions have been completely re-balanced to accomodate this -- in BFME1, the human teams could not match Mordor in an open land war but in BFME2, they can.  They need to, if they want any money!

Singleplayer:
BFME2 covers portions of the war that were not covered by the movies.  The first mission of the Good Campaign has you fighting off Goblins around Rivendell, for example.

Single player has 4 options:
- Skirmish, the usual you-vs-computer battle mode.
- Good Campaign.
- Evil Campaign.
- War of the Ring.  This is a new and improved version of the ""living world map"" they had in the first game.  They fleshed it out and now it's more like a free-form game of LOTR Risk.  You and the other players start off in various sections of middle earth and conquer the map any way you choose.  Battles can be resolved RTS style or automatically (Civilization style) and this mode also has multiplayer support (one War of the Ring game could take a very long time if you resolve every battle in RTS mode!)

Playable sides:
- Dwarves.  Dwarven units tend to be slow but tough.  They aren't big on cavalry but their infantry is very good.  They gather resources with mines and they can also use these mines for travelling -- enter one mine and pop out at any other mine, anywhere on the map!  This gives dwarves a good ability to hold ground once they've taken it.

- Goblins.  Similar to dwarves in that they can build mines and use them for travel.  Goblins are a ""spamarific"" species, though, with a lot of large batallions of inexpensive but brittle troops.  They do, however, have some very, very fast units and are excellent for hit-and-runs.

- Mordor.  Not entirely unlike the Mordor from BFME1, but minus the free troops.  Mordor has poor defenses and plays best as a very aggressive team.  As Mordor, you need to push your opponet early and keep pushing while you upgrade to better units and work on more resources.  Mordor lacks the mobility of the goblins and dwarves and lacks the speed of the elves but they do have a great ability to flood the map with orcs.

- Isengard.  Similar to the Isengard from the first game, you rely more on strong infantry with strong upgrades.  Similar to Mordor, this is a good team for someone who likes to take a strong offensive.  Warg Riders give Isengard some good cavalry but it's usually the Uruks that form the real destructive force of any army.

- Elves.  Elves are fast on their feet with especially good archers.  They can be played offensively or defensively with pretty good effectiveness.  Try to use your fast feet to keep the enemy pinned in while you build up for the kill, or play defensive and work on leveling up some of your powerful archer heroes.

- Men of the West.  This team is basically Gondor + Rohan from the original game.  Human infantry is pretty strong, especially in shield-wall mode and they can do a good job of soaking up damage while your archers do the real hurting.  Humans also have pretty much the best cavalry in the game, making them quite lethal at either hit-and-runs, or for backing up a strong infantry army.

Other new stuff:
This game adds ""stances"" and some new unit powers.  Stances allow all units in the game to decide if they want extra damage at the expense of lower armor, or higher armor at the expense of lower damage, or a balance.  Human Swordsmen in the defensive stance with shield wall activated are extremely tough.  If an enemy is banging on your buildings and ignoring your units, set your units to aggressive stance and teach them a lesson.

My first meeting with this series was Suikoden 3, which I enjoyed greatly.  Konami had made a definite effort to compete with the Final Fantasy series, and while they are different style games, the result for Konami was a genuinely compelling fantasy odyssey.  I was less thrilled with Suikoden 4, which was a step backward in technology with very flat characters and a plot that lacked the vastness of Suikoden 3.

So here comes Suikoden 5 which, strangely enough, has been simplified to the point of almost being a throwback to a PSOne game, lacking event the graphic finesse of its predecessor, but which is every bit as interesting a game as Suikoden 3.  Once you get past the lack of fine detail, you can't help but notice that the artistic design itself is excellent.  The plot is intricate, and the fight system is solid without being overwhelming.  And it's a very big world with plenty to look at and interact with.

If you haven't played a Suikoden game before, the underlying structure is political, and a good part of the game involves international and interpersonal relationships.  One of the keys to the games are the 108 stars - characters that must be found, recruited, and used during the fights and battles to come.  They must be trained, armed, and occasionally coddled in order to complete the game successfully.  You not only get to deal with the traditional hack and slash of traditional combat, you have to cope with a real time battle system.  When you're not doing that you can go on trading expeditions to make money.  And you will always need to make money.

This otherwise successful game has two flaws from my point of view.  I found the tactical warfare system difficult to work with.  I seemed to be getting the job done, but I was never sure what it was that I was doing right.  Another irritant is the number of random fights encountered in fields and dungeons.  When you are in the middle of trying to figure out a puzzle or a maze, getting interrupted every three steps can get on your nerves.

Over all, this was a game that far exceeded my initial impressions.  I contribute this to the complexity of many of the characters.  This kept up the flow of surprises that make a game interesting.  I'd play it again some day.",Castle Building For Fun And Profit,1153267200,25,,

I recently replayed the PS1 version and the game has held up wonderfully over the years, so I wanted to grab the PSP version to add to my collection of other PS1 to PSP ports because everyone knows the PSP is port/remake city. However, despite Sony's terrible decision NOT to release this (and Mega Man Legends 1/2) in the states (we apparently need a SIXTH version of FFIV but a second version of BOFIII is a no-go) this definitely deserved another release. Don't even get me started on my feelings towards Square-Enix anymore....

I'm here about the non-data, physical quality of this product. The copy of BOFIII I got (what I assume is the European's version of the greatest hits label) made me laugh with its ""quality."" I know they cut corners on reprints (actually, I try and avoid Greatest Hits versions of anything because of that, and it was stupid of me to buy this blind, I'll have to go on eBay and get an original print) but we can't even put the UMD logo on the UMD?

Do any of you out there remember the terrible and utter failures that Games Workshop computer games used to be? Remember Space hulk for playstation? Remember Epic 40k for Windows 95? Remember Fire Warrior for PS2? Remember Rise of the Horned Rat for Playstation?

If you do, you have my condolences.

This game, however, is not only a good Warhammer 40K game. Its a good game PERIOD. Loads of fun, and if you're a Warhammer 40K nut like myself, utterly faithful to the source material.

Its an old school RTS down to the roots; this hearkens back to Starcraft and the original Command and Conquer (and since Starcraft was a brutal ripoff of Warhammer 40K to begin with, its nice to see Games Workshop step back in the arena, if only to see what a REAL GW game should be like).

A few areas of game play could be better rounded; the learning curve is pretty steep for new players I've found, since instead of mining resources, you get 'requisition points' for holding and defending strategic nodes on the map. Players who like playing defensively will have a definite advantage while an aggressive player of Starcraft is gonna get pummelled before they learn thes ropes. There are also some serious balancing issues; the Imperial Guard are WAY too powerful and the eldar still don't stand a chance in the hot place where the guy with the pitchfork hangs out against certain other armies... But the intuitive control and insanely cool fighting animations(which are actually more than a silly chopping motions! The battles play out as actual BATTLES; there are times where the enemy will nab a strategic point from you because you're too engrossed in watching your tiny digital army duking it out with the bad guys)help round out the game to a nice, healthy digital shine of quality.

As a result I can say that I've fully enjoyed this version with two exceptions. The game freezes & the game's occasional spelling error. There's nothing more frustrating than getting to the middle of a day, only to discover that the game has frozen on you. The misspellings aren't really annoying more than they are funny, but since the HM series is fairly popular I can't understand why the translations weren't better edited.

The game play is fairly easy to get used to & is full of the typical fun that you should apparently expect from the HM series.

You might say this ""review"" is really more a commentary on how this game starts out from a NON-D&D GAMER's perspective. I am up to Chapter 2 in NWN2 and so have not finished. Still, a game's first chapter should be fun, right? No?

GOOD
-- The story and graphics are fine, one of the better aspects of this game. If I ever finish this game, it'll be for the story.
-- The world looks good, the dungeons have some great details (moving the herky-jerky camera view around all the time was something of a pain). I like the puzzles in the dungeons!

MIXED BAG
-- The characterizations of the AI party members range from bland (Elanee, Qara), to pretty good (Khelgar), to painfully, fingernails-on-a-chalkboard annoying (Neeshka). In fact, not knowing any better, I started multiclassing my druid as a druid/rogue just so I can rid myself of Neeshka ASAP.

BAD
-- The game has a lot of D&D aspects that will seem like an alien language to anyone not familiar with D&D. Pick up a piece of armor, and it is nearly impossible to tell whether the armor is good or bad for your character or party members. Likewise the multiclassing, stats, weapons, etc. Buried deep in the dense instruction manual was a snippet advising druid players not to multiclass. Ugh. It's too late for me to fix that now. That is an example of the types of arcane mysteries of this game. If you think half the fun of playing a game like this is figuring out just what the heck is going on and you also enjoy reading a very detailed (and quite boring) instruction manual, you will absolutely love NWN2.
-- I found the battles often very weird and nonintuitive, with AI companions constantly doing what I did not want them to do. You can tweak their AI somewhat, but not nearly enough.
-- NWN2 should have introduced more of the remaining AI companions MUCH EARLIER in the game, as you are essentially stuck with the good (Khelgar, warrior), the bland (Elanee, druid), and the highly irritating (Neeshka, rogue) for most of Chapter 1 (which is a huge [and, at times, tediously long] portion of the game).

My advice to beginners in this game:
--start with a melee class or rogue
--bear in mind that weight (in your bags and in your armor) can ""encumber you"" and slow you down. Sell stuff often.
--rest often, save your game often
--don't just blithely accept the game-recommended skill-ups. I ended up wasting a lot of points in ""crafting skills"" that I would rather have spent elsewhere.

I am looking forward to Cryptic's coming online game, Neverwinter, as I can't help feeling it will be a VAST improvement over Neverwinter Nights 2. Will I finish NWN2? Maybe, maybe not. My main reason for getting it was to see what the world is like in anticipation of Neverwinter (coming in late 2011). As a non-D&D-er, I have to say I am hoping Cryptic makes the world/game substantially more intuitive than this ""D&D nerds-only"" mess.

So, is NWN2 fun? Yeah, kinda. And I am still slogging steadily forward. However, I may not ever finish it.

Would I have bought NWN2 knowing what I know now? No, I don't think so.

My recommendation: wait for Neverwinter (Cryptic), Dungeon Siege 3, and/or Dragon Age 2 -- all coming in 2011. If, like me, you enjoy quality, party-based, story-centric games and want to play one NOW, I'd recommend Dragon Age: Origins, Guild Wars, and/or Star Trek Online, the latter 2 being MMOs in name only; really, they are more single-player games, and pretty decent ones at that.",It's Just OK,1286150400,,"{'Edition:': ' DVD-Rom', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

 Okami is about the Sun goddess Ameratsu Okami who takes the form of a wolf and her little woodsprite companion issun. 100 years ago Okami known back then as Shirainu killed a evil monster called Orochi (Mountain of Darkness) by means of a warrior named Negi. Ameratsu died in the fight and in honor of her and Negi they built a monument in honor of them. Centuries later orochis evil is brought upon the world again and Okami is resurracted to battle her foe once again.

 The story is actually more complex than how I summarized it. There are tons of side quest, missions, secrets in Okami. its replay value is extreme and broad because theres so many things to do and find. I still haven't beat it 100% because of the stray beads and i'm always preoccupied doing one of the most addicting things in video game history sinse pickpocketing in Sly cooper...Fishing. No words can describe how addicting fishing is in Okami. in most games its boring, but in Okami its executed in such a way that you can't stop. Fishing is also one of the best ways to earn money for supplies and new fighting techniques.

 Combat in okami is fun and fastpaced. Many enemies in the game require some level of strategy to defeat. You can't just hack and slash expecially later when enemies are stronger. The boss battles are huge and epic. every boss is unique and strategic. If you defeat an enemy in a cool way or buy 2 techniques that bring this on they drop a Demon fang that you exchange for goods and sometimes required items.

 The world is ginormous! After Orochi peaple make the mistake of thinking they beat the game, but really theres more story to be found. just as a warning alot of the plot and stories in Okami are based off Japenese Mythology, but thats what makes it so interesting. One in particular is a story involving a box that was given to an old man as a gift from a dragon palace, but yall can see that for yourselves.

 One of the biggest highlight of Okami though are the brush techniques. they are wonderful. there are actually more techniques and moves you can use that the game don't tell you about. Most you find doing side quest, but there are some that are found in secret places.

 The absolute greatest thing and everyone knows this is the graphics and music. Theres no game out there like this. Okami is made with beutiful japenese art. the music is also very Japenese and memorable. It is absolutely breathtaking expecially when you clean the earth. I think the PS2 version does the graphics better than the Wii. I hear peaple dote on the realistic graphics of the Xbox and PS3 but it can't compare to how breathtaking Okami is. The art style and music lead to some scary moments too. In evil or bad spots in the game the music can get extremely ominous. The creepiest and scariest area in the game for me is the ghost ship. The art and erie music had me looking behind my shoulder and enemies that I ain't gonna describe for spoiler reasons appeared out of nowhere and scared the living daylights out of me. Think the Grudge meets Silent Hill XD Don't get me started on Mr. and Mrs. Cutter (shivers)

 I know peaple complain that it too easy, but this is forgiven by how much this game offers. I admit though I did die once near the end of the game fighting these 9 dogs, but thats another story and I didn't get a game over because of my astral pouch.

 This review barely touches everything in this game. Okami is one of the greatest and revolutionary video games this century. I've hoped to find more games made with unque graphics like Okami, but I can never find anyXD The only game that comes close is Mini Ninjas for the Wii (fun game), but even it can't compare to Okami.

Tetris DS features all the classic elements you'd come to expect from the classic puzzle game with a few new extras and twists thrown in for good measure that will make Nintendo fanboy's mouths water.  There are six modes of play in this incarnation of the game: there's the Standard mode which is just as the name implies, but the top screen features looks at classic NES titles like the Super Mario Bros. series, Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Excitebike, and a few other surprises to boot.  Catch Mode features a Metroid twist on things as you catch blocks and avoid Metroids.  Mission mode features a Zelda backdrop and is pretty fun, while Touch mode makes use of the touch screen to line up big blocks.

You are at the top, and the computer is at the bottom, as both attempt to push their opponent into a fiery inferno by letting the blocks drop.  Push mode works exceptionally well thanks to the use of the DS Wi-Fi capability, which makes it even more of a blast to play.

depending on your equipment and surroundings. For example, when you need to rescue

firemen at some points who help you by either backing you up or clearing obstacles.

If I was to buy only two of the games in the Resident Evil-series, I would choose this, along with the remake of the first RE from 2002. Things that separate this from the previous Resident Evil-games:

*No fixed camera angles (""The camera"" follows you wherever you go)

*More ""realistic"" enemies (At least some of them. The ""standard"" enemies you fight in this game feels more like inbred and brainwashed humans than zombies. It actually feels a bit like playing ""Deliverance - The Game"". But every now and then there is also a cave-troll (or worse) to deal with)

*Ability to buy and sell items and weapon-upgrades from a mysterious vendor (you can sell jewelry collected throughout the game and use the money to buy weapons and other cool stuff:-))

Resident Evil 5 is also made with this ""recipe"" and is also a great game that I highly recommend, but it's not as spectacular and epic as RE4.

5,False,"02 22, 2010",A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B000F5IH2I,Trenton Bennett,"There are some games that have trouble moving forward over the years:  either the type of game falls out of favor (like Adventure games did for a while) or the technology flies forward with no real way to adapt the old to the new.  Worst of all, being a sequel that comes from a long line of sequels can bring massive amounts of excess baggage from the game's predecessors that can't (or won't) be jettisoned.

Having played many an RPG, I'm very pleased to say that Final Fantasy XII navigates smoothly around all these troubles. It does an excellent job of focusing on what matters most:  a rich Role-Playing Game experience that is also rather easy to use.  Having tried their hand at just about every variation of the genre, Square Enix gives us this culmination of lessons learned, and the end product is immersive, beautiful, and fun.

Players used to the Final Fantasy series are also accustomed to having unique and complex capabilities as far as HOW they play.  If I were to start telling you about FFXII's Licenses, Gambits, Mists, and ESPers, chances are your head would spin--it's deep stuff.  In earlier titles like Final Fantasy VIII this was problematic:  the way you handled abilities and magical creatures who help you and special boosts to your weapons and stats was complicated and hard to keep track of.  Here however we have a smooth flow that slowly introduces you to the concepts and gives you a chance to try each one as you progress in the game.  Gameplay elements are better organized and not as dependent on each other.

Perhaps one of the best features in the game is ""Gambits"":  instead of manually managing every character's every action in every turn, you can apply a certain amount of intelligence to your characters using multiple rules that you create.  This can easily be done.  For example, you can have your healer heal anyone when their health falls below 40%.  You can have a party member choose to attack the nearest enemies, or to focus on whichever enemy the leader is attacking.  You can tell a magic using character to throw certain spells based on certain events.  You can organize the Gambits to better automate actions: ""attack whatever the party leader is attacking.  Failing that, just attack the nearest enemy.""  And with one tap of a button, you can override these behaviors at any time.

Another excellent feature is Licenses.  They represent a grid of all the possible skills a character can have, and they give you a seemingly infinite depth of choices for each player:  no longer do you have to choose narrow character types, like ""Mage"", ""Fighter"", ""Healer"".  Instead you simply choose how to spend points you accumulate to pick skills, spells, and equipment for each.  Naturally, this makes character mistakes easy to remedy, and it also means replaying the game can be a very different experience every time.

There are other exciting features to the gameplay that would easily double the size of this review...so let's move on to the game elements themselves.  Probably the only real limitation to this game is that it was crafted for the PlayStation 2.  Cutscenes are stunningly gorgeous, but while the in-game graphics are among the best the PS2 had to offer, this still means things look a bit blocky, edges jagged and detail a bit muddied.  When you play, you will face loading screens that transition you from one area to another, but thankfully Square occasionally fills the gaps a bit with cinematic-style transition scenes.  Moving through the story brings characters who come and go:  some are guests you have no control over.  Others join with you and become playable characters you can control.  You even have allies who may change sides, and the next thing you know you're battling your own comerades in the fight to save the world.  My only complaint in this area is that you are only allowed to take 3 of your characters ""out of the box"" at a time.  You can change back and forth any time you like, even swapping out KO'd characters for live ones, but it would be a bit more fun for me if I could have 4 characters under my control instead of 3.

Things don't stop there:  while we have gorgeous artwork, a beautifully orchestrated score, rich gameplay, and a complex system with an easy learning curve, we get the rest of the package, too:  great writing.  Interesting characters with diverse backgrounds, storylines that peg the dramatic moments and bring you along on the highs and lows of the story, drawing you in to a deep and at times very complicated plot.  There are political alliances and shadow arrangments, with people shifting sides as the story goes along.

If you're interested in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy XII is about as good as the later titles get.  If you're already familiar with the series from earlier titles, you might be pleasantly surprised at the amount of polish that has been put on this title.  If you're completely new to the RPG genre, expect this to be fairly complicated:  read the manual closely, pay attention to tutorials, and do a little reading online to immerse yourself.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.",Pushing the PS2 Envelope,1266796800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2. For my husband, who has a job that takes him away from home a lot, he can take the DS along and it easily fits into his travel grip or pocket.  He also likes the more traditional games.

Incidentally - it's also great when you have a power outage for over 2 hours like we did recently!  I turned it on and there was enough light so I could find the candles!  Then, with nothing to do but wait it out, I played ""Word Jong"" until the power came back on!  Bet you never would have thought of THAT feature, huh?

The game takes place in 2014 where the worlds economy has collapsed and war has become a daily thing. You play as Solid Snake a genetically engineered soldier whose basically perfect at what he does. Snakes mission in this game is to eliminate his twin brother liquid snake who is in charge of his own personal military company.

Pros:
The graphics for the time of this release were arguably THE best ever seen in the gaming world. The character models are great the environments look good everything overall just looks good. The gameplay is very fun and challenging, playing stealthy is a blast and very rewarding. the bosses, while maybe not as good as some from its predecessors, are challenging and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat them. What's a nice addition to this game too is the ""octocamo"" which is a suit that has the ability to blend into its environment like an octopus making it harder for the enemy to see you.

Cons:
As I mentioned before the gameplay is fun, the problem is there's not enough of it. At times the game basically just feels like one big cut scene with the gameplay just serving as a pathway from one to the next. The cut scenes can range from 20 minutes to an hour or more. This wouldn't be a problem if they had more gameplay to back it up. The story while good can be very confusing at times and newcomers will have trouble with a lot of the references from previous titles. I highly recommend you play the other games first before playing this one. If you want this game just for an awesome stealth experience it will suffice, but you will feel underwhelmed by the small chunks of gameplay in between each cut scene. The bosses as I mentioned are fun but a lot of the fun too comes from battling the regular enemies whether you're dispatching them by lethal or non-lethal means stealthily or simply just sneaking past them. either way there's not enough of these sections and it really hurts the gameplay time.

Despite having flaws an being a little overrated MGS4 is an easy recommendation to anyone a fan of the stealth genre. Even though I said there's a small amount of gameplay compared to the cut scenes the gameplay that's here is just so good that it would too tough to pass up and also if you're a fan of games with a good story this one is an apex in those terms assuming you've played previous entries in the series.","Good gameplay, too much cut scene.",1454112000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have to say that this game is absolutely incredible and thorough and satisfying for (I assume) RPG, FPS, and TPS fans - excluding the beginning.

Pros:

1. Incredible story - very diverse, stunning, and mostly original
2. Spooky enemies, hard bosses
3. Vast variety of tons of weapons
4. Ability to customize weapons heavily to your liking
5. Mostly smart AI
6. Very cool and useful gadgets

8. Ability to work with others against the unique PMC soldiers and gain respect and assistance, compliments in battle.
9. Strong connection to the previous titles, but even if you haven't experienced them - MGS4 will be extremely
enjoyable.
10. Amazing innovative cut-scenes that contain better action than most Hollywood movies these days and blend in seamlessly with scenes levels you play.
11. This game contains some of the best graphics I've seen in games (maybe excluding Uncharted 2). Occasionally you see little animals running around and they move and look very realistically.
12. Very long game - you definitely get your monies worth.

Cons:

1. Weak intro - you start out not really knowing what to do or how to act. You get no teaching (excluding the virtual range in the Menu - but in-game work doesn't tell you about it). Basically you start off running away from these freaky man-machine creatures.
2. Some cut-scenes can be too long, especially if you're impatient. This may bother these people, but it didn't bother me - these scenes are still fun to watch - some do last over 20 minutes which is unusual.
3. Occasional aliasing (sp?) throughout the game if you have a 720p HD system, but the graphics are still stunning.
4. The highly complicated in-game menu for changing weapons and customizing the weapons can be quite confusing at first. It'll take many hrs to get used to it.
5. No trophies?

Overall - I'd say an A- game. All games do have cons - the cons in this title are not bother-sum at all and this title is extremely enjoyable and fun. Snake (Old Snake in MGS4) is sweet and cool!

5,True,"08 3, 2008",A2Q6SZYBMG5RVH,B000FQ2D5E,Maria Marienthal,"I will start with the obvious, the game looks beautiful.  The graphical
quality does not change between cutscenes and gameplay.  Kojima and his team pulled out all the stops on the beauty of this game, as they have always striven to do.

SPOILER ALERT
Then there is the story.  A lot of people harp on the Metal Gear Series because the story is full of twists.  One person even said that the plot was twists and only twists.  That person missed the point completely.  Especially by the end of this game, it becomes apparent what Kojima had been pushing for.  The message about humanity is clear... the MGS series has always been anti-war, anti-genetic determinism, anti-environmental determinism, every mistake that humanity has ever made with regards to war and control of the populous has been addressed in some way.  Consider the history through which Kojima derives his inspiration.  His home country of Japan experienced an apocalypse during WWII while causing an apocalypse in mainland Asia at the same time.

In all situations of war no matter who begins the fight or where it starts or ends, the young will repeat the mistakes of the old, and the old will let the knowledge gained from their mistakes slip away with death.  Even the most heinous actions, deception, murder, are a means to an end, and the end is all that really matters.
SPOILERS OVER

Gameplay was spectacular.  The MGS franchise is one of very few that has made significant gameplay improvements with every subsequent release.  Control of Snake feels much more fluid, yet at the same time you can feel his age in the way he performs.  Though he is more agile and powerful than the average human could ever be, he isn't quite the same old Snake.  He is THE Old Snake.

Old Snake gets a lot of neat toys in this game, too.  Most notably is his chameleon suit.  If he lays flat, his suit will automatically adopt the pattern of the materials that are on the floor.  By pressing the ""triangle"" button while up against a wall, he will adopt those coverings as well.

The second great toy is Drebin's shop.  Drebin is a weapons launderer who gives Old Snake full access to replacement ammo and other supplies.  ID Locked weapons can be converted to old-world weapons that do not require nanomachine permissions.  There are A LOT of weapons in this game.  First time through you probably won't get to experience all of them, and that is okay.  Just check them out on your next run.  The game is only about 10-15 hours long depending on how you choose to play.  Also, through Drebin's shop Old Snake can modify his weapon.  The first weapon, the M4 Custom is a good all-purpose weapon.  It packs a decent punch and holds 30 rounds.  It can be modded with a shotgun attachment, grenade launcher, or foregrip for stability.  Laser sights and scopes can also be added to the M4 and other select weapons.  So play around and have fun.

Toy #3 is the Metal Gear Mark II, Hal's minature Metal Gear Rex that is mostly harmless...mostly.  When you need a buddy to turn the corner and remain unseen for you, Mark II can cast an invisibility cloak and make sure the coast is clear.  If things get sticky, it has a shock wire function to incapacitate unsuspecting foes.  The same tool can be used to knock on surfaces to distract your enemies and guide them away from Old Snake's true position.  It is a neat little gadget that you may or may not find to be useful.

Next up, the enemies.  In this game, it is impossible to hate the enemies you fight (except for Vamp) because they are amazing, flat-out.  Whether they are GECKOS (bipedal beast machines), FROGS (all-female supersoldiers), or Private Military Company militia-men (remnants of their humanity will keep you grounded), or the Beauty and the Beast Corps (best enemies in of all time in videogames?), enemies are not just targets.  Kojima and his crew made the enemies in this game characters to be admired.  They neither have names nor faces, but they will f*** your day up very quickly if you do not respect their power.  From the top down, they are all capable killers.

The humanity of this game lies within Snake's allies.  Meryl, Eva, Hal, the Colonel, Mae Ling, Raiden, Rosemary, Naomi, and especially Sunny represent the other side of life.  Old Snake is a manufactured product of war, the only life he has ever known.  No machine can imitate or destroy the compassion that these individuals shared.  This is passion.  I won't go on, can't explain much else without major spoilers.

Gameplay, people, visuals, this game is stunning.  Metal Gear Sold 4 exemplifies why videogames deserve to be celebrated as art.  It has the story worthy of novel publishing, breath-taking visuals, engrossing music, and an all-around realism that we celebrate in paintings such as the Mona Lisa.  If only more videogame producers put this much time and effort into a game.  Production for perfection... long hours, perspiration, and inspiration to produce the culmination of one's efforts... that is art... this is art.

If you are a casual gamer, this is not for you.  If you have never played the other MGS games, this is probably not for you.  Play through MGS1-3 in order to get the story and gameplay straight, and then play MGS4.

For everyone who has been trying to compare this game to COD and HALO...come on.  MGS4 is not a pure shooter.  They put it nice and bold on the cover, ""Tactical Espionage Action"".  That means be sneaky and use force only as needed.  Play a ""shooter"" and judge other shooters with it.  MGS4 is NOT, I repeat, is NOT a shooter.

Could this go down as one of the best games of all time? Absolutely.  Game of the Year?  For sure.  It is in a league of its own.  Nothing else plays like it.  Few other games are as engrossed in the mystique of political/sci-fi conspiracy.  Too few have such dedicated stories.  In most games, the producer's passion is not as apparent.  MGS4 had a 105 degree fever with Kojima's ardor for gaming perfection.  The game feels like he and his team cared.

4,False,"06 9, 2007",A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000FQ2GUQ,Cloud,"When the first God of War came out, you almost couldn't escape the massive hype and praise it received. From its gameplay to its outrageous violence and ""emotional storyline"", many critics and fans alike absolutely fell in love with it...except me. Sure gameplay-wise it was slightly fun at times but it was unbelievably repetitive, needlessly frustrating at times and the storyline wasn't exactly emotional at all. So of course the inevitable sequel comes out during the Playstation 2's final days and like many blockbusters, it's bigger, it's badder but not necessarily better.

Story: Despite my grievances about the presentation about the original's storyline which felt more emotionally neutered despite the scenes revealing Kratos' past, this game just feels wrong. Instead of redemption and atonement for his sins, this game is basically a big hissy fit on his part when he's ""Metroid""'d of his powers and has to face Zeus. This is essentially like hunting Ares only this time it's Zeus.

Graphics: Of course the graphics impress although not much has changed since the original. The world still feels believable and interactive and the level design, while a step down, is still nicely done. Where the game shines, as usual, are its FMV's which are very cinematic and sharp in their quality.

Sound/Music: Aside from the VA actor doing Kratos who essentially just plays ""angry"" throughout the whole thing, everyone almost has a B-movie quality in their voice. As for the music, it's sound big and epic with its choir and strings but it's largely forgettable with nary a memorable hook anywhere.

Gameplay: Basically the main thing is the combos. Blessed with many weapons and skills, Kratos has to fight (and fight) legions of enemies with big, complex moves. While they look cool, you'll soon discover quickly some work better than others and you'll just end up re-using them. As well, Kratos is given some new spells such as a bow and arrow, lightning and others. Nothing new really as changed, just the names. Whether it's a case of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" or just simply a lack of wanting to change things up is anyone's guess.

As for the game itself, there are times where it's a bit frustrating but it seems almost more tolerable. There's still things like repeatedly pressing a button to open doors which was a dumb idea although trying to stab minotaurs no longer requires you to quickly press the O button and have your fingers fall off like the last one. Puzzles, unlike the more brain-teasers of Zelda and Ico, are strictly relegated to trial and error. Try that. Nope, died. Try this. Nope, died. Oh ok, so you do this?  Ah, there we go. That's it, no logic benders or things that make you think, just exhaust all possibilities of a solution till you finally find it.

Is this a game worth buying? Well if you've loved the last one, you'll love this one too although how much more is hard to say. And if you didn't like the last one, this one ain't going to change your mind one bit.",Like the last one but with a shinier coat,1181347200,2,,

The Bad: Occasional frustrating platforming segments, ho-hum co-op mode, uninteresting story, not enough ""Wiiness""

SMG disappointed me a little and YES it did. It just didn't have enough...Wiiness if that makes any sense. While there are wonderful ideas and elements in the game SMG is nothing original. The game has you flying across planetoids and what not to save Princess Peach from Bowser once again. With the addition of collecting star bits by using the cursor of the Wiimote and using them to stun enemies and feed Lumas, this is just one of many elements that makes SMG great.

You can flick the Wiimote to make Mario spin, and the controls are very well thought out. It's not really the controls or anything that makes SMG unique but its the style of the game. For example there is a galaxy where you'll have fruit planetoids and you need to smash wood plugs to make a worm come out of the apple planetoids to cross to the next. With this coupled with bright colorful (and actually somewhat next-gen) graphics it's total eye candy (for the Wii anyways). The game also sports charming and wonderful music. What also makes the game unique is how you explore the levels. The game uses gravity tricks a lot such as switching gravity on you at certain points, using gravity spotlights, being able to walk around a planetoid instead of falling off etc. You can also change into Bee Mario, which lets you fly and cling to walls, there's Fire Mario, Rainbow Mario, Ice Mario etc.

All these things are just so cleverly crafted together and it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. There's no way to express how cool this all is unless you just play the game. While this is good and all it does have its flaws. There are occasional frustrating platforming segments that have too much action going on, or things move to fast for you to figure out what to do. While the game does sport a co-op mode it's nothing really special or interesting. The story is the same as every other Mario game and has a confusing and disappointing ending etc.

The only people who don't see this are the Nintendo fan boys and die-hard Mario fans. I wouldn't consider this a winner for GotY but definitely for best Wii game of the year.

My shorthand take on it is that it's awesome and engaging, but at the end of the day, when you turn it off, you know it's a game. In my opinion, that's bad, because a very good game is supposed to keep your beliefs suspended and let you entirely into its world. A good game lets you take its reality and make it yours.

Sadly, the absence of that means that I think my first play-through of the game is going to be my last, at least for a very long time. Not because I don't WANT to ever play it again, but because I'm just not... interested enough in it. How could a game this amazingly made have such little replay value (for me, anyway)?

The problems I had fell into 3 areas.  Graphics.  Since it was designed for Gamecube, don't expect anything amazing.  I thought the colors were lacking, too many browns.  In hindsight, I now see why Nintendo made Wind Waker with cel shading, given the hardware abilities/limitations of the Gamecube.  On the plus side, the framerate was flawless.  Music.  Nothing memorable here.  Certainly nothing to hum when the game is turned off.  Wolf stages are not very fun.  Later in the game you do get the ability to switch back and forth between Link and the Wolf, which is better.

Now, this is subjective, but I found the motion controls frustrating.  Motion controls work great for Wii Sports, but having tried Wind Waker with a Gamecube controller that is the more precise control method.  YMMV.

Dungeons are great as usual.  It is fun trying to figure out how to use the various items to solve puzzles and navigate through them.  Boss fights are well done and interesting.

What is great about Nintendo first party franchises (Mario, Zelda, Metroid, etc) is that they are hardly ever bad.  They usually range from above average to game of the year.

4,True,"09 24, 2012",A3R33KMESG0XGQ,B000FQBPCQ,Romero,"I, like many, was very excited for this game. Heck, I wasn't even that much into Zelda at that time, but I remember when the whole Wii reveal was commencing, and the new Zelda game just blew people away. My roommate's eyes widened when he saw the first trailer in 2005 (he was a huge Zelda nut), and I knew I had to get into Zelda before TP (as it would come to be known). So, along with coming to know the Wii's hardware, I was excited about the game. Very much that I had to pre-order it before I even had the system; thankfully, I used a friend's.

Come the release of the game, and I was shocked. Not by the greatness of the game, but how the Wii's controls didn't work as I expected. I thought it was the control itself--maybe it was faulty--but I learned that Link didn't have 1:1 movement. Heck, the Wii didn't have 1:1 precision. Still, that didn't deter me from playing and enjoying the game.
I had played only Ocarina and the original Zeldas beforehand, so when I started the game and got a good ways into it, I I realized it was very formulaic, but still kept the edge by having Link transform into a wolf, not to mention it was the ""darkest"" Zelda out there, giving Hyrule a shadowed theme and having the characters look more real than ever (as real as they can look).

The usual minigames were present, and the arsenal didn't feel entirely revolutionary. What was great, though, was fighting on Epona and utilizing wolf Link's abilities. The fights with wolf Link left me wanting to transform back to human, but it weren't entirely irritating. Midna is a great addition to the franchise, though she did, like Link's many female companions, become slightly annoying at times. The final fight was great, implementing a wide range of the installment's weaponry and the Wii's controls (considering it was an enhanced GameCube game), ended up being my favorite Zelda game--until Skyward Sword.

Graphics
you've heard/read it a hundred times but the graphics are indeed very good.  They feel very realistic in contrast to the cartoony graphics of Gears of War.

Controls
Many people complain about the controls, but i think they're fine. As a gamer who usually plays shooters on Xbox 360 I wasn't sure how the controls would handle and at first they take a bit of getting used to, but after about ten minutes they feel natural.  Also the developers implemented six-axis functionality very well - rather then going overboard or not using it at all as some do. The six-axis has two main uses - turning a wheel or planting a c-4 charge in campaign, or the other use, which i thought was quite ingenious, is when you're sniping - the more your hand moves the controller, the harder it is to keep the scope level and vice versa - a very nice realistic touch.

Campaign
the campaign is not very long - i beat it in around 5 hours on normal - so i don't recommend this as a single player only game.  Overall the story was pretty good and i enjoyed the cut scenes, it was also easy to understand without having played the original killzone. At different points in the game the player uses different vehicles/gun emplacements such as an AA gun and a tank, which makes it more interesting then a strictly FPS game.  Also the cover system is implemented fairly well and the player doesnt slide into cover like they do in Gears of War.
On the negative side the there wasn't very much variation between maps - fighting is mostly limited to Pyrrhus - capital of Helghan - the desert and an ISA battleship. There was also too much backtracking in my opinion and they really should have included a co-op option. Overall it's an above average campaign.

Artificial Intelligence
the AI is pretty good - the enemies take cover, usually stay down when getting shot at, and don't stand still . They are also good at flanking and will sneak around you if given the chance.

Multiplayer
The online component of killzone 2 is a mix between the new Call of Duty games and Warhawk - you rank like COD and receive medals/ribbons and join games like warhawk. Matches have up to 32 players, and maps are voted on before the match. Map voting is not like the Gears 2 or CoD/Halo 3 style where you can only pick between two maps or vote to veto, instead you are given a map list and get to pick which one you want to play at. There are five games types - body count(team death match), assassination, search and destroy, capture and hold, and search and retrieve (capture the flag). You can choose to play one game type or all five. If you choose all five then the game will cycle through the game types every five minutes or until the one team wins the game type (i.e. assassinates the other teams target). Like i said the ranking is a lot like CoDs in that you earn points towards your next rank based on points earned each round for completing objectives or getting kills, and the higher you rank the more guns and classes you have access too.  Also of note is that the cover system and some of the single player guns - bolt gun, electric gun - were left out of multiplayer, i actually prefer this as im used to the lack of a cover system and use of conventional weapons after playing CoD. My least favorite part of the online aspect is that the Helghan and ISA troops both glow to make them easier to locate, which is both helpful and annoying.

A Few Tips for Online
-you don't start out with very much ammo so don't 'spray n pray' instead use quick bursts
-aim for the head - head shots are easy to get
-when playing a level for the first time camping can be an easy way to get kills while minimizing deaths
-when playing against the Helghast aim for the red area - this is where their head is, and you can get easy long range headshots this way.

3,False,"02 28, 2009",A2T1U1QJ4CLFHO,B000FQBF1M,P.C.S.,"Just as the title reads - nothing special to see here - Resistance 1 and 2 are much better bets than this game if you need a PS3 exclusive shooter.

The story is horrible, the AI is utter garbage (I lost track of how many times my teammates block my path and will not move), the voice acting and writing is also atrocious (especially the Coletrain wanna-be), and finally the game is REALLY dark (first game ever I've had to crank up the brightness on my TV just to see the hidden symbol on the brightness adjustment screen).

The controls are unresponsive - adjusting sensitivity seems to make no difference - and this is REALLY annoying. I could live with the rest of the problems - almost all FPS games have AI, graphics, story, etc, problems. But the poor controls make the game really frustrating at times.

Cliffs: If you like first person shooters you will like this - I still enjoyed playing it but it was at times very frustrating. But there is nothing really new here, nor is there anything amazing here either.

This review may be a little long.

After countless delays, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is finally here, and it goes above and beyond Super Smash Bros. Melee in almost every way possible.

The improvements over the previous Smash Brothers game are quite abundant.  There are now thirty five characters.  Fourteen of which must be unlocked first, either through several matches, classic mode or the games adventure mode.  There are also a plethora of new stages as well as a few classic ones thrown in from Super Smash Bros. Melee.  There are also new items and a whole new slew of extras to be found within this game.  Simply put, this game is huge and won't keep you busy for just weeks, but months on end.  Perhaps even years.

There are two big single player modes to trump through.  First, there is classic mode which is not much different from the classic mode presented in Melee.  You'll fight battles either one on one, two on two, three on one or a giant version of a character.  There are also team battles and ""Metal Menaces"" to fight.  You'll also see the return of Master Hand and Crazy Hand.  Classic Mode can now be done with a friend instead of just by yourself as well.

However, the real deal in single player is easily the Subspace Emissary.  Brawl's own adventure mode.  The adventure mode here actually includes a story.  The story is a little confusing at first.  Mainly because there's no voice acting or even written dialog between the characters.  You'll eventually grasp on to it, though, and even come to like it.  The story even comes off as somewhat epic.  The adventure mode here is much more fleshed out than in Melee.  You'll fight an abundance of characters and have an abundance of characters join your ranks.  You'll fight through chaotic boss fights and intricately designed levels.  And you don't even have to go through adventure mode alone.  A friend can fight alongside and many moments in the story call for more than one character to go through a certain level.  The other good thing about going through Adventure Mode is that it can be a different experience on a subsequent play.  Even better, however, is that the Adventure Mode is not that short.  It will easily take you anywhere from nine to ten hours to complete it the first time, and you'll end up having to play a second time just to snag all the trophies.

Of course, the real treasure of any Smash Bros. game is the multiplayer aspect.  Brawl doesn't disappoint.  The matches are fierce and there are a ton of new things.  As in the previous games, players go to a level where they battle against either other players or the computer.  There are several new items added this time around.  There's the sticky bomb, which sticks to a character until it detonates.  There's the assist trophy which works a lot like the Pokeball and many more.  The most important new item, though, is easily the Final Smash.  The Final Smash is a devastating attack that usually serves as a one hit kill.  You'll probably want to check out every character's Final Smash skill at least once.  These aren't just the most powerful attacks in the game, they're some of the coolest looking as well.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl also supports four different controller functions.  The Wii Remote by itself, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck, the Classic Controller and the Gamecube Controller.  All of these controls are decent, but the Gamecube controller is easily the best of the lot.  The controls are mapped out exactly like Super Smash Brothers Melee.  Anyone who played Melee to no end will easily find comfort in the controls here.  Regardless of what control function you use, the controls are tight and highly responsive.

The best part about Brawl, however, may very well be all the extras.  You've got a series of trophies to collect and characters to unlock, but there's a lot more than just these things.  You can also unlock soundtrack selections and new stages as well.  In addition to all these things you can also save some matches and watch them again.  Brawl also gives you the option of creating your own levels and saving screenshots.  This is in addition to some of the things that returned from Melee such as Event Battles and the Homerun Contest.  There's so much to be explored within this game.  Brawl also goes online, and being able to fight people anywhere is amazing.

Super Smash Bros. Brawl also looks and sounds incredible.  The graphics being the best the Wii has yet.  The stages themselves look absolutely incredible.  The backgrounds are highly detailed.  The music here is some of the best to grace the gaming world.  Nintendo got some of the most famous composers in the industry to contribute music and the soundtrack doesn't disappoint.

Is Brawl perfect?  No.  While it's nice to go online you'll still have to deal with friend codes and there's no way to voice chat or communicate with the people you're playing against online.  When playing with friends, it'd be nice to be able to say something.  The game also suffers from some fairly long load times.  And while Adventure Mode is a treat, the last few hours of the run can become extremely repetitive.

Despite all this, Super Smash Brawl is a must buy for Super Smash Brothers fans.  If you enjoyed Super Smash Brothers Melee and the original title that started it all, Super Smash Brothers Brawl is a real treat to own.",Smashing,1205020800,16,,

I am about 8 hours into playtime and it is definitely the best racer I ever experienced. I have never played any GT games, but I played most other famous racers like the Burnouts, PGR2 and 3 and NFS. I would like to address some perceptions to help the potential buyer make an informed decision.

Sensation of Speed - Give the game time to build up your collection of cars. Once you are awarded the high-end cars, the sensation of speed is undeniable, especially at 60 frames per second. One can't really compare this game to the Burnout titles which give a totally different and arcade-like feel.

Graphics - There are complaints out there that the game has ""jaggies"". I just don't see them. The graphics and especially the modeling of the cars are the best I have seen in a racer with not a single frame-drop ever. I do have an HD set and perhaps the game doesn't look good on a 480i set. I couldn't tell you.

Sound -Although the music is B- rated at best, the sound where it counts, in the cars and ambient sound, is excellent.

Tracks - This is where I agree with most in that the variety of tracks is definitely lacking. Also, the tracks are quite plain. That may be the sacrifice the design yields from sticking to 60 FPS.

Wheel misperception -Unless you have been racing with a wheel or don't have much experience with racing games using a dual stick controller, I DON'T recommend getting one. I have been playing racing games with a dual stick controller for a long time. I thought too that getting a wheel would improve my experience. I bought a good quality wheel and had to return it because the paradigm shift was too great. Keep in mind all the nuances that your fingers are used to in adjusting the dual stick controllers and triggers for gas and brake. These movements now have to be translated to a wheel and your feet. I winded up returning the wheel because I couldn't keep any car under control and I realized it wasn't the wheel's fault, it was my inability to translate from the sticks to the wheel. Again, that is just me.

Difficulty - Again some people think it is too hard or too easy. I just don't see it. This title has an unprecedented amount of difficulty settings from any video game, not just racers. One has to spend the time to see the many different options available to adjust difficulty from almost arcade-like to extremely difficult with many increments in between those settings.

This is a superb quality title and I highly recommend experiencing it.",The Most Misunderstood Game of 2007,1181433600,7,,

I usually pick up all the major releases for 360; I figure that if I really don't like a game, I can trade the premium titles in for a good exchange anyway; I usually try to play through the game at least once to see how the story goes; if the multiplayer is good I might keep it for a longer time. My favorite games of course I hang on to.  I got this a few days after it came out. The graphics are OK-like most 360 games the cut scenes are better rendered than the game play but the graphics are still quite good. The weapons, from what I remember, are similar to the first 2 games, the controls are the same which is good.

I'm playing on normal level and still die quite a bit (again Im not good at shooters). Once there are Brutes around I'm dead. The things that giggle at you are annoying but pretty easy to kill.

It was just enough fun that I was willing to put up with the view swinging around wildly whenever I moved the mouse, and I was even willing to put up with dying dozens of times while trying to figure out how to get through particular sequences, but the last straw was when I got to the spot where I'm chasing some creature and I end up in kind of a pit where the only way out seems to be climbing a tree, and for the life of me I could not do it no matter how hard I tried. Jumping up on branches of the tree while trying to move the mouse as little as possible because it tends to fling you around, all while listening to intense music and a voice in your head pushing you to move as fast as possible, is a great formula for severe frustration.

It's a casual train simulator with a fun and vibrant feel and it's a real joy and one of my favorite games.

There's a lot of fun in this game, but it's flawed by some design and technical problems, even after the patches.

What's great:

- Fun theme, graphics, sound, and music
- Very intuitive track laying that lets you focus on connecting things instead of worrying about tunnels, grades, bridges, and raising and lowering terrain
- Lots of industries to chain together
- Being able to buy or build industries, take over your competitors, etc
- Scenario goals
- Different sets of goods for different maps (France, North America, Gold Rush, Germany, etc)
- They issued a free expansion pack with Christmas graphics, goods, and a scenario. Very high quality.

What's not:

- Random crashes when previewing laying track and scrolling the screen
- Maps are pretty small and can be fairly crowded (crowded can be nice, but I often felt later in the game that I'd like a larger world)
- Connecting different track lines is cumbersome. It can be so hard to manage that I don't bother unless I need more than 4 trains running to a station
- The simplification of things comes at a price of detailed control over your track and stations
- The game requires the CD to be in the drive tray in order for the game to start. This is annoying since I consider this a more casual game that I can pick up, play for a bit, and this is a game that I continue to play over the years.

To be challenging is important, to be fun is vital, but to make a product that works is essential. Many grand strategy games today are so fatally bugged, not to mention poorly designed and implemented, that great ideas are squandered. Avid players of Paradox games know this all too well.

Generally, the AI is aggressive, and tries to put up a good fight, but there is one major problem: the AI ignores islands and doesn't seem to transport troops by boat - a severe strategic limitation that the human player may exploit.

Out of the five games I've bought since I got this hand held, I've only kept two of them. The main problem I've noticed is that the games where either too repetative or the difficulty was skewed towards being too difficult or too easy. Cooking Mama embodies both of this common problems, as once the novelty of the touch screen control weares off, there is very little substance remaining.

Cooking Mama is about cooking, of course. As you complete recipes, new ones become available for a total of 76 unique dishes. After unlocking of those, you can combine two recipes for even more complex and difficult culinary challenges, and practice certain cooking skills. It may seem on paper that there is a lot to do here, but in reality there really isn't. Each recipe is broken down into a series of steps, each step representing a beat the clock mini-game. Here in lies Cooking Mama's main problem. The mini-games are really repetative. You'll see seeing a lot of the same one's over and over again, sometimes twice in the same recipe. Cut the vegetables, boil the ingredients, slice meat, dry fry the food. The recipe unique games are few and far between. And goodness help you if really hate one of the games that pop up frequently. I can't stand the game where a series of intrustions scrolls across the top screen and you must perform the action just as it passes over this little line. It's not hard or anything, just annoying and sometimes you can do it up to three times per recipe.

The DS cartridge is capable of holding ports of 3D Nintendo 64 games so there really is no excuse why Cooking Mama only seems to have about 30 mini-games total. Some of the challenges are utterly ridiculous too. One game has you imputting the number of minutes Mama tells you to onto a microwave. It's no challenge at all, and its the kind of activity that belongs on a Speak-N-Spell. In fact most of the mini-games really aren't very challenging. The only one that I ever found difficult was the game where you have to coat meat in bread crumbs because it takes forever to do it.

I found all of the main levels very enjoyable, and the 2 major boss levels fun too. The mini-games are cute, but if you've got the Mario 64 port or Super DS Mario it's basically variations of the whack a mole game.

 Given that, 72 levels seems a lot. It isn't. Most of them I got at least one Mario through first time and they take about a minute each. So call it three hours of gameplay, being generous. There is some lasting appeal in that you can go back and get a higher score on levels (this is needed to unlock the major boss levels). But even that much isn't hard to do.

 Also, the total use of the stylus can get annoying ... a lot of the game controls would have been much nicer (and not changed the game mechanics) with button usage.

 You can't play multiplayer with one game and multiple DS. In fact I don't think there is a vs. mode at all, although you can swap levels with friends (assuming you both have games and one of you makes a level worth swapping :).

And the roster is also sort of boring. Silver, Sonic, and Shadow are fast (obviously) and Knuckles is the slowest, that's all there is to know. The only character I like is Metal Sonic. The storyline is also very boring, just people chasing Eggman Nega and Eggman. That's not a big deal, though, because I don't buy video games to read them. I would recommend this game to (maybe) have on the go, but not to play at home or something. Just something to do when you're bored.",Ehhh...,1246147200,6,{'Platform:': ' Sony PSP'},
1,False,"03 14, 2013",A259W5KIP41XFL,B000G0HJ3K,Jennifer A. Everhart,"You know, I have been a huge Sonic fan for as long as I can remember, right down to the Genesis days.  I know that the 3D Sonic games tend to have a polarizing reputation, but in all honesty, I liked most of his 3D outings, with the only two exceptions being the SD version of Unleashed, which wasn't bad by any means, but I preferred the HD version (which I am going to discuss later on), and THIS!  Okay, so the gist is that Sega had to rush the game into stores in order to meet the 15th anniversary deadline so they could remain financially stable, and it really shows.  One the one hand, I do admire how it tries to recapture the ambition of the Adventure duology & Shadow the Hedgehog, but when it misses, it really misses.  First, let's look at the story.  Sonic decided to go on a vacation in Soleanna, the City of Water, where they are celebrating the Festival of the Sun.  Just as when its princess, Elise, lit the giant torch in the center of the city, Dr. Eggman with a new and pretty odd appearance, arrives and captures Elise to seek the Flames of Disaster, despite Sonic's best efforts to save her, but she gives him the blue Chaos Emerald.  So, Sonic teams up with Tails and Knuckles to rescue Elise, investigate the mystery of the Flames of Disaster Eggman mentioned, rinse and repeat about six times, and there you have Sonic's story.  Shadow's story is that he and Omega broke into Eggman's base to rescue Rouge and retrieve the Scepter of Darkness.  However, at the rondevux point, Eggman knocks the scepter out of Rouge's hands and causes it to shatter, freeing an entity known as Mephiles who took on Shadow's appearance as he was the one who sealed him inside ten years before using time travel.  There is also the newcomer, Silver, who came from a future devastated by Iblis and enlisted the help of Blaze from Sonic Rush, who possibly warped there and lost her memory for some reason.  Since Iblis keeps healing despite their best efforts to take it down, they run into Mephiles who uses Chaos Control for them to travel back in time in order to kill Sonic, who Mephiles prophecised to be the so-called ""Iblis Trigger"", and it becomes one big, convoluted, contradictory, stupid, melodramatic, & plot hole-laced adventure with a revolting love story between Sonic & Elise for good measure.  Wrap your head around that.  In addition to the 4kids voice cast, there was also Lost in Space survivor Lacey Chabert as the voice of Elise, who also made a guest appearance in the Black Christmas remake the exact same year.  To be fair, Chabert's voice in general can be annoying at times, but she at least tries acting-wise.  She, along with Mike Pollock as Eggman & Dan Green as Mephiles, were the three best voice actors in this game.  Everyone else's talents were wasted by the material they had to work with.  As far as the gameplay is concerned, I do admire how it tries to recapture what made Adventure 1 & 2's gameplay so special to me and try not to make the same mistake Heroes made in having the playable characters, stages, and bosses virtually the same; and the music is pretty cool.  However, it was bogged down by some fatal flaws.

1. It suffers from the exact same problem as Spyro: Enter the Dragonfly which I reviewed two years ago.  A lot of the glitches can be game-breaking and they have become the butt of a joke on Youtube, right down to Knuckles & Rouge getting stuck to the wall on occasion, characters running off loop-de-loops and falling to their deaths, etc.

2. What is up with the excessive load screens?  One way I can sum them up is talk to somebody, load screen, they tell you the objective, load screen, you do the mission, load screen, they congratulate you on a job well done, results, ANOTHER LOAD SCREEN!  Trust me.  Extensive loading can leave some people bored out of their minds, especially when you take into account of how tedious the side missions can be for some reason.

3.  Some of the character bosses can be pretty cheap, such as Silver when he constantly throws you at nearby walls using telekinesis without giving you any time to react while shouting ""It's no use"" over and over again.  The same can go for the opposite side of the spectrum when you play as Silver and you can just throw items and debris at Sonic & Shadow, and you win, kind of like in the horrible Karate Kid 3 when Daniel threw one punch at Mike Barnes and he won the fight.  At least the character battles in Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 were fair.  To be fair, the remaining bosses at least had more emphasis on strategy than the ""attack repeatedly"" no-brainer ones from Heroes, but still could have used some extra work.

4. Despite being able to roam around freely and it is not on-rails, the controls were mind-blowingly awful.  It doesn't look bad when you watch gameplay videos, but trust me, it's bad.  A lot of the characters' maneuvering felt way more slippery, clunky, and sensitive than other 3D Sonic games combined and the attacks felt so awkward and stiff that I usually get hit first.  It is hard to do controls justice and that, along with the ""where the *@&+ do I go"" level design, cheap obstacles, etc., is what killed the game for me, so the true way to know is to play it yourself, and to quote Chris McCleen from Total Drama Island, I triple dog dare you.

There are more reasons why this game became the Sonic series' crowning achievement of failure, but this review was getting long as is.  If you want to know every single solitary little thing that was wrong with it, I would suggest watching ClementJ642's 7-part rant.  I would put part one's web link below, but Amazon always deletes the link to prevent people from navigating away from the site, so I would do a search on Youtube for ""ClementJ642 Sonic 2006 Review"" to check it out when you have the time on your hands.  With that said, I will see you guys later, and the later 3D Sonic games are miles better than Sonic 2006 in execution.","To quote the Angry Video Game Nerd, this is, beyond any doubt, the worst 3D Sonic game I have ever played.",1363219200,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},
4,False,"07 21, 2006",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B000G0O6CW,Tsanche,"A lot of people haven't played the original Valkyrie Profile.  Check around here and you'll easily see it going for more than $100.  It's ridiculous to pay that much.  Greedy gamers and collectors are like that, and they know some consumers will pay.  However, if you're not up for collecting the original copy, you could easily shell out the money for this version.  It's basically a port of the original Playstation version with a few tweaks here and there.  It beats paying some greedy collector over one-hundred dollars, doesn't it?  Valkyrie Profile is a unique RPG experience that if you missed six years ago, now you'll have your chance to play it.

Players of the original often express their love affair with this game and it isn't entirely hard to see why.  Our main hero, Lenneth, is a Valkyrie.  Lenneth serves Odin, the leader of the Gods.  In the world of Asgard, a sacred war has broken out among the Gods.  Odin needs brave souls from humans to form an army to fight.  It's Lenneth's job to go to the mortal world of Midgard and find the brave souls of humans to send to Odin.

The game spans eight chapters to get you through the game.  There is a time limit, however.  Everything you do from resting to trumping through dungeons takes time.  If you're feeling very brave and gutless, you could rest for all eight chapters and then take on the final boss.  Your average gamer, however, doesn't want to do that, and so you just might opt to go and find those souls.  You can recruit up to fifteen souls (despite that you probably won't need all fifteen), and only three can enter battle at a time with Lenneth.

As you crawl through dungeons, you'll get the feel of playing some kind of action/adventure game.  For one, you'll go through dungeons running around, jumping on platforms and shooting ice-crystals, which can also be used to make platforms.  Sometimes it just feels weird but you'll quickly adapt to it.  Sometimes crawling through dungeons feels like a pain because some of the controls are so awkward.  Each dungeon is also crawling with monsters.  Battles are contact-based so if you touch a monster you'll be hurled into battle where you'll control each character with the use of the buttons on your PSP.  Each button controls one character.  The battle system feels refreshing and original at times.  It also calls for a bit more strategy.  By timing button presses you can string together combos, and you can also use magic by pressing the select button in battle.  You won't use magic often (and pressing the select button to use magic just feels weird), and stringing together combos is usually enough to thwart any opponent.

Experience points are divided among your characters how you see fit.  You will, of course find it better to spend them on your current party.  Although, you might want to consider spending some experience points on your outside souls because Odin will be wanting strong souls.  Not weak ones.  Depending on how you do this may also affect the ending of the game.  To get the better ending you will have to send Odin strong souls.  There are a multitude of endings for you to get as well.  Seeing as how on average it'll only take you twenty hours to complete the game, going for the different endings is pretty worthwhile.

The best thing about Valkyrie Profile is the music.  Some of the best I've heard in an RPG before.  The soundtrack, beautifully conducted, is what makes this game really worthwhile in the end.  It always has the right music at the right time.

Valkyrie Profile also has multiple endings and diffculty levels.  Your actions make a difference in the ending you get.  Even better, some endings and souls can't be obtained unless you're willing to play on different difficulty levels.  This brings Valkyrie Profile's replay value way up.

There are a couple of things that keep Valkyrie Profile from being as fantastic as other RPGs.  For one, the story, while fantastic, is very slow.  A lot of cutscenes are long and spend a lot of time talking and rehashing conversations that have already taken place.  Some cutscenes have voice acting.  Some voices are really good, sounding just the way you want them to sound.  Others sound a little too over-dramatic and over the top at times.  Still, for what it's worth the voice acting is perfect.

However, my biggest gripe with the game is how the recruiting system works.  I didn't play the originl Playstation version, you see, and the game does a horrible job at explaining how to recruit souls.  They do a horrible job at explaining how to organize and manage your party.  In other words, the learning curve to this game is pretty steep.  You may need some outside help to get you going.  By the time you yourself learn the bells and whistles of recruiting, you'll come to see that your team isn't nearly as good as they could be.  Luckily though, once you get it down you can really make a power house team.  I just wish that they had explained it better.

The game also takes a very long time to load.  Several PSP games suffer from this, but Valkyrie Profile suffers a great deal from it.  It takes a few seconds to open the menu and to get things going within the menu.  For example, the game has to load every time you equip a character, use an item, etc.  The load times are horribly long, but they stack up really quickly, especially with how much you're in the menu.  To accompany the often annoying load times, you'll also be faced with slowdown at some parts.  So while it's a port it isn't a fantastic port.  Some of the mechanics didn't make it over to the PSP all that well.  Still, it beats shelling out more than one-hundred dollars from a greedy collector.

Valkyrie Profile: Lenneth is a fantastic experience for those who want to re-experience it and for those new to the game itself.  It's not as good as the Playstation original, and it may be another port for the PSP, but it's still an overall rewarding experience.

This game wouldn't have half the bad rap it does if it weren't so hyped prior to launch, because nothing could live up to that.  It's a decent but glitchy shooter that Ubisoft tried way to hard to stylize, and they should have spent more time ironing the bugs out and focusing on multiplayer.

The sword play goes from a nice distraction to annoying really quickly (honestly, you just want to pull your gun out and shoot those guys).  It's all ""gesture"" based, so the sword doesn't move the way you move the remote.  You ""swipe"" the remote in a certain way, and it's like you'd pushed a button on a normal controller.  So dispel any notions you might have of freeing yourself from the pre-programed attack motions of every other game.

The gun aiming controls would be perfect except they inexplicably spaz out from time to time.  When it happens, you can hit the menu button, and move the Wii system cursor around just fine.  But come back into the game and it starts jumping around again.  So it's not my remote, my sensor bar or my Wii that's the problem -- it's the game.  It's not consistent, but it happens enough to be annoying.

I can ignore the awful voice acting, and poorly drawn cut scene images.  But since there's so much room for improvement in the game, I have to complain about them.  I'd rather have no voice acting, no cut scenes and heck, no plot if it was a solid shooter.  Sadly it's not the case.

Ubisoft tried too hard to be different here, and it's just too apparent their talents would have been much better utilized in other areas.  The whole ""focus"" system (sort of a stop time effect) is awkward to pull off and makes taking out a group of enemies too easy.  There's a whole earning respect points business that feels forced, and I'm constantly wondering why it's in the game. Also, it feels cheesy that you can just hide behind a box and magically make all your bullet wounds heal. It's not that a traditional ""health box"" would make much more sense, it's just too easy to hide and heal.  When you do die, if it's at the beginning of the level, you have to sit through whatever speech there was prior to play every time -- Really annoying when you sit through it five times and keep getting sniped by some guy you can't find.

Some of the weapons are cool, but you can only hold two of them, so it's a constant juggle as you try to guess what gun you're going to be able to find ammo for later. The sniper rifle is just awful however, and deserves to be mentioned.  Instead of zooming the entire screen into a snipe view like every other shooter, the whole screen fades so it is too dark to see, except for a tiny cross hair that you have to move around.  It forces you to scroll all over trying to see anything.  Also, instead of detecting where you hit an enemy (giving headshots more damage for example) they opted to cop out and just make the sniper rifle kill in one hit regardless of where you hit people.  It's sad when Goldeneye -- an early N64 game -- has more features and thought behind it than this.  They could have just ripped off it's features and had a better product.

The multiplayer mode has no computer controlled opponents, so unless you happened to get 3 extra remotes and 3 extra nunchucks, you aren't ever going to play it.  I haven't yet, and probably won't be able to any time soon.

Aside from all that, it's still a fun FPS when you ignore its faults. Busting into a room and taking everyone out can be exciting, especially when you start accidentally blowing up cars or whatever they are hiding behind.  If you're really starved for a Wii FPS (and have $50 to burn) give it a shot, but honestly you're probably better off renting it.",Nothing special here except the controls,1165363200,11,,

3,False,"05 1, 2008",A2C7XY7RZ8ESFB,B000G7X5P4,Morgan Cahall,"I'll make this a short one since I didn't finish the game. The game itself looks great and has good detail. The story was interesting enough to keep me going till I found out that this game shares the same problem with the other tri-ace game I played. The battles are a real time affair with you being able to dash (this is a slightly annoying feature in that one can sometimes get stuck on the scenery and then get whacked with that attack one really thought was going to miss) at the enemy and then hit one of the controller buttons to attack it hopefully knocking off a bit of the monster that you can then take to a shop to get special items. There is also a lot of stuff to find in the dungeons and a lot of items that you can ""craft"" that are better than the normal fare you get from the shops. Since this process takes a lot of time it is useful for leveling up and gaining skills for your characters. Which brings me to my problem with this game and the Star Ocean game. I like to spend time leveling up my characters and getting their skills and such. In this game you get regular old humans who stick around and eienjhar (ghosts of the fallen, picked by the valkyrie to participate in ragnarork or whatever battles the gods choose) which you level until a certain point and let them go back to being human. After these characters become human they usually give you stuff that makes the game easier (i.e. a ton of experience and a really cool sword were two i got), which is cool go track down character get cool stuff. The only problem is (to me anyway) is that apparently even though you level these guys up, you need to keep some of them. Along the way you manage to lose a good two or three humans out of what I thought was a permanet reserve. If you let all of your eienjhar go then at certain parts of the game your out of luck until you find more of them with their only being 20 or so objects in the game apparently, this can be a bit of a problem if you don't know this. Star Ocean:TTEOT did this to an extent with your choices during the course of the game determining which characters you could finish the game with. Make the wrong choices and you may be at lv. 60 while the rest of your party is at level 20 while that next dungeon you have to clear has level 80 monsters in it. Not fun. If it was explained in the game it wouldn't be that bad or if the characters weren't around afterward saying have a nice trip (leaving you to trudge for the 90th time back to town restock on revives because that darn lvl 80 monster sneezed on most of your party again, it even said excuse me.)and then going back to pruning roses or whatever. To anyone who wants to play this game, it is fun and if you know going in that you have to have some team management you'll proably make it through the game just fine. Monster bashing is great stress relief, and its fun going back to shops to see if you finally got that elusive monster bit to get that really cool armor. Just get a game walkthrough somewhere before you spend 35 some hours backing yourself into a corner like I did.

It is clear that the focus of this game was to try something new with the series, Square tends to experiment every now and then before they drop a truly amazing Final Fantasy title (VIII and IX before X, and XII before the forthcoming XIII). This was the first FF with a custom job system. The job system is ok, but most of the job classes are pretty pointless until the end of the game (Scholar??? come on!). The story is pretty standard, and really seems a bit too close to the original FF, but it's not bad. Graphically, this is one of the most stunning games on the DS. The character models are all the same, but with different faces and outfits, a definite gripe of mine especially since they all look like weeble-wobbles. The music is right on par with the rest of the series, and the story has quite a twist at the end and really becomes interesting. The battle system is just fine, this was the last FF without the Active Battle System, so you can really think about your strategy for each round without getting bombarded with attacks. That being said, this game is menacingly difficult. It's not really the number of random encounters or the difficulty of them, it's the lack of save points within dungeons. If you get all the way through a dungeon and lose to the boss...you will have to start all over again.

The riddles are generally more logic (ATTWN had some flows in game plot as well as very short acts). Well , hmpf, there is an annoying thing as I 've found: You are supposed to eavesdrop conversations with a glass , but u do that while the conductor is watching you :)

The game offers an alternative solution so players that have read the book don't expect the famous poirot solution exposed in the book to come in.

Minor flaws: The game wants the CD even after the full installation. And I don't like the way that the inventory allows you to combine items: Most games will simply permit you to grab something and to put it on something else, allowing you to combine it. In MOTOE, you need to place all items to be combined on a specific slot (which is in a different screen than the inventory) and press the 'combine' button. And, if someone needs something and you already have it in your inventory, he will get it automatically. Yes, it saves you time, but it is a bit far of reality. Also, you have to search all the shoes in order to find out a footprint match, in order to complete the ""poirot advice"" . Even If you find the footprint match at once, you still have to search all other shoes only to get a comment like 'this shoe is much too small for that footprint' . Oh, and I don't like the fact that many shoes are indentical ;)

And something weird: You can search other's luggage even if they are in the same room. Weird eh?

The sound? Good. Better than in ATTWN. What I don't like in the sound is that it is much in the background and doesn't scare you to make you get off your chair. Note: That doesn't mean that the sound is bad; It is just my personal opinion.

Other good things: Saves include a snapshot, game installs completely, you can configure screen effects, subtitles included. TAC keeps the good work up.

Oh and also: Remember you are not playing as Poirot. Tricky? Even off-line, David Suchet narration rocks.

Thumbs down: A bit short. I finished it within 2 days. Yeah, perhaps I 've been playing too long ;)

Thumbs up: Book is included.

The point guard and fatigue issue also sucks. The comp team never subs regardless of sliders. And their point guard scores 90% of the points. I played vs. Milwaukee and Maurice Williams scored practically every basket. This occured regardless of what level. Edit player is also a joke; I cannot edit the height, but at least I can edit the number and position. The rosters were supposed to be as of Aug. 24th, but where is Turiaf? And why is Battie a FA, he was never renounced or waived!

The press box angle is actually not bad. I dunno why Live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways, things like hook-shot style passes, behind the backs, even though the situation does not need those. The subsitution is also clunky; you can do the sub using the D-pad during a break in the action, but by the time you select the player you are bringing in, the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the court.

The timeouts are also timed, as in if you call a 20, there is a 20 second clock and so on. But you can always press a button to continue. The archs on the shots are off as well. Who shoots a high-archer in the paint? There are no retroes unless their unlockable. The courts look good but they don't have mascots, so it seems kinda dead. That should be the new name of this series. NBA DEAD 07.

Stellar Dance Mode is for most a complete waste of time as it requires us to play songs we do not want to and in modes we do not want to just to unlock songs in the game.  Some of the licensed songs are remixed versions that are below par to the original versions while other licensed songs are thrown on here just because they are already in other bemani games (Karaoke Revolution, Beatmania USA).  There are many Japanese songs on this mix as well as instrumentals that seem out of place in DDR.

At start you create your own hero by choosing between several races, facial look, class etc before joining the unbelievly huge and stunningly beautiful landscape of Cyrodiil. The landscape feels almost like a paradise with strong, light and very clear colors. It's like a spiritual enchanted world very hard to resist.

Everything else is also incredibly well made and thoughtfully created, from the outfits, weapons, cities, temples and animals surrounding the land.

You can live a cruel life (not without consequences) or a peaceful as a priest and magician, that's up to you, just like in the real world.

But is Oblivion flawless? No, but these ""problems"" are so minor compared to the over all experience, like repetitive fights and some lip-sync problems, so they just vanish! Oblivion is a dream, a dream that I had about the perfect game when I was a kid, and now it's real!

The game is HUGE, easily 200-300 hours and considering that value compared to ordinary 5-8 hour games (most games out there) $29.99 is insanely cheap!! The game could very well been sold for $300 due to it's amazing length and size!

The game starts out slow but once you start unlocking better cars and parts, this game really takes off.  The tracks get better and better and more fun to race on.

As you progress, you eventually unlock tier 2 and tier 3 cars and the cars really depend on what path you chose whether it be muscle, tuner, or exotic.  I chose exotic and I must say that I am having a blast.

This game is basically a sequel to Most Wanted.  Actually it feels almost exactly like Most Wanted except with better music.

The canyon duels are so cool!  What you do is you start out in one region of the map and start beating races.  Once you beat two out of the three races in each area of the map, you acquire that area, usually unlocking a car at the same time.  And once you acquire all the areas in a region, you get challenged by the boss of that region.  When you choose to accept the boss challenge, it is a canyon duel each time, but in a different canyon location for each boss you encounter.

A canyon duel consists of two stages.  Stage 1 you stay as close as you can to the boss while acquiring points depending on how close you are to him...acquiring more points faster the closer you are.  Be careful to not lag too far behind!  You are actually building your buffer zone for the next stage of the race..stage 2.  Stage 2 puts you in the lead.  Your goal is to try to stay as far ahead of the boss as possible b/c the closer he is to you, the more points he drains from your score you acquired on stage 1.  If all your points are drained before you reach the bottom, he wins and you lose.  It is basically a game of cat and mouse where you take turns being the cat.  If the one in the lead position gets too far ahead of the follower, a clock timer will start on the screen.  If that person stays way ahead for 10 seconds, they win.  On the flip side, if you are in stage 2 and get passed by the boss and he stays ahead of you for 10 seconds, he wins.  You can, however, win on stage 1.  All you gotta do is pass the boss and stay ahead of him for 10 secs.  If you do that, you automatically win and do not have to race in the second leg.

Tier 3 is when this game really shines, unlocking the Lambourginis and the Porsches as well as other extremely fast cars.  But at the same time as you progress, so do your rivals.  You will be racing other corvettes, lambourginis, and porches.

On a number of the races, shortcuts are the key.  They gain you valuable seconds.  And believe me, in some races all you have is seconds to win!

I found that blockers working for me help very much.  As you unlock parts, be sure to also tune your crew member cars which do not cost you anything to upgrade once the parts are unlocked.  A lot of times, your active crew member racing with you will actually take the win for your team...meaning YOU win. =)

As far as your crew goes, you basically have blockers (self explanatory), scouts (they find all the shortcuts which are highlighted on your map when racing with them), and drafters (which basically give you a slingshot forward kind of like in Nascar).

One of the best parts of this game is the split screen canyon duels between you and a friend.  Extremely fun!

At this point, I do not know how hard the final boss, Darius, actually is since I have not raced him yet.  I tried the final set of 4 races once and lost in the second race b/c they took a shortcut I missed and got ahead of me.  This final set of races consists of race 1 in the canyon against three of Darius's crew members, race 2 in the city against those same three, and then final two races which, I think since I have not got there yet, is a 2-stage canyon duel against Darius.

I bought the Wii version of the MSA as it was cheaper than the PS2 version. I figured since there was a GC controller option, I could hook up my PS2 controller via my controller adapter. I was disappointed to find out the D-Pad does not work. And it wasn't because the adapter isn't compatible since I also tried hooking up a GC controller and using the D-Pad on that, and it turns out that the D-Pad is just not activated in GC controller mode. So the only way to play with a D-Pad is with the Wiimote, which would've been fine, except you have to shake it to throw a grenade. They didn't even give the option for the classic controller. I like using motion controls on Wii games meant for motion control. I like thumbsticks for 3D games.

The game play is very good, you unlock more and more tracks and characters as the game progresses. Once you have mastered all the tracks you then unlock 'mirror mode' which is funny as you have to retrain your brain to the opposite corners and turns. The characters have different driving styles. Some like Gingy are super fast but hard to control whereas others like Princess Fiona are easier to control but slower to accelerate. There are hidden short cuts which can help you to win the race and hidden levers which open up other short cuts. There are various weapons you can collect along the way to launch at your opponents. These weapons like flying frogs, birds, whirlwinds and rockets are a major part of the game so there is an added skill of collecting and launching these while still trying to win the race.
There is also a 2 player battle mode which is a 2 player head to head of all these weapons in a choice of four locations.
There are tournaments and cup challenges which if you get in the top three unlock different parts of the game. To progress you must master the tracks which may limit the initial gameplay. It is rewarding as the tracks get better and better.
The characters are great with 'Shrek' voices ie Fiona is voiced by Cameron Diaz, Donkey is Eddie Murphy etc and they all hit with their unique hilarious weapons eg Pinocchio uses his nose and the game has great music and humour with the phrases the characters use. My personal favourite is Gingy saying 'I'd like to thank my parents for baking me' when he wins.
My children haven't tired of this game and my 3 year old has mastered the battles and can complete the earlier tracks (although coming last). My 6 year old can place highly in the tracks and beat me in battles fairly and squarely.
Highly recommended although parents may have to open some of the levels to give children more characters and more tracks to play with.

This game is right on top of the Starforce lists, found on any of the Boycott Starforce Websites.

Starforce is a copy protection program that installs hidden drivers on your computer, that aren't removed when the game is removed.

The problem is, over time, these drivers activate themselves, whenever and without warning, to check whether or not you are making copies ... of anything. These drivers are incompatible and uspurp and replace the actions of the correct drivers that came with your computer.

Optical multidrives are pretty darn expensive to replace. Mine is in the neighborhood of 500-600 dollars.  I don't want to lose it to a 7.50 game.

I already lost my  80 GB @ 5400 RPM hard dive after unwittingly downloading 3 Starforce games on my then newish Toshiba 17"" desktop replacement notebook with a P4 @ 3.2 Ghz processor, 1.5 GB RAM, a Toshiba super multi drive optical drive and a NVidia Geforce Fx Go 5200 graphics card.  My system has now been surpassed in technology...but it wasn't cheap when I bought it. I don't want to throw it away.

The games I downloaded were all very cheap and reasonable...I thought.

Beware and please check the lists for every game you buy.  Amazon has been wonderful about leaving Starforce posts and reviews up.

Amazon, you are wonderful.  This is a good place to buy.  Many online retailers would rather have you lose your computer to a 7.50 game than leave the warning posts up.

Starforce and the damage it causes is very real. It doesn't happen all at once, but it happens.  Have you gotten messages from Windows stating that your drivers have been misplaced and they are going to put them back where they belong?  That's just one of the peculiar happenings  that I experienced after Starforce.  I was losing so many drivers, I paid for a driver down subscription at a scanning site.  Good Golly Miss Molly ... it was a rough year.  It ended with my Genuine Copy of XP all of sudden not reporting as Genuine.

Can you imagine how hard it was to get a live warm body to verify product codes at Microsoft...pretty darn hard.

You can have all that and more, plus no computer if you download and install Starforced games or software.

Your choice...I wasn't aware of one at the time.

How I found out about Starforce?  I remembered the three games from when I started to have computer problems.  After my hard drive failed, I couldn't forget those games and looked up the titles to see if anyone else had noticed performance changes after installing them.  They did.

4,False,"08 27, 2012",AM2CKH3GQRXX4,B000HASW0I,T. Frye,"If there's one genre that needed a boost on Sony's handheld, it's FPS's. Ever since the system launched, the system has had a very low reputation in terms of shooters. Ever since the release of the system I have played a lot of FPS games on it, in hopes of finding a game that is as good as a console shooter. Does Medal of Honor Heroes succeed at bringing a good FPS to the system? Not quite - but it came really close.

The reason why this game isn't quite as good as console FPS's is because it lacks polish in story. The story is non-existent, and your teammates are all look-alike US soldiers that shout things like ""INFANTRY!"" and ""GRENADE!"" While this makes the game a bit more realistic, your teammates never have any lines of dialogue other than these shouts. While you could blame the lack of story on system limitations, I can't see how hard it would be to add in a coherent plotline to your Nazi killing.

Once you get over the lack of story, the gameplay is the first thing you'll notice. First of all, the controls are much better than any other shooter controls for the system. Like other shooters on this system, you aim with the face buttons, and reload, crouch, and pick up items using the D-pad. This control scheme is actually done well in this game, however, and it takes little time to get used to them. As for the gameplay itself - it's a blast. Each mission is action-packed and chaotic, with tons of Nazis on-screen at once. Also a plus is the AI. The enemies in this game will try and flush you out of cover with grenades, and will kill you if you are rusty in your tactics. I highly recommend playing on normal or hard. There is little challenge on easy, and normal and hard bump up the challenge considerably, forcing you to think more about your strategies in combat.

There are multiple types of missions in the game, most of them objective-based. In one mission, you have a primary objective, and multiple secondary objectives to tackle. Most of the secondary objectives consist of collecting an item, but the real thrill is in the primary objectives. Whether you're struggling to capture control points throughout the map or assassinating Nazi generals, you are constantly getting shot at by a dozen Nazis at once. The chaos of every battle is stunning for the system, and the game handles it with no framerate drops or slowdown.

The graphics of MoH Heroes are simply stunning. Heroes is simply the best looking game on the system, with detailed environments and impressive looking explosions and effects. There are little to no graphical glitches, and the game runs at a smooth 30 frames per second. The audio is also impressive. The music is simply fantastic, with the main theme being one of the best songs in any WW2 video game ever. However, there is a strange lack of music in the actual gameplay. Some nice orchestral music would have made the game more immersive. Also, as I mentioned before, your teammates randomly shout out things during battle. It does make battle a bit more realistic, but there could have been some actual lines for your teammates to say.

The game will not last you forever, but it certainly has some great value. Having bought this game for $10 on PSN, the value here was outstanding. However, one of the main reasons I got this game was to experience 32-person multiplayer warfare. Yes - 32 players. However, I was saddened to realize that EA shut down the servers for the game before I got it. I was excited to play the online, but sadly, it is now impossible.

However, there is some local multiplayer options available, so if you have some friends with PSPs and a copy of this game, you can battle it out in multiplayer this way. Also, there is a Skirmish mode, in which the game pits you versus other enemies in a free-for-all. This mode is great, and is also great practice for those getting used to the controls. I must also point out that the maps are fantastic. Each map has different sniping spots and choke points, and they keep things intense.

Overall, Medal of Honor Heroes is simply the best FPS on the system. The game has great gameplay and graphics, and there is a lot of content for players to sift through. While the campaign may be a bit short, the game has plenty of other things to keep players busy, whether it's the Skirmish mode or the local multiplayer options. While it is disappointing that EA shut down the online servers, but the game is still a lot of fun.

The music (which consists of covers of popular songs from various genres) is great and will have you wanting to dance with them. I wouldn't recommend it or else you'll be missing your aim a lot.

I do warn that some of the content may be a little suggestive especially with the song ""La La"". I doubt the younger players will catch onto it though, but I put it out there for those who are concerned about it.

The only major complaint is that there's only one file and that you can't save manually. Everything is auto-save. Not only that, you have to erase the data by using the game reset method (which I have provided below).

It is very challenging. I must try most missions several times to succeed in them, and that is usually with tips/videos from the Internet.

Words of warning: The instructions are pretty weak and some times just plain wrong. (e.g.: Sniper rifle scope zoom is done with the left stick, not the right one as shown under Controls in the program.) That's why I often have to go online to get info about how to do things.

After popping $100 for a steering wheel, I was disappointed to learn that GTA4 doesn't support it, and driving with the joystick is far from easy, but eventually you get the hang of it, though it always remains awkward.

Words of advice I haven't seen elsewhere:
(1) You get around by jacking cars (hence the name), either parked or waiting at a light. Before jacking one, do a quick look around for cops. Sure, you can get away from them, but why waste the time? One of the most fun things in the game is trying out different rides. If you spot a limo, for example, follow it around until you get a chance to jack it. You can run the streets in dump trucks, armored cars, sports cars, SUVs, city busses, motorcycles, even forklifts.
(2) Drive like crazy unless you want to spend all your time sitting in traffic. The cops won't stop you for speeding, hitting cars/people/objects, etc. Other cars will usually try to avoid you.
(3) When being chased or chasing, don't go any faster than you usually do. The worst thing you can do is go too fast and crash, then the cops get you and/or the bad guys get away from you.
(4) You get money for each mission completed. Before starting a new mission, go to the firearms store and stock up, including body armor, then go back to your safehouse, stopping to eat if your green health bar is down. Once in your safehouse, head for the bed and you will be asked if you want to save. Save your current, fully-stocked status. You will probably bomb out of missions the first couple of times you try; the game lets you try again, but minus whatever weapons, ammo, armor, vehicles, etc., you lost. If you saved, you can instead easily start fresh and fully equipped by clicking Game-Load on the Pause menus.

Six months later: After playing a number of other shooters, I would say that GTA4 does have a major design flaw, which is that when you fail a mission, you must start it over from scratch. Many missions have 3 parts: a chase/follow sequence, followed by a gun battle, followed by escaping the police. It decreases the fun when you have to keep repeating, say, a long, somewhat boring chase/follow sequence, and perhaps a long, diificult gun battle just because you died in a hail of bullets in the ending cop-escape sequence. If it let you begin again from the start of the sequence in which you died/failed, GTA4 would be perfect, IMO. An example of how to do it right:  Bioshock.

Also, the penalty for getting capture by the police is far too great -- you lose ALL your weapons, plus some of your money. You are much better off dying, where you lose only some money to the hospital, but sometimes Niko just raises his hands and gives up and there is nothing you can do.",Astounding!,1224374400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Lang,"As a guy that still plays Sega Bass Fishing on his dreamcast (complete with fishing pole controller), I had been looking forward to this game for some time.  I nearly bought it when I got my Wii (after seeing its discounted price), but opted to rent it instead...and I'm glad I did.  It doesn't do anything remarkably badly (with the possible exception of landing fish with the net), but doesn't do anything observably well either.  While nothing upset me about this game, I found it remarkably easy to walk away from.

The motion sensitivity had a lot of potential.  In practice, it leaves a lot to be desired.  For the first 20 minutes or so, I mimicked the motion of an actual fishing reel...then I figured out that as long as the nunchuck kept moving, I kept reeling (meaning I could flail my arms around like a lunatic and still be reeling the fish in).

Landing your catch was ridiculous...I mean, how intuitive is the following procedure:

1.  Point the Wii remote at the screen, so the ""net"" symbol overlaps the yellow ""fish"" symbol on a black map (which reminded me of space invaders).

2.  Press combinations of buttons as prompted on-screen.  The size of the fish will dictate how many buttons are in the sequence.

Played it constantly at any arcade that featured the game. So when I heard late last year that a complete collection was coming out soon, I was pretty thrilled.

My copy of Metal Slug Anthology finally arrived last week. The collection features every MVS Metal Slug game that was released in the arcades, as well as the home Neo-Geo system. Along with the 7 Metal Slug games, the collection also features a few extras such art, music, and interviews.

Aside from some loading, the action is just as intense and frantic as you remembered from the arcades. All the big pixel explosions and huge bosses are there as expected.

Here are all the games:

Metal Slug 1

Metal Slug 2

Metal Slug X

Metal Slug 3

Metal Slug 4

Metal Slug 5

Metal Slug 6

Metal Slug 6 features different game-play features such as the ability to switch between stored weapons. The graphics have been overhauled. The music and voice also sound different.

Overall, this is quite an exceptional collection. The ability to own every Metal Slug game on one disc for around $40 is quite a deal, especially when you consider that these games originally went for $300 or more each on the Neo-Geo system. Also, you get a neatly sized package versus the original huge carts.

4,False,"05 26, 2008",A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B000HX1P72,Michael J. Tresca,"I've never read The Darkness comic.  I couldn't get past the fact that the character looks like a bad&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spawn/dp/1582408769/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spawn</a>&nbsp;rip-off and the quote from Brunching Shuttlecocks about the truth behind Dungeons & Dragons: ""I attack the darkness!""

The Darkness is essentially every Mafia movie clich mixed with the brooding atmosphere of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow</a>.  In fact, the protagonist, Jackie Estacado (Kirk Acevedo), looks and sounds at lot like Michael Wincott, who played Top Dollar in that film. If you've seen The Crow, you know that Wincott's got a very distinctive appearance, with his long black hair, leather overcoat, and hawkish features.  In The Darkness, Jackie is affectionately nicknamed Ratface by his girlfriend Jenny Romano (Lauren Ambrose). As you can imagine, having personal connections in a dark game like this is inevitably a liability, but I digress.

The Darkness owes a lot to films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reservoir-Dogs/dp/B000HC2LEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reservoir Dogs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/B000068DBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>, with random narrative from our hero, outrageous characters, and an uneven mix of action and drama. The first cut scene (created with all in-game graphics) gives a perfect sense of what's to come: lots of cursing, lots of gore, absolutely no respect for authority, and plenty of violence, all taking place in New York.  It's the New York of the seventies, when crime and graffiti were rampant and sane people didn't wander out alone by themselves. And you're one of the reasons.

The Darkness is a two-headed demonic symbiont that lives within Jackie and, we discover later, the entire Estacado bloodline.  In that respect the game is a lot like Spawn or Venom; the Darkness is a personality as much as it is a thing that augments Jackie's considerable gun-fu skills with the ability to create black holes that suck everything into them, whiplash barbed tentacles, magical guns, and snake-like mouths. In the dark, Jackie can summon other demons to do his bidding, which range from kamikaze critters loaded with explosives to gatling-gun wielding warriors.

Jackie's opponents have no such superpowers, and it's a credit to the game's creators that any supernatural monsters you encounter all fit the plot.  There's no inevitable escalation of the villain gaining superpowers to do battle; indeed, the villain behind most of Jackie's woes, Uncle Paulie Franchetti (Dwight Schultz) is as much a moral foil as he is an arch-foe.  Killing him isn't the point.

The game revolves around the issue of Jackie's soul.  Mob life is a violent one, and The Darkness contrasts the mythical honor of the ""old ways"" with the mad-dog frenzy of Franchetti.  When Franchetti starts blowing up orphanages, the older mobsters use Jackie as their form of vengeance.

The Darkness uses the New York subway system as its primary means of shuttling Jackie from place to place.  This makes a lot of sense and provides a sense of realism to an otherwise route form of travel that bedevils so many first-person shooters.  The streets are filled with entertaining characters who all have missions of their own to complete. Two of the most memorable characters include Butcher Joyce (Mike Starr) and Aunt Sarah (Norma Michaels), but there are many more and the voice actors are all superb. Between screens, and there are a lot of load screens, Jackie narrates his life and death to Jenny, which provides a humorous series of quotable anecdotes.  These are the first load screens that actually distracted me from the load time.

Despite the age-old Mafia tropes, The Darkness takes the themes explored in The Crow and Spawn and amps them up to eleven, without ever losing focus on sacrifice, violence, and even love. I wasn't entirely convinced that saving Jackie's soul was feasible (I earned the anti-hero rating from the game), but the very notion of redemption being possible is a breath of fresh air to the first-person shooter genre.","""I Attack the Darkness!""",1211760000,5,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

The formula was simple: three hit types (slice, lob, top spin), a two-hit serving system (hit a button to start the power meter, hit it again to stop at the desired power), and actual players endowed with their particular strengths, be it Tommy Haas' booming forehand or Thomas Enqvist's backhand. The original Virtua Tennis and Tennis 2K2 became the staples for gamers wanting an easy control system, without too much of a cartoon-y feel.

And little of that system has changed with the release of Virtua Tennis 3. There are a few new animations, like a jacknife return, or players falling to their hands as they try to recover from heading in the wrong direction. You'll get to enjoy Roddick's powerful serve and counter it with James Blake's powerful ground game. And achievements are plentiful and easy to come by; I had racked up over 100 achievement points in just under an hour.

Online play was reasonably well done; not all the animations come through as fluidly, and you'll have to get used to the occasional phantom racket, where an opponent seems to get a ball just out of his range, probably the result of a skip in animation where the dive for the ball didn't show. Hopefully, this can be addressed via patch releases. There is also a pretty awesome option to watch other Xbox Live matches, or highlights from other live matches. You can even take your customized character online.

The World Tour finally gets a personal touch to it: coaches communicate to you about slowing down on practice, congratulating you on beating people, and new equipment, while players you meet on the tour set up practice matches which don't affect your ranking, but increase your skill. The mini-games are numerous and entertaining--you get a new one about every seven to ten successful ""weeks"" of playing tournaments and mini-games. Instead of spending money to get new gear, you receive new rackets, shoes and accessories for free based on your tour success, similar to the Rainbow Six: Vegas gear-ranking system.

The customization options remain horrible in terms of the player's physique and facial features, given the advances in custom player options in all other games.

That means it shouldn't be compared to current FPSes, and by being a console release game it was most likely rushed.  Even considering that, the game is really bad.  I'll forgive the dearth of voice acting, the rushed ""still-picture-voiceovers"" substituting cutscenes, utter lack of character development and a narrative structure that rivals the literary/cinematic ""masterpiece"" DOOM 2.  What I can't forgive is some of the dullest gameplay seen this side of the 20th century for a game that the box cover says is rated 9.5/10 and 5/5.  These reviewers have been added to my long list of people never to take seriously again.

GRAPHICS/SOUNDS
For being 6 years old, the graphics relatively good.  Textures are crisp (even if it does have the muddy color palette of too many ps1/ps2 era games) and the framerate is solid.  Models move a bit stiff, but that's forgivable for the game's age.  Aside from the female narrator (whose voice acting is so-so) and the occasional troop chatter/radio message there's not much aside from alien screams, gunfire and explosions.  It's ok I guess, but the game just feels kind of empty.  That might be intentional with the whole ""mankind being exterminated"" theme, but it's not necessarily a plus in the ambiance department.  Either the main protagonist had his tongue removed before embarking on this mission, or any dialogue he delivers was so immaterial my mind has completely erased any memory of it.  With Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist is kind of a joke at this point.  With this game, it's just lame.

GAMEPLAY
This is where the game truely...doesn't shine at all.  It is trying very, very, very, very, very hard to be a PS3 HALO clone, and it shows.
- Partially Rebounding health meter?  Check
- AI companions troops (aka fodder)? Check
- Aliens/virus taking over friendlies? Check

I trimmed this list back from about 20 items, but you get the idea.  Even here it fails though.  I'm not even a HALO fan (never played any of the games after the original) but this game makes me pine for the innovative FPS days of 2001.  Aside from the graphics and stealing a few superficial elements from the 2001 release of HALO, this game would be considered stale by mid 90's first person shooters.

The fodder (I mean AI companions) are worse than useless, as you generally only notice them when they're actively causing you harm (more than once I got trapped in a corner or between them and a structure, unable to escape until the enemies did me the favor of killing them.  The enemies all have instantaneous perfect accuracy; as in they run, stop to fire perfectly at you, and run again.  Even when you're behind large cover, they put all their bullets into the spot you're in, and fire the instant before you break cover.  This was incredibly difficult to deal with until you learn to take advantage of their AI routine (ie learning there's always exactly 2 seconds between their volleys, etc), then it just becomes tedious as even the standard enemy you'll face 10s of thousands of in the game is a bullet sponge requiring 20-30 shots.

Some of the alien weapons in this game are neat, but hardly enough to make the game worth playing.  It's compounded by the face that for the first half/third of the game you only get one to play with, and it's not that good in the context of the game.

To summarize: the game is terrible.  This is one of the few games I can honestly say I'm sorry to have forced myself to play.  If you've played any first person shooter since about 1995, you've played a much better game.  Steer clear of this.",Terrible letdown for a very highly-reviewed game,1344902400,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5,False,"08 9, 2007",A194GQYVY9HXUP,B000JLIXIG,Ray-Review,"Resistance is one of those games that are worth buying a system for. Sounds like a lot but it s a very good game. The Playstation 3 isn't exactly the system to buy right now, The Nintendo Wii is a lot cheaper and has the most innovative gameplay a system can have, and the XBox 360 has a year over the PS3 with almost triple the library that the PS3 has right now. But even with all that, the PS3 is still a system that has the most potential out of the 3, once the games come in its gonna be on.

Now the actual game is a great one, the story isn't exactly the best or the most original but it does its job. The graphics are great but still lacks the graphical power of games like ""Gears of War"". The game has great controls, that should feel natural to people that have played FPS shooters on the PS2, even to those that haven't played the controls will feel like second nature once you play 5 minutes through, plus the game makes good use of the new Six-Axis controller (Example; when an enemie jumps on you, you can shake the controller to shake off the enemy). Since this game is from the same people that brought you ""Ratchet & Clank"" the weapons in this game are unique and very fun to play with, each weapon has a special secondary fire for example the Shotgun has a double fire, Sniper Rifle can slow down time for better accuracy and the most stand out weapon of the game is the AUGER which can shoot through walls and can create a shield for its secondary fire. The sound/music in this game isn't exactly that special especially compared to the ""Metal Gear Solid"" series.

Another thingabout this game is the ONLINE PLAY, online for this game is one of the best supporting up to 40 players playing at once. There are about 8 different levels with different settings depending on the number of players. The Pace online is crazy as f*** especially when there are a lot of people, you can also customize your character for online with plenty of options, honestly I Like this better than Halo's online play (People are gonna hate me) the reason is because even though the physics in this game aren't exactley realistic, the pace and the delivery is a lot more friendly than Halo's. All in all this game isn't exactley a killer app FPS like Halo, but it has a special feel to it that you can't copy their style or gameplay, so if you have a Playstation 3 and don't have this game, get it right away.","WITHOUT a dOUBT , tha Best Game for the PS3 RIGHT NOW",1186617600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The only way to get more characters on your side is to convert them. Hence, the spiritual warfare aspect of the game. You can train your converts to be pastors, missionaries, gospel singers, prayer warriors, etc. you can also have them build buildings to house more converts to training, house and feed them. This sounds like a lot of micromanaging and it is. The point and click aspect is only fun for so long. Not to mention the fact that the Ai is a little dim, and you constantly have to tell them what to do without them doing it themselves.

One nice part of the game is its mapped view of New York City. However, the streets feel constricted so you cannot move your character otherwise enormous army around very easily. Plus even though New York is mapped, there are limited varieties of the buildings. That might be okay if you could earn them, but the game only lets you get what it will let you.

The characters all look the same even after you convert them. They do change to the same outfit after awhile, but it's still a pain to tell them apart.

The game does offer online play but only to play as the peacekeeping forces. You also gain access to all their powers. Like doctors and colleges-oh I'm so scared!

The game is well crafted to be a decent RTS game without being annoying on the Christian angle. This is at least more interesting than The Bible Game. But I still give it the same score because of the poor graphics, micromanagement and repetitive, boring game play. If you're buying this game for its fun-factor and not it's religious content, you're going to regret paying for it.

However, every aspect of it is extraordinarily well crafted, from the character design, to the acting, to the gameplay. I think that the cut scenes offer the most convincing digital characters that I've yet seen in a game. In particular, Andy Serkis manages to give the Raven King a bit more depth than the usual fantasy game Dark Lord, and Kai is also a wonderful character. The gameplay is a lot of fun, with an excellent balance between Nariko's hack/slashing and Kai's running and sniping. Both characters are great fun to play, and the ""aftertouch"" system, in which you use the PS3's motion-sensitive controller to ""fly"" projectiles directly to their target, works extraordinarily well, although I was less impressed by the other use of motion-sensing, in which you have to jerk the controller to initiate an air combo. There are a few nice bits in which you have to hit particular buttons or joystick moves as they flash onto the screen in order to complete a complex sequence of actions, although I did not think that this mechanism was used as well as in God of War. Despite the beauty of the game, there are some indications that the developers faced performance problems implementing it on the PS3. While Nariko's fighting moves seem very well conceived, she looks a bit ""framey"" in action; I'm not sure what would be needed to make it look better--perhaps motion blur or  a faster frame rate. There are also some odd problems with flickering shadows, although the lighting overall is very impressive.

As a short, expensive game, it is a prime candidate for a rental. Nevertheless, it is enough fun to play, and there is enough depth to Nariko's fighting techniques, that I expect to play it  again, so I'm not sorry that I bought it.",Short but lovely,1190851200,,,

Most of our games...we get bored with after a while, turn around to sell them used on Ebay. However, this game is a keeper. My 5 year old and myself, cannot get enough of this game. It's so adorable and the 3-D is awesome. The graphics are so creative and neat to look at. As a non-gamer mom, I was able to pass all levels of this game (after some practice), however my child, who is 5, has a hard time getting past some of the games in the advance levels (the cloud-land and snow-land). There are no directions that have to be read, the game is pretty much self explanitory and the directions are within the game. Also, for those of you not familiar with this game, the style of the game is like Mario Brothers and Princess Peach (kind of, sort of), but easier. If you have a child 5-10, for sure buy this game for them. Each land has 5 levels. There are 4 sections/lands. Fist, Garfield goes through the scary Castle to fight off ghost and spiders, bats and more. There are secret passages through the entire game too. Each level has a secret door and a secret life. For example, level 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 all have the secret door, where you can earn more lives. Plus, there is always a secret area, where you can find a Garfield token, that will earn a new life too. You need to explore all jumps and doorways to find them. After you pass all 5 levels, you will then continue to lavaland (again, another 5 levels), then off to cloudland, finally to snow (winterland).  You'll want to collect as many donuts as possible, since 100 of them, will earn Garfield a new life. Also, eating the pizza will prolong Garfield's life.

The music is loud and spooky, always making you think that horribly painful death is lurking right around the corner. Most of the time it is, in the shape of enemies who have little knowledge of tactics but do have the numerical advantage.

Graphics are all right - a study in black, white and grey sometimes, but a touch more realism might have been nice to draw you more into the story. The rag doll physics are a bit creepy, as bodies fall in extremely unnatural positions and then tumble around inappropriately.

There are fighting sections, stealth sections, puzzle sections, a collection of enemy types, new weapons to find, new upgrades for your spinny death-blade.

Really, though, the main issue here is that the game begins to feel tedious after a while. The enemies are just a little too much of the same mindset so once you figure them out, you have figured them all out. The bosses are like puzzles, but poorly designed puzzles that give you little feedback.

There are ten chapters which is relatively short for a game - and with their save system it seems that you always have to start a load game from the beginning of a chapter. That can get to be a royal pain if you are almost done with a level and need to turn off the system for some reason.

How about the storyline? You begin as a reluctant soldier, almost trying to retreat from the assigned mission - but it's too late to go back. As you're in doing your deed, you get infected with a disease. This leads to your connection with the spinning blade of multiple powers.

In general, while we've had this game for several months now, we rarely put it in. There are always other games we'd rather play.

The Bad: Down right laughable voice acting and story, gets extremely repetitive after the first 5 levels, no online play, lame achievements

EDF is a bad game. Yet it's a very well done bad game. The game has bad graphics, cheesy voice acting, a dumb story, repetitive action, lame achievements (only 5 for completing the game on each difficulty), but does it right. What makes the game enjoyable are the thousands of giant ants you fight in each level, entirely destructible environments, and some strategy needed to play the game. You go into each of the 56 missions with only two weapons, and this is where the strategy comes in. If you have other EDFs with you you might want to take an assault rifle and a rocket launcher so you don't kill them. If you have tons and tons of ants instead of just tons you can bring a grenade launcher to do massive damage, and when I mean massive I mean MASSIVE.

Everything in this game is over exaggerated. You can shoot down sky scrapers with one rocket launcher and watch them tumble, take out a whole UFO with just a few bullets. This makes the game both funny and enjoyable. Thanks to many weapons in the game and the two player mode you'll have hours of non stop fun.

The weak part about the game is the combat. The attacks performed by your character (J.Sparrow) J.Depp and later on in tandem with Orlando Blooms Character, are pretty simple button mash combo sequence. You can press A for sword attack and X for punch attack .Also after filling up a portion of your finish meter you can perform a finishing kill by pressing the buttons that will flash on the screen ,to do a finish move you will see a prompt on screen telling you which button to press in sequence to perform a finish kill. Which always starts as Hold LT then the press or hold the corisponding button prompted on screen. Like this for example Hold LT. then press Y ,hold B. Or sometimes just hold Y . Whatever is on the screen ..very simular to Spiderman-3 button mashing cutscenes. The only problem with this is its way too easy to just kill an enemy by just pressing A (sword slash) over and over too kill about 90% of the enemies. While the other 10% require at least one finish kill to eliminate them. You also have a handgun with (get this)  3 bullets.woo hoo!! So authentic to that era..lol.you can kill an enemy with your eyes closed because of the auto-aim, hold LT. ... The A.I. is horribly easy to kill. One time I tested out to see if an enemy would hit me at all. And he just stood there circling me without even hitting me or even trying anything at all, and I was right in front of him, finally I just pressed A three times and he was dead, Lame very Lame.  And these same enemies repeat themselves over and over, with some of them waiting there turn too fight me. Anybody who played ERAGON? well its nearly the same here in this game. With Pirates only being slightly less lame....Another combat form is when you meet a boss type character you go into 'DUEL' mode . The camera switches into side scroll mode simular to Mortal Combat. But thats where the comparison ends . There's 3 Circles on the left or right of the combatant . One being a high attack, oNe representing a mid attack, and one representing a low attack. Now get this when the circle turns grey its telling you in advance how the fighter is going to attack you so you can successfully  block the attack (how polite), so if you see the upper circle turn grey you push left stick up. And if you make a successful block it will turn green .Or red if you dont. Well this feature takes away the fun out of it as your constantly looking at the 3 circles more than the fighters. Which makes it unbeliveable lame . Its nothing like Soul Caliber or a Mortal Combat at all. There are some great features about this game which are the graphics are pretty darn good. Some of the towns reminded me of Oblivion. And there are some great fog and lighting effects. And the cutscenes look quite good. The levels are pretty much straight forward linear, with a little back-tracking here and there. There are some puzzly type things, like you play an organ in a certain sequence to get Davy Jones's key. Its pretty much kindergarden-1st grade puzzles. Kids up too 13 will probably LOVE this game as the combat is very Eragon-ish. But at least the camera is fully controlable so there's no fighting characters off screen. The only side scroll is the easy as pie boss 'duels' . Johnny Depp character looks incredibly good . As well as the squid guy and the hammer head guy . The graphics are a very strong point in this game. Another nice thing is you can switch between Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom in combat and control both fighters. Another nice thing is the soul trap sword ,its a flaming green sword that traps enemies souls for whatever eason other than achievement points and high scores postings on LIVE . I hope there is a cheat soon where I could play the entire game with a flaming sword, because it only lasts for a short period and to recharge it you have to find and collect mummified heads. Also you can climb certain walls,ropes,ladders,ships masts when prompted too, which is pretty nice. It is a somewhat decent game in the adventure part but the easy as pie enemies will have hardcore gamers wishing for more, but the kiddes will love this game. Would I buy it? Nope. Only if I had young kids.","Good Graphics , Weak Combat.",1179964800,2,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},
4,False,"04 6, 2008",A14NA0W8ESGDSI,B000MK694E,T.L.,"First I want to respond to the paranoia surrounding the game installing a rootkit. It's not true. They create a registry key for copyright protection (which is still annoying) but do nothing besides that. If you don't believe me just check out the Symantec Security (Norton) Weblog, they have a message about this very issue.

That said, the game itself is fun and unique in the sense that you're granted several abilities to use but you could just call it 'magic' and it wouldn't be all that different than other Action Shooters. What really sets this game apart though is the whole feel of the environment. From the very beginning of the story you instantly get the feeling you've been thrown back into the 50s. Every ounce of the environment helps reinforce this as well.

The general story of the game, without spoiling much, is that you've crash landed in the middle of the ocean and found this underwater Atlantis like city created by a rich, anti-government, and very intelligent entrepreneur of the early 1900s. However, obviously based on the nature of the shooter genre, something went terribly wrong.

The minute you arrive your ability to leave is destroyed so you must venture into the city. Throughout this very linear environment you read clues as to what has happened and have to make choices of how you want to behave (which affect the ending sequence but don't do much else in the long term). You also find out about plasmids which are injectable fluids you can use to gain the powers such as freezing things (why a city of people underwater would ever need the ability to freeze things is beyond me but it's nice for killing things).

What's really interesting about the game is how it can be pretty scary at times. I remember one scene, I'm knee deep in water, walking through a shadowing corner, I see a shadow above in the light source of someone, boom! The lights cut and I'm stuck in the dark with something I can't see and I can't move very well. You will also find that you'll run out of ammo very often (which adds to the experience) so that can also lead you to being on the edge of your seat as well.

The game is also visually beautiful assuming it doesn't crash on you like one of the other reviewers had. I'm not sure why that was happening, likely its the games interaction with his video card or the fact he only has 2 GB of RAM and is running Vista (which eats a lot of RAM).

Generally, I'd say it's worth the money to buy and it's pretty fun and fast paced but the general fighting is somewhat repetitive so while it's fun to get new abilities it gets boring at times. If action shooters are your thing though this is a solid game to add to your collection. It's no Half Life but definitely is an experience you'll remember.","Bioshock - Fun, Unique, Interesting",1207440000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The single player campaign is a pretty good tactical experience for those that miss the days of Raven Shield and the original Ghost Recon, although they've stripped you down to one squad to the tactical possibilities are more limited.

However, if you're like me, you like to play single player missions outside the campaign, or maybe coop with a friend or two, and for that this game is totally useless. There's no friendly AI squad mates in ANY mode outside the campaign, and the coop maps (which are also the only option for solo play outside the campaign) are pretty clearly designed with 12 players in mind. If you're playing alone or with a friend the odds are simply too stacked for you to have any hope, you just die and respawn constantly no matter how careful or smart your play.

Oh, and as an added bonus, even campaign coop no longer has AI squad members. That's right, if you want to play the campaign with a friend you have to make do without AI squadmates. How does that even make sense?

Despite all my attempts, I have never really been able to play guitar. I can play a chord here and there or figure out a riff or two, but putting everything together and making an actual song has always been a challenge I've been unable to overcome. I picked up Jam Sessions with the intention of adding a guitar sound to my music that sounds somewhat authentic.

Anyone expecting a Guitar Hero-like experience on their DS should turn away. Jam Sessions features no cover songs or mater recordings that you play along with like you would in Guitar Hero. Instead, Jam Sessions aims to teach you how to actually play the guitar (albeit on your DS) to your favorite songs, while giving you all the tools you need to create your own.

The game controls rather simply. You strum up and down by moving the stylus in the same way. Chord changes are performed by pressing the D-pad in different directions. For a single song, you can program up to 16 different chords, so you're not really limited there. The game is also rich with extras like effects (distortion, delay, low cut, high cut, etc.) and palm muting. Plato have gone to great lengths not to limit your options when creating songs, and it does not go unappreciated.

Included in the game are 17 songs (with 3 bonus songs if you enter up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right in Free Play Mode). Essentially it's a chord chart that tells you when to strum up, down, or palm mute. There are midi demos of the song included, so if you get stuck on a certain part you can actually hear how it's supposed to sound.

Of course, the real meat and potatoes of Jam Sessions is the Free Play mode, in which you are able to write and record your own songs. Granted, you won't be able to record the whole thing unless it's 30 seconds long, but if you came up with a really cool riff that you need to remember, the feature is a blessing! All you have to do is select a few chords from a selection of hundreds and start playing. Microphone support is also added, but don't expect it to sound like anything more than the DS' built-in mic.

Another thing not to expect is miracles. I could never play an instrument and sing at the same time, my brain just doesn't work that way, and it's no different with Jam Sessions. But the fact that I can play an entire song on guitar without messing up is a feat in and of itself! The default acoustic guitar sound that the game presents doesn't sound entirely real, but still more realistic than any other guitar simulator I've ever heard. If you have the time and equipment, I'd recommend buying an adapter to hook your DS into a guitar amp or external effects processor. I've already done so, and I'm impressed with the quality and variety of sounds that can be produced!

In the end, Jam Sessions is a pretty terrible game. There's really no gaming to be found here at all. What it is though, is an incredibly handy tool for musicians and aspiring musicians to have at their disposal. The developers have put a lot of work and thought into Jam Sessions, and I am grateful for that. I can't even begin to list the times that I've had inspiration for a song pop into my head, only to have it evaporate before I could write it out. Jam Sessions gives me everything I need to make sure that never happens again.

Having never played a Burnout before this one I was expecting something along the lines of Need for Speed, or Blur, or Dirt. Burnout Paradise features an open world filled with insane opportunities for stunts and outrageous chases, there's no linear progression through the races and challenges. Open-world gameplay is not really as groundbreaking as it was 10 years ago, but when applied to Burnout it enhances the feeling of adventure.

There are loads of different cars to choose from and different challenges such as 'Marked Man', 'Stunt Run', 'Cops and Robbers', 'Showtime' and many others. They are all very exciting, and the handing of most of the vehicles is near flawless. The world of Paradise City is scenic and idyllic, it's the perfect setting for mayhem. But I have to be honest, there are negative aspects to the game.

The fact that there is no driver to your car is kinda creepy. It would be so much better to see someone thrown from the windshield every time you crash. The customization of every vehicle is limited. And the mini map really, really could use more detail. But the worst complaint of all is the trophy which require 8 online players to meet in Wildcat Stadium. It is required in order to get the Platinum. I have tried many, many times to get this trophy but finding 7 others to cooperate is impossible. Up until this point the game seemingly gives away trophies for free (there are 98 of them) but sticking this one in there was pure evil on behalf of the programmers.

However, the most appealing aspect of the game is the custom soundtrack option, in which you can play your own tunes from your PS3 over the gameplay without losing sound effects. Why don't more games support this? Why???

Still, it's an amazing game with breathtaking visuals.

There's only 8 finish lines, but the route you take is always up to you. Crashes are nice, however the slow mo before you crash kinda gets in the way, and the camera doesn't snap back as good as it can for drive aways.

I was hoping it was more like Revenge, there's progression while free roaming, but without a story it just feels like your driving around aimlessly while knocking over fences & billboards. With Revenge you could jump in & out of the game & the progression went a lot smoother. If they let you jump to event it would have saved a lot of hassle.

It allows you to connect an Xbox controller, Playstation 2 (or Playstation 1) controller and a Gamecube controller to your PC through USB. The great thing is that you can theoretically hook one of each at the same time for 3 players.

So far I haven't been able to test the GC functionality, but I imagine it works as well as the PS2 and Xbox. These adapters are great for getting that ""perfect"" feel for retro gaming, and often these controllers are cheaper and easier to come by than their PC counterparts. So if you have a bunch of consoles at home, and want to use those same controllers on your PC, now you can. Of course one might argue that this means your controllers will wear out faster, but at least in the short run it will save you money and replacing them will be that much easier. Xbox controllers are harder to come by these days, but as of this writing, Gamecube controllers and Dual Shock 2's are still being sold brand new in stores (and not just the third party variants), because of the Wii's emulation of Gamecube and that the PS2 still has new games coming out for it.

I recommend this product, though there are other similar adapters out there for other needs (like if you want to use Saturn or Dreamcast controllers, or attach 4 ps2 or Xbox, etc controllers at once).

There is official software for this product posted on the mayflash website (it also comes with a mini-cd in the package, don't throw out that cardboard before you find it! though of course the website drivers are the most up to date). You can also download a free program called Joy2Key (which allows you to assign keyboard and mouse functions to joystick functions) if you are having problems getting your pads to work with a particular game or app. I haven't tested other types of controllers with this adapter, but usually these adapters are designed for the pads, sticks, dance mats and sometimes racing wheels. Other gimmicky controllers may not work (and lightguns will not work, especially since they usually require a CRT if you don't have one... but look up EMS, they make guns that will work with LCD, Plasma and projection).

Another thing I like about this adapter is that it has a fairly long cord, which functions like an extension to the console controller's wires. Like all USB devices it's plug and play. Some games though only work if you plug in the adapter after starting up the game (in conjunction to Joy2Key).",3in 1 Magic Joy Box (blue): Another useful adapter,1326412800,3,,

It definitely has its strong points.  You can save anywhere (why doesn't everyone do this?????), there's no frame rate problems, graphics and enemy AI are very nice, and the craft design is especially good.  I love the future-past blimps.  Weapons also work well and are mostly appropriate, although it often takes half a clip to kill someone if it isn't a head shot.

The time shifting, the game's big selling point, is pretty cool.  I wish the ""stop"" function lasted as long as the ""slow"" function, but you can't have everything.  The fighting situations encourage you to use them, too.  Often enemies are way off, and you don't get a sniper rifle until later (and when you do it's best to ditch it soon after the initial use is over for something more appropriate to what's coming), so your best bet is to slow or stop time and move to closer cover.  Not bad, but I like to hang back and take them out from a distance.  And playing with time is nothing new, so that hook for this game doesn't dig too deep (ugh, sorry for the bad analogy).

Luckily, the ""crossbow"" gun (no, not arrows, just the way it looks), is especially cool.  It has a zoom scope and fires explosive pellets.  The moment I got it I kept one on hand the entire rest of the game.  It makes the conventional sniper rifle almost completely unnecessary.

Otherwise, though, there's nothing really new or special in the gameplay.  The controls are bizarre at first, too.  There's certainly nothing bad about Timeshift, it just doesn't advance the genre in any way.  It's a very well done but unremarkable shooter and little more.  If you just plain like shooters, it's worth having.  If you're looking for something to really impress, this isn't it.  In it's defense, a thought just occurred to me, though.

I never got a chance to play NFL 2K5 as I was still playing Madden/NCAA 03 at the time.  After being disappointed with Madden/NCAA for the 2003 release I skipped over the 04 and 05 editions, and because it was so late in the season I decided to skip NFL 2K5 as well, planning on getting NFL 2K6 the following year, but EA changed that and I was stuck with the EA football titles for the foreseeable future.  I decided to give EA one last chance, and they failed again with Madden/NCAA 06.  At this point I decided I was done with EASports and since they had the monopoly I figured I was done with football games for good.

Then 3 years later 2K decides to get back in the football gaming market and I was very excited, finally a choice in football gaming again and true football fans wouldn't have to be stuck with EA's monopoly.

I picked this game up recently, in fact a couple of days before I got my XBOX back from Microsoft.  I was finally able to play one game last night, and I must say I am pretty impressed.

When you first start up the game, you are instantly prompted to build you own team, there are no predefined teams on this game so every team you use, you have to create them from scratch.  You are allowed 2 Gold, 3 silver and 6 bronze rated former NFL players to build you team.  The rest of the team is filled by generic players.  You have over 240 former NFL players most of them being all-stars during their careers.  Some notable names include Jerry Rice, Joe Montana, Steve Young, John Elway, Reggie White, Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, and Williams ""Refrigerator"" Perry.  While you might recognize many of the names included in this years release, you will also notice some missing, some right of the top of my head are Howie Long, Michael Irvin and Jim Kelly.  That is not to say the list provided is disappointing, 240 players is plenty especially considering 2K had to individually sign these players.

After you select your players and choose the generic players to fill you team, you are taken to a screen to select your city, team nickname, logo, and stadium and after your done, you then go into actually editing your teams uniforms all the way down to how many stripes the players' socks will have and the color of their shoes, helmets and face masks.  You can even change the colors of the team's logo.  There are tons and tons of different combinations you can choose and this can be very long and drawn out considering how much you care about how your team uniforms (home and away) look on the field, but the game already has predefined color schemes so if you just want to get to the action, you can skip this all together.  If you do decide to edit your team, then just know the menu is very cumbersome and admittedly not very intuitive as it should be.  In fact it took me a while to figure out how to change my team's helmet colors from white to black.

After your team is created it is saved and you are ready to go.  You are then taken to the game's main screen where you can either choose to play a quick exhibition game against one of the computer created teams or go into season mode.  I just wanted a quick game so I just choose a quick match in my home stadium.

The first thing you will notice about the game that these are not truly Next Gen graphics.  Even in HD at best they look slightly better than HD regular XBOX games.  But believe me there is much more to a game than jaw dropping graphics, and I found that out after the ball was kicked off in my very first game.  As soon as the ball was kicked off I knew that this was going to be a football game like none other I have experienced before.  First off the players move realistically.  I hadn't noticed and robotic like movements of them running like they are trying to make it to the bathroom before they have an accident.  The tackling animations are also quite more realistic than I have seen in other games.  There is real gang tackling here and not anything like the ""hey, I'm going to hold you, while my teammate comes and hits you"" crap.  There are no sled animations or seeing receivers skate to the ball either.  Even the sidelines have animated players that react to plays on the field and attempt to get out of the way if they see a player out of control flying towards them.  Other times, they'll step in and grab him to stop his momentum.

The game plays like football is supposed to be played.  No longer can you back up 30 yards and throw 80 yard bombs all day, because chances are you will be sacked or more often than not your pass will be knocked down if you're lucky.  Your linemen block who they are supposed to block and don't miss an obvious block just so they can go block a free safety 15 yards away who is not even in the play to begin with.  On the defensive end of the ball players react well to both the run and pass.  Don't expect 20+ yard runs on every single possession, if you do manage to get a long gain you better believe the D will adjust incase you try that crap on the very next play.  In the running game you have WORK for your yardage, you have to find the hole and hit it hard.  If you just dance around in the back field you WILL get your bell rung.  Take a hole and go for it.  Passing is also quite realistic and very rewarding when you complete a long pass play on 3rd and long.  The defense reacts pretty well to the ball and will knock it down if they can't quite get two hands on it.  If you throw in double coverage too often you will pay for it, if your throw is too late or too early the D will knock it down.  As good as the AI is on both sides of the ball, I never got the feeling that it was ""cheating"" like other games I have played in the past.  I remember in the said game, I would be running for a first down, clearly beating the defender and all of a sudden he makes a dive for me at the wrong angle and then while in MIDAIR, he body changes direction just so he can stop me; this is not the case in APF2K8, if you have a man beat you have him beat, and the only thing he can hope for is that he has enough foot speed to catch you.  Another thing I used to hate on the ""other"" game is that when my defender had the perfect angle on a guy going towards the end zone and I will dive towards him clearly expecting at least some contact between my defender and the ball carrier only the have the game take over and cause my guy to dive in the complete opposite direction of the ball carrier.  I can't tell you how frustrating that was!  But that is no longer the case in this game, if you have an angle and time your hit right, you will at least make contact with the ball carrier getting him to go down is another story if you are dealing with the bruiser gold/silver/bronze star RB's.

Another thing I like about the game is that the halftime show shows actual video highlights from the game you are playing and the same is true for the post game show.  While the commentators start getting repetitive after a while, its still good to go back and see the big plays of the game without having to rely on your saved replays all the time.  Other things I like about the game are the stadium mascots that do various things after the home team makes a big play, if you are the Assassins and score a touch down, the giant hooded ""assassin"" at the end zone will perform a stabbing motion, if you are the Firebirds the bird will squawk and flap its wings, there is even one team that has two battle ships that shoot off its cannons! In addition to this the crowd always seems to be in the game, you make a big play they respond with ecstatic cheering, if you make a stupid play, then you will get booed....loudly.  Another final thing I would like to mention is that if your XBOX is online while you are playing a game, you will get up to date sports tickers from the real world of sports.  Even though it really does not add to the game you are playing its still a cool feature.  It's nice always being in touch with the real sports world while I'm playing video games.

As much as I like the actual game, there are handful of flaws that are disappointing and one that is downright frustrating.  First of all if you already didn't know, there is no franchise mode.  So the team you create for offline play can only go through one season and that's it.  No continuing to a next season, and no tracking career stats etc.  The most you can do is take that same team though the same team again with a slightly different scheduled, or just create another team all together. In addition the Season mode itself is pretty limited.  There is not even an ability to ""watch"" other games that your team is not playing in, and even more, you can only bring ONE of your created teams into season mode.  This was a disappointment, especially for someone who primarily plays offline 99% of the time.  I've tried online play before with other games, and if you have read my last reviews you will see that I am not a big fan of online play, playing people I don't know, most of who are cheesers, whiners and glitchers.  The only time I will play someone online, is if I know them in real life.  The lack of franchise mode bothered me, but not enough not to get this game.  I have always heard 2K made the best football games, and if APF was anything like the NBA 2K series, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed in the game play.  The other limitation is a big one, even bigger than the lack of franchise mode in many ways.  You are only limited to creating 8 teams in the game, meaning that at any one time you only have 8 teams to choose from as you can't play with any of the CPU's teams.  This is not a big problem in itself, because I would have expected some sort of limitation on the amount of teams you could create.  However, this 8 team limit is PER storage unit, and NOT per profile.  This means that no matter how many profiles you have on your XBOX, there are only 8 teams to go around for all of the profiles as the roster file with your teams is not saved to individual profiles but to the memory unit itself.  If you have a memory unit, then that is another 8 teams, but a bigger problem is that only ONE roster file can be loaded at one time.  So say you create 8 teams on your Xbox, and your friend creates 8 teams on his memory card and brings it over to your house, there is no way your teams can play your friends' teams as its one roster file or the other.  If you friend loads his roster file to your game, then YOU have to play with his teams, and vice versa.  The only way this can be done is if you play over XBL, and in the case that your friend or family member live in the same house, then you are pretty much SOL if the two of you want to play your created teams against each other.  This is a big oversight on 2K's part, it's like they completely forgot about the offline gamer to focus on online play.  I can deal with no franchise mode for the first year, but only being able to choose from 8 teams at a time is a big minus.  I'm pretty sure person A's friend wouldn't want to be forced to play with his friend's A teams when person B spent so much time creating his own teams and vice versa.  There should be no reason why person B can't take his MNU over to friend A's house and have a blast pitting their created teams against each other....but you can't.

I agree that the actual game play in this game is much better than Madden has ever been and when playing it's no doubt the best football game I ever had the opportunity to play.  If you are an online gamer, then this is a no-brainer.  However if you are only concerned with offline play, then think hard before you spend $60 on this because if you don't know all the limitations before going in, you will be quite disappointed.  Personally I am pleased with the game overall, but to be honest the lack of offline features is quite a disappointment.  I am by no means a Madden supporter or an EASports supporter in general, but have sense enough to know if 2K expects to make in the football gaming market which they no doubt should, they really have to appeal to all types of gamers, both offline and online.  One strike against 2K from the get go is that EASports has a monopoly on the NFL and NCAA Football.  Adding to that fact, the suits over at EA are way too rich and have a very big fan base for 2K to continue to leave important features out of their football games.  I don't EVER expect them to outsell Madden even though to me 2K football's game play is light years ahead of arcadey, unrealistic game play of Madden.  However if they don't start to appeal to all types of gamers then many fans will have no reason to ""take a chance"" with 2K and will end up buying Madden instead.  Others like me who can't stand Madden will just do without a football game all together, as I have been doing for the past two years.

This game has a solid foundation with superb game play (which is the most important part of any game).  It just needs more stuff to go with it; and no I'm not talking about the gimmick crap Madden makes a big deal out of every year, I'm talking about things that will actually improve the game, (i.e. Franchise, ability to play two profiles created teams against one another).  I like playing with the Legends, but if the Legends are what's holding 2K back from doing a franchise, then I say scrap the legends and go with all generic players, many fans who don't care about the NFL license or using ""real"" players would still no doubt appreciate the game play.  Maybe even have a single season mode with Legends and a franchise mode with all generic players.  The possibilities are abundant with a little creative thinking.  A bigger issue is only being able to choose from 8 teams to play with.  At least give gamers the ability to load more teams from separate profiles to increase the choices!  This limitation is bad enough in the first release, and will be unacceptable in all future releases.

This is 2K's first year back in football gaming in a few years, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt this year, giving them some time to work out the many missing options.  Despite the disappointments, the bottom line is that this is a very fun football game.  However if 2K wants to continue to produce this series and have ""success"" with it, they will really have to bring it in the future.  I desperately wanted to give this game 4 stars, but my conscious won't allow it.  I'll put it this way, if you are an offline player like me, this game gets 3.5, if I was primarily an online player, then the lack of feature in offline wouldn't bother me so it would get a four at least.  In either case, it gets a perfect 5 for fun.

All that said, welcome back 2K!  It's about time we have a choice in football gaming again!  Let's just hope EA doesn't figure out how to license the sport of football itself so they can take the easy punk way out again by buying their way out of competition.","Not bad for the 1st next gen release, but needs more refinement",1186444800,36,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

4,False,"08 25, 2007",A3MA7SDWD1HJE5,B000NJH6YG,Jason Hornbuckle,"Let me just start off by saying that it was a mistake for the developers to market this game as ""Oblivion on steroids"" or to compare it to Oblivion in any way. That sets people up to expect something much like Oblivion, and Two Worlds really isn't anything like that

What Two Worlds is, is a game that's wide open, with a bigger area to work in than Oblivion, no time limits or order that you have to do quests in, an interesting magic system, a really cool way to combine weapons and armor to make them better, an alchemy system similar to Morrowind's and Oblivion's, and a choice to play in 3rd or 1rst person view

The major pro's to playing this are the alchemy, magic and combining items end of the game, the open nature of the game, where you can explore and do what you want, and (to me) the fact that you can finally fight from horseback, which you couldn't do at all in Oblivion

the con's are that the game takes some getting used to. Everything is not as intuitive as you'd like, you'll try to do something with the X button and it turns out you need to hit the Back button to do whatever it is, stuff like that. Things aren't as well-explained in the rule book as I would like. When you start off the game you quickly get points to increase your attributes and skills and if you don't do that as soon as you get them its hard to beat even the wild animals roaming around. That should have been stressed a little more in the introduction, I think

The graphics are good, not as good as Gears of War or Oblivion, but they're good. The dialogue and voice acting has been criticized, but its no where near as bad as that in Resident Evil or many other games. Going back to my first statement: if you're expecting Oblivion you're going to be disappointed. If you're not, I really think you'll like this game alot

My biggest problem is that the load times can be long (1-2 seconds) when you're moving from one area to another and that can be annoying if you're chasing someone or something and it suddenly pauses. Other than that, since I don't live or die based on ""next gen"" graphics or whether or not the characters say ""mayhap"" alot, I have no issue with this game. I think its alot of fun and I enjoy the freedom to do what I want and the variety of enemies that can be found even in the beginning stages of the game

So, to sum up: Give this game an honest try, don't just rent it and play it for 20 minutes and then come put a negative review on Amazon the way 3 or 4 of these other guys have done. Play it for an hour or so, learn what you have to do to make your character work the way you want to use him, build some weapons, modify some spells.

Play around a little and I think you'll agree that this is in the top 5 RPGs on consoles right now. Its not Oblivion. Its close to, but not quite as solid as Morrowind. It may not be as good as Diablo 2 for some of you (I think its better). But being the 3rd or 4th best RPG out right now isn't a crime or anything. So give it a try and enjoy it til Elder Scrolls 5 comes out

oh yeah, someone mentioned that they can't read the font on any of the words when they play Two Worlds. I just wanted to throw in that I've only played it on an HDTV and I haven't had any trouble at all reading anything. The words are plenty big and I can read them from 20 feet away, sitting on my bed. I suspect that, like Dead Rising, you can't read anything so well on a regular tv because the game's set up for HD. Just wanted to clear that up for anyone who read the other review

*EDIT*  As of about 10 hours into the game now I'll go ahead and say that this game is BETTER than Morrowind. Other than Oblivion there is no RPG out there right now that comes close to how good this is.

The design for this guitar is simple. Five colored buttons up high. A strum bar and whammy bar. A tilt sensor inside. No special buttons, no fancy silver knobs - and it WORKS. It is a true workhorse. When other guitars we own fail and fall apart, these Xplorers keep on trucking.

The unit is wired, and it has a breakaway connector at the end. One end of that connector has a mouse-style input and the other side is USB to go into the XBox. So make sure, if you're buying used, that it has that connector - otherwise you won't be able to plug it into the 360.

The full length of the cable including that connector is just under nine feet. So fairly short. If your living room is long, or if you have a lot of people moving around between you and the TV while you play, you might want to consider going wireless instead.

It's recommended you don't get an extension cable because that would mess up the timing of your button presses.

The unit is sturdy. You can hammer the buttons and they stay responsive. The strum bar and whammy bar both hold in there. Most impressively, the tilt sensor is sturdy! We have the Stratocasters as well as these Xplorers and the Strats are notorious for having their tilt sensors fail. We've never had any problem with an Xplorer tilt sensor failing.

Are there any down sides here? Well certainly the Xplorer cost a bit more than the Strat does - but there's a reason for that. It lasts longer. So if you're really into the Guitar Hero / Rock Band games you probably want a guitar that will stand up to your pounding. Of course you could always upgrade to the real wood versions, but those get quite pricey. This is a nice mid-range compromise.

It's worth noting, for those new to buying guitars, that they are generally console specific. This one has a green X button on it at the lower left. Make sure you look for that when buying one for your XBox 360. Also note that you can't then use it on your PS3 nor on your Wii.

Well recommended for fans of Guitar Hero / Rock Band who want a reliable, sturdy guitar.

Yes, Wheelman has bad acting, bad dialog, weird mission structures, ugly faces on every character outside of Vin Diesel, but its also a lot of FUN.  And when it comes down to it, the fun factor is the number one reason a game is worth your valuable gaming time or not.  Wheelman is a ton of fun.

It's got ramps and destructible objects littered all over a massive cityscape.  It's also got a ton of side missions that offer a lot of replay value.  It's got your standard street races, but here you have a pistol that targets the 'tyres' of your opponents, and you can physically ram or dodge with your vehicle by moving the right stick.  It's got slow-motion shooting events, while you're still driving your vehicle.  You can play 'hot potato' and try to grab as many cases as possible and return them 'home' in a limited amount of time.  Sounds boring, but when some of the cases are located on the second story of buildings and you have to find a ramp to get to them, you have a great arcade mode that begs for a leaderboard companion.

It's also got a rampage mode (destroy everything before the time runs out), taxi mode, and several others.  The story mode is nothing special, but its still fun to progress through.  And the better you do on your missions, the more upgrades you can unlock.

The game threw in a ton of great little gameplay elements that street racers have been missing.  You're not just a faceless driver a la the Burnout series.  You have a character that develops and builds street cred along the way.

That said, the on-foot segments are pretty stale.  Just run and gun.  Nothing special.

Another point to mention is the 'T' rating.  Wheelman doesn't have the aggressive language, gory violence or sexual content that many other crime-based sandbox games (a la GTA and Saints Row) flaunt.  That makes it fun for teens or even preteens.  If you try to gun down a civilian or police officer, your bullets only push them away or hinder their movement.  No bloody deaths.  No deaths at all with the exception of other criminals.

You don't have to have a broad understanding of the cosmos to enjoy this game, but there is so much depth to be enjoyed by those who do.

Mass Effect was a bit nostalgic for me.  It reminded me that long long ago when I was a kid I wanted to be an astronaut and explore distant planets.  This game lets you do that.

This is a great way for shooter fans to be introduced to role playing games.  I've always been turned off by RPG's because of turn based fighting.  It's so boring and unrealistic.  ""Ok I'll hit you once and stand back and wait for you to strike me.""  When this game was first announced everyone hyped Knights of the Old Republic, also made by Bioware.

It was an excellent game with an excellent plot, however at the very beginning I was so disappointed when I turned the first corner and the game paused for me to queue up my attacks.  Mass Effect solves that problem.  Third person over the shoulder shooting is what the Next Gen is all about.

Don't be fooled though.  At its core this is still more of an RPG than a shooter, which means lots of dialogue.  Unlike older RPG's where you have to read through lines and lines of dialogue, the dialogue in Mass Effect plays out like a movie.  My only complaint is that you can't pause the game during a conversation.  If another character is talking and your phone rings all you can do is mute your TV and miss what is being said.

Edit:  Actually you can pause your game during a conversation.  Hit the big silver and green button in the middle of your controller and the dialog freezes.  This brings up the dashboard blade.  Just be careful not to hit Y.

Mass Effect isn't really an RPG and it's really not a shooter.  It isn't defined by any one genre of video games.  The best way to describe it is an interactive sci-fi movie.

If you're still unsure about dropping your hard earned cash on this game after reading all of the positive reviews and seeing all of the awards Mass Effect has won, then check out KotOR.  You can now get it for a fraction of the price it was originally released for, and it's backwards compatible with Xbox 360.

When you set the game to PRO which is a step above ROOKIE, the A.I. is ridiculously too good! You can tinker with the A.I. settings so that the computer plays terribly, but it doesn't seem to do anything. I was using the Patriots and played against the CPU 49ers. Now, Alex Smith isn't exactly the best quarterback in the world, but with all the A.I. set to bare minimum, Smith consistently passed for 400 yards regardless of how well I played defense! Also, the 49ers were unstoppable and made my Patriots look like an NCAA team! I thought it was a glitch and just the 49ers in this game, so I picked Detroit. Same thing, Jon Kitna was passing on my Baltimore Ravens defense for almost 300+ yards and were unstoppable at PRO level. Of all the Madden games I've played, the A.I. is incredibly inaccurate and makes any team you pick for the CPU become very invincible.

3,True,"01 15, 2013",ADPEAVHFCNLLC,B000P46NMK,Poisoned Blade,"The Main Quests are horrible, but the rest of the game is pretty fun.  So, if you're the kind of person that wants to blow through AC3, you will hate it.  If you take your time, go hunting for bears in the deep woods, engage pirates in ship battles, and go treasure hunting, then you'll have a great time!  Here's a breakdown!

Concept:  10/10
A sequel to Assassin's Creed 3 set during the American Revolution during an election year!  Add Hunting, Ship Battles, Guilds, a new graphics engine, incredibly smooth combat, and polish Multiplayer with a ton of extras!  This sounds awesome!!! What went wrong?!

Story:  FAIL
The story begins with a British Spy who travels from England to the Colonies to aid a network of spies.  The story then jumps to young Connor, then worthless Desmond, then teen Connor, then Desmond, then adult Connor, then Desmond again, while trying to cover all of the important events during the American Revolution.  You see how this might be a problem.  To make matters worse, the cutscenes themselves are disjointed.  You speak to a character for 20 seconds, then for no reason they make you walk down a hallway for 10 seconds, then you speak again for 20 seconds, then they make you walk up some stairs for 10 seconds, then you speak to the same character for another 20 seconds...  I'm assuming there's some sort of streaming limitation with the gameplay engine because this was ridiculous.  And let's face it, Ezio is a tough act to follow.  That guy was like a Renaissance Bruce Wayne (without the emotional scars) he had tons of charisma and was popular with the ladies.  Now we have Connor, who basically says exactly what is on his mind.  He's not terrible, but he's seriously lacking in charisma.

Gameplay:  Main Quests FAIL!
The first half of the game is a tutorial where you are micromanaged and you don't learn anything.  The mission objectives are things like, sneak past the guards without being seen.  Optional Objectives include - Don't kill anyone.  Well, the game doesn't tell you that if you do not have a weapon equipped, you can choke guards out if you sneak up behind them.  Then leave their bodies in the bushes.  Without this useful tidbit of information, you end up failing a few times before you figure out where you are supposed to go.  Most of the Main Quests are trial and error.  Now here is the worst part... When you fail these missions you almost never die.  Instead a message saying, ""Desynchronized"" appears on your screen and they reset you back to the last checkpoint.  So, you are killed by the HUD.  This has all of the dramatic impact of an Out of Memory Error - Reload.  When I get killed in a game, I want the enemies to kill me.  I want to go down swinging like a champ.  Maybe I make a mistake.  Maybe I get overwhelmed.  But I should never get killed by the HUD.  It ruins immersion.  Why bother spending time on AI, enemies, animations, etc... when you're getting killed by TEXT MESSAGES?!  It's ridiculous.  You also get killed by GIANT TIMERS and B BUTTON Prompts.  I'd rather see myself get killed in an explosion or mauled to death by wolves.  Sigh...

Gameplay:  Side Quests - 7/10
There are forts you can take over, there are assassination missions, there are ""liberation missions"" where you can free zones of the cities from Templar influence.  These are pretty fun because you can handle them creatively.  You can use stealth, weapons, brute force, traps, etc...  They're fun because they actually feel like open ended gameplay and if you do get killed, it's by enemies.

Gameplay:  Combat - 8/10
Combat has been streamlined a bit, so here's the gist.  You have a parry button.  You have a quick attack button.  You have an attack button.  There are two types of enemies.  I'll call them Grunts and Elites.  When Grunts attack, you can PARRY their attack, then kill them.  When Grunts are standing nearby, you can kill them with an attack.  It's very simple.  Now with the Elites, you must use a quick attack to knock them off balance.  This is a jab to the throat or a kick to the knee...  When they're off balance, they're just like Grunts.  Easy to Counter, Easy to Kill.  Once you get the hang of it, Connor can easily take down 30 Bad Guys.  Occasionally enemies do fire muskets at you and if you're quick, you can use an enemy as a human shield, which is fun.  The animations are great, but the combat does feel like it's missing some depth.

Gameplay:  Stealth - 6/10
Connor is so powerful, there's no reason to use stealth unless it's an auto-fail mission.  There are some new stealth moves like hiding in bushes, or hiding behind a corner and whistling to draw the attention of a guard.  When he comes close you can take him out.  But when enemies see you, there are a TON OF THEM.  It takes a while to run to safety.

Gameplay:  Ship Battles - 10/10
Epic, Beautiful, Clear Rules, Cinematic!  The Ship Battles are awesome and your ship is upgradeable.  (This is the only real money sink in the game.)  You usually do battle with other ships on the high seas.  The faster you move, the larger your turning radius.  You have 3 speeds.  Stop, Half Sail, and Full Sail.  So, the slower you go, the sharper your turns.  In Combat, you can ram ships, fire your cannons, or aim smaller guns to do minor damage, sink small boats, or hit an exposed powder keg to destroy a ship.  Defensively, you can avoid damage by pressing X when the enemies fire at you.  Before they fire, you can see a red highlight, marking the path of their cannon fire.  For your cannons, you see a white highlight.  So, watch your turns, get the enemy in your white and try to stay out of their red.  It's pretty simple, but feels EPIC!

Gameplay:  The Homestead - 6/10
Connor can recruit artisans to help out on his land.  They have their own quests and when you help these people, you get upgrades.  These upgrades help with your crafting.  There are dozens of recipes in the game and you can get materials, make goods, and trade them with the cities.  Once you figure out that there's really nothing to buy in the game, you stop doing this.

Gameplay:  Multiplayer - 9/10
Multiplayer has been revamped and it's a lot smoother.  You basically hunt down enemies while enemies are hunting you.  Try to assassinate them as inconspicuously as possible.  The better your technique, the higher your score.  Blend in with crowds, ambush them from rooftops, hide behind cover...  As you are playing, there are tons of upgrades to buy for your multiplayer character.  New abilities like smoke bombs, poison darts, disguises...  There are team and solo modes.  It's really easy to get hooked for days!

Graphics: - 9/10
The Assassin's Creed series has always had great graphics.  AC3 is no exception.  The environments, effects, characters, weather effects, animations are all great!  There's only one flaw in the entire game.  It looks like every character is wearing contact lenses with white paint on them.  Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes takes on a whole new meaning.

Sound: - 7/10
The action is highlighted by great sound effects, but the soundtrack is a bit lacking.  In AC2, there were some great tracks with memorable music.  In AC3, the background music is just sorta there.

Maturity:  Older Teens  There's no nudity or anything, but there's some strong language and violent assassinations.

Replay Value:  9/10
This is a fairly huge game that you can blow through in 12 hours or do all of the fun side quests and enjoy it for 24 hours.  There're also some really fun and addicting Multiplayer Modes.

Overall:  6.5/10
Assassin's Creed 3 can be a fun experience, but you have to go out of your way to find it.  If you start the game and realize that you aren't having fun, forget about the main quests and join the Hunting Club, Battle Pirates on the High Seas, Search for Treasure, or play Multiplayer.  The ending of the game is pretty awful too, don't force yourself to stick to the Main Missions if you aren't enjoying them.

Buy it cheap if you want to get the most out of the game and enjoy all of the side missions.
Buy it cheap if you liked the Multiplayer of AC2 and want more.
Rent it if you have 12-15 hours to blow through the main quest (but this is not the way to enjoy the game.)
Avoid it if you need a good story or a charismatic main character.
Avoid it if you hate insta-fail missions (like Splinter Cell 1).
Avoid it if you need immersion.  The death by HUD stuff will really annoy you.",Strangest AAA Game I Have Ever Played...,1358208000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

One thing I loved about AC2 was climbing to the top of all the buildings to Sync locations, this is boring, and to be expected for early colonial America.  They really should have never done AC in this early of America. They should have kept it somewhere in early Europe with better churches, and building to climb. Not to mention much better architecture. I couldn't wait to continue the story on AC2, I'm going to have a hard time finishing this game.

There's so much to do and so much variety here that you easily lose all track of time while playing.  Liberation missions (for recruits), enemy forts you find and clear out, trinkets/treasures/feathers, Almanac pages to chase down, Naval missions, Assassination contracts, Hunting animals, tree running - you can hunt and take out enemies from trees...

The new income system w/ Homestead missions is brilliant... using convoys to trade your crafted materials.... (then sometimes having to defend an attacked convoy en route) - PURE FUN. Also attacking enemy convoys for a hefty reward :)

The BEST new feature imo is the new Combat system and animations/combo kill moves they give Connor.  Wow!  It makes fighting a pure pleasure to watch.  Connor is a more brutal fighter and kills are very satisfying.
Combat is also harder in a way - there's no magic potions to drink during fights if you're losing. There's also no Kill Streak to just wipe out a mass of enemies - you can kill about 3 and then the streak ends.  Enemies shoot at you so you can try to grab a human shield in time if someone is nearby.

Great new weapons too- the blades aren't as damaging as other weapons so you may want to use that kool tomahawk or Iron Dagger - & check out that Rope Dart! :D
The kill animations are different with each weapon so I switched them up to see what he does.  Nothing short of awesome - it makes me wish Ezio was beefed up like that.  He missed out.

They've beefed up this game - it's not as easy as ACR was (for me).  More guards in strategic places make stealth more difficult...

There are many things in ACIII that I wish the previous Trilogy had but each game is a work of art in its own right and I love different things about every one.

Graphics blew me away - that Frontier area was just breathtaking to me.... the weather changes... wow.  I loved the city of NY too.  In winter, it almost looked like a Christmas card.

The only real con's to speak of are few - 2 of the most prominent are the bugs/glitches people have experienced (I've had nothing major other than some minor glitches I'm Ok with - what open world game doesn't have some?).  There are 2 patches out now that hopefully clear that up for people w/ problems.

The 2nd is lack of ambient music in free roam.  Since you do so much free roaming, it does affect my experience at least up to Level 7 where there's less music.  I get this empty/hollow feeling with dead silence in the city of Boston & the other areas that should have some background music or something going on.  It does affect tone/mood for me.
I believe AC games need strong soundtracks to carry the game and make them special. (just my preference).

There are other minor things that need some tweaking:

The secondary weapons are a little sluggish when using (longer range weapons: bow, gun, poison darts).  Every once in awhile I had problems using them. (Weapon's wheel also has some lag time opening up, nothing major)

Horses.  They're worse to handle than previous games.  I only use them when I have a flat surface to run on - a main road etc.
But thankfully there's fast travel to many areas, so you can bypass that.

They streamlined climbing and free-running so they aren't as tedious anymore (to where your fingers hurt from so much control use in micro-managing your movement - made me thankful for that handy Hookblade in ACR!) but the drawback ends up being that you now seem to gravitate to climbing everything you run by if you're close enough.  It's blown a few stealth missions and chases as I ran up a building instead of turning a corner in a chase. :/

Another minor thing, text was hard to read on the screen - small white text on white/light backgrounds is hard to read, so I sometimes didn't know what my objectives were.  Had to quickly pull up the map to read the notify box separately.

The game is super long if you do more than just blow thru main missions and skip Liberation & Homesteading.
Side missions & random missions (in NY) are all over the place I had well over 40 hours in without finishing the main story yet.

In some ways ACIII surpasses previous AC games *esp. combat when you learn the new mechanics, but they are each awesome in their own right in different ways.  It has high replay value and I really enjoyed the story and Connor.
(Desmond's missions are also lots better than in ACR!!).

I learned one thing after the release of ACR and ACIIII - the AC fan base is divided on what they like and dislike about the series.  So when Ubi devs make changes from fan input, it angers some and makes others happy; they won't be able to make everyone happy with any game.  Always rent first if you're unsure.

GREAT GAME - worth every penny of full price I paid at release and I'll pre-order the next AC as well.

To top all of that there is portal which is very addictive and brain teaser. I had several hours playing it, its really amazing. Basically you need to solve some puzzles in it, but its not that easy. you have a gun that shoots portals for you to teleport through.

I was actually somewhat disappointed in this game, I hate to say.  I looked forward to this for over a year.

First the good.  Graphics are very good even with the low to medium settings I was required to use because of my system.  Audio, for the most part, was excellent.  AI was a slight step up from other games in the genre, but not as much as I had expected.  The game-play was engaging - at least for most of the game.

The only negative aspect in the graphics and sound department was the tremendous amount of computer power that must be needed to run higher settings.  Although I have a mid to high computer system, I was required to run the game at a low resolution with advanced settings set to either low or medium.  I couldn't come anywhere close to my monitor's native resolution of 1920 x 1200, even with all settings on the lowest setting.

What was odd is that if I let the game detect and set ""optimal"" settings, it would select a a medium resolution and high advanced settings.  But playing at that, I could only get maybe 12-15 fps.  So, the detection system was useless.  I had to tweak manually to get the framerate to acceptable levels.

I finally was able to get the framerate at an average of 35-40 fps - which is very acceptable, however, every few minutes, I would hit a ""bump"" and my framerate would briefly drop to 0 and then bounce back up to the 35-40.  Because this was happening so often, I had to take another step back in the graphics department and play on DX9 mode instead of DX10.

It was disappointing to have upgraded my computer to a duel core, 2gb or RAM and a 640mb Nvidia 8800 GTS DX10 graphics card only to run a game on DX9 with low settings and a low resolution.  And this was after reading tweak guides, turning off background programs, downloading the latest drivers from Nvidia, etc.  Very odd, and I suspect Crysis was rushed out and not optimized correctly.

The story and the characterization were weak in my opinion - characterization more so than the story.  This is a fairly straightforward FPS with not a lot happening with character development.

Levels early in the game were much more interesting with more openness and options.  As the game progressed, it became more and more linear - to the point of being very limiting.

There were a lot of glitches in the game - items floating around, things spinning.  There was a lot of clipping.  Some problems became quite a nuisance.  For example, getting an objective to clear an area and after doing so just standing there for additional directions.  None came and I spent the next ten minutes searching around until I found a hostile in a boxcar just spinning around.  He wouldn't die by gunshot, so I had to grab him and throw him to the side.  Once he died, it triggered the next script and I got an updated objective.

The last few levels were excruciatingly glitchy.  On the ship, I kept falling through the floor to the point that it was extremely hard to complete the objectives.  The boss battles were lame.  It appeared to me that the game was rushed toward the end and they just threw some things together.  The ending was a let down.  And the thing is, the game itself was very short - maybe 9 hours or so, I would guess.  You'd think they could develop something a little better in a few year's time.

I enjoyed the game, but it just wasn't as good as I had expected.  High expectation can do that.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give Crysis a solid 8.  If it were optimized to run better and without the glitches (which could be possible with some patches in the future) I would up that score to 8.5.","Almost, But Not Quite a Great Game",1195862400,56,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},

I am extremely disappointed.

First of all - I thought the demo's tutorial was a one-time thing.  No - your very first mission in the real game requires you to complete the same tutorial with no option to skip it.  After this - you figure the tutorials are over... WRONG!

Your hand is held constantly through each mission, and they basically walk you through exactly what to do.  There is no challenge to this.  What is worse - you begin each mission in the same position... having to rebuild the same exact buildings... having to watch your gold/stone/wood/food crawl up to the same exact level... having to do the same exact upgrades... and then - just as you hit the fun part and your settlement starts rolling along...

New mission.  Repeat everything again.

Though it looks pretty at first, and you might not mind building up a settlement the first time - having to do it over and over and over and over with no variety and crappy voice actors hand holding you through every step and forcing you to click through their dialogue is not fun.

If you don't want to read a long review, which this is - just notice these highlights. But I recommond reading this, especially part 2.

QUICK SUMMARY:
1. PAY ATTENTION TO THE SPEC REQUIREMENTS
2. You need a STUNNING graphics card.
3. Vista is a pain but doable with this game.
4. It is a great game, good looks, fun and good  interface.
5. Good 'bang for your buck'.
6. Seems very bug free.
7. Nice concept.
8. Better than the original.
9. Works better on the PC, ignore reviews about it on the consoles.
10. BUY IT.

PART 1:
So I acquired this game recently (it is brand new after all) but have made enough progress and given it a rigorous enough test to warrant writing a review.

First things first, it is absolutely outstanding in the graphics department. I do mean they are very impressive - personally I believe better than Half-Life 2 or anything equivelant. Better than on the consoles of course or anything else. I'm not really on about the faces of the figures etc so much as the shading, flowing enviromentals, dust particles, sky and the stunning water effects. I've played A LOT of these types of games before and this is the first one that looks realistic and doesn't either give me a headache, has glitchse or at some point just looks 'messy' or tiresome. It feels exhilirating to play. (SKIP TO PART 2 OF MY REVIEW FOR INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE GRAPHICS CARD STUFF)

The open plan feel of the game is fantastic. You need to get over the first couple of 'missions' before you can start feeling like you have full freedom over your Mercs future. The cutscenes are fantastic, nice voice acting and good looks.
The open battlefield is very enjoyable to play on, as anybody who has played Mercs 1 will know. It feels in my opinion very unique. Few games are 'open destiny' yet have such a focused and enjoyable over all mission plan which can be tackled so individually - with a nice number of other things to keep you thinking too, such as faction support or dislike, who you will ally yourself with if indeed at all, financial matters and how all this can and will affect your main goals of the ""Deck of 52"". The Deck of 52 overarching mission is a great and unique concept. It is as well executed as the original Mercenaries game and the map is even bigger, the scope wider and will take you much longer to complete. This is of course good news, you get more 'bang for your buck' so to speak.

The ability to know swim in water and drive boats is enormously fun and you start out the game driving in one. One aspect I also like about Mercs 2 compared to Mercs 1 is oddly enough I believe the game is easier to see. Mercs 1 was set in Korea and in jungle or dirt terrains. Since the Korean soldiers of all sides mostly fought in brown clothing it could on occassions be very frustrating fighting numberless practically invisible soldiers. The sky was often dark and cloudy and dirty looking, you couldn't swim in water and it was darka nd murky too often leading to frustrating deaths. Also in many respects it is a tired old concept of 'war in asia' for Americans. I suspect three high profile wars, Japan, N/Korea and Vietnam for the Americans in the last 60 years has led to a tired old story and view of that part of the world. It is nice to see an American company come up with a game set somewhere quite different and 'fresh'. I'm a Brit and know very little about South America as a result or anything about Hispanic culture. This makes it exotic and new to me and this is quite exciting. We've all heard about the Asian-American wars and seen the pictures etc but hear little and see little about the troubled areas of South America. The concept behind this choice of area is good too, the fight for oil. This new scenery, terrain, people and culture is a very interesting choice and the game is quite bright and vibrant in places.

The one thing i'm not certain about is the choice of a 'base of operations'. In Mercs 1 there wasn't really a Base of Operations so to speak, not so much, you more or less spent most of your time in the field and based with whichever faction you were with. In this you (SMALL SPOILER HERE...) - end up after the opening sequence of events being some sort of giant mansion that belonged to one of the important figures in Venezuela that double crossed you. I wasn't so keen on this to be honest. It seems a bit bizzare and unrealstic. However if you like that kind of thing, you'll like it. It is also a lot more about 'blowing stuff up' than the first Mercs was, not by a long shot mind you, but enough that I prefered at least from what i've played the the more 'shoot' rather than 'blow up' mentality of the original. Having said this, this is a vastly superior game in comparison to Mercs 1.

For starters, the game is for the PC! This was not the case or available in Mercs 1. This makes a great difference, greater use of keys, better accuracy and aiming with the mouse etc. The game feels smoother and the movement and aiming etc is incredible in comparison.

The game suffers from one issue however, only one mind you - that the original suffered too. This may be a bit of hint for those who haven't tried this too much but since i'm a natural 'Oh thats a bit hectic... run!' kind of guy I just found this out from my playing style. If you take the time to run like hell from fights, you'll never be short of hiding places to sit and let your health regenerate fully. This can make it sometimes impossible to die. I think the makers expected you to just 'fight'. But hit and run can make this game a bit easy sometimes. That means the hardest missions are the timed ones and the vehicle missions. However if this wasn't the case I guess the game would be too hard. And don't get me wrong, you'll get killed - a lot.

I rated this game five stars for fun and overall. I almost never do this. This shows how good the game is I think - it really is, in my own opinion, on the PC about as flawless as it gets. It is smooth, stunningly beautiful and amazingly fun. If I were you, yes, you reading this, I would buy it, but make sure you CAN play it properly first. It seems that to play this well you must be in an elite group that possesing high performance graphics cards and PCs in general. Read the Part 2 of this review to see more about this it is vitally important you do.

PART 2:
There is a catch. It comes at a heavy cost, you NEED a very very good graphics card. I wouldn't even recommend the nVIDIA GeForce 6800 GT, I would recommend the nVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (for anyone not tech savvy this doesn't sound like a big difference, but it is) you can buy this graphics card for about $230, that is steep I know BUT worth it and probably necessary. I suspect a lot of you reading this right now will have sinking hearts... don't be too depressed though. I know I shouldn't drop names really but I picked this roughly 230 dollar high performance graphics card up for 140 dollars at Circuit City. That is a steal for what you get. For more information on this read this card and why you really should get it read this [...]

This is on the page with the 8800 GT 512 card. The guide talks you through many from the start for varying prices. Have a read see if you think it may be worth it.

But when the game specs are given, pay attention to them. Okay? Don't look at them and say ""well i'm almost there"" I did that and it didn't work. I can run Command & Conquer 3, Lego Star Wars 2, Dawn of War Soulstorm etc and many other high spec requirement games. I didn't match their minimum requirements but I could play it. I had 1 GB of RAM and a Geforce 6150 SE nForce 430. I didn't match Mercs 2's requirements and even on the lowest settings possible it jerked so bad I couldn't play in a million years. I had to buy an extra Gig of RAM and the afore mentioned graphics card. With those in place the game played so beautifully I couldn't believe it. I had Vista not XP by the way, if you have Vista like me you do for some stupid reason need more specs. So trust me when I say, this game needs a lot of juice to play. I would recommend finding out if your graphics card can play this game before buying it. If you have the other requirements sorted but are not sure about your card, find out. The number like 5200, 6600, 7100 doesn't mean a whole lot because some are made for games and some not so FIND OUT. Don't just say ""hey, I have a 7000 series, so it'll work"", phone EA and ask them, they can let you know. Or search the net, I just couldn't find it when I searched but it doesn't mean the info isn't out there.

One more point, since this hasn't been out long support is minimul for this game on the web and EA aren't the most helpful on occassions. So I should mention that if you begin the game (and you have the requirements met) and get odd looking graphics, cross over effects, all white jagged ground or pitch black shadows, just in general it looks messed up - go to your .exe launch file (mercenaries2.exe i think) go to properties --> compatibility --> run as xp service pack 2 and check the 'turn off' boxes but don't run it in 268 colours, 640x860 mode etc etc etc. This only applies if you have vista, but don't panic, just do that.

Loading up on loot and upgrading your character is the name of the game, with varying classes to choose from as well that determine what view you'll be playing from, including first and third person.  The action elements are outshined by the RPG elements with Hellgate: London, but make no mistake that the overall gameplay is no less addictive for it.  What really hurts Hellgate: London though is that the game shows off it's best stuff, and then doesn't so anything else to match or top it.  It won't be long until the various enemies start looking similar and the environments become nearly identical.  There are noticable technical glitches as well in an otherwise great looking game, which only looks better if you have a DirectX 10.  The game's story is also worth noting, as it tries to weave in some comical moments that don't really work too well, and all together doesn't really amount to a whole lot as well.

The voice acting in the game is unrefined and it clearly shows that, because of fans railing against Capcom for the preclusion of said voice acting from the original Mega Man ZX, the pressure to get an English voice cast was just too overwhelming.  The only redeeming factor in this might be that there actually is some voice acting, period.  Good voice acting, though, comes with a heavy price.  Grey, the fourteen year-old reploid with no past, sounds like he's well in his prime.  Ashe, the fifteen year-old hunter, is reminiscent of Ashelia Dalmasca from Final Fantasy XII, except just not as appealing as Kari Wahlgren's voice role.  Characters that might not sound as bad include Aeolus and Vent, who have edifying things to say and don't sound nearly as annoying as Thetis or Model A.

Voice-overs aside, the game is quite intense.  The tediously primeval map system from the original ZX is not to be found here.  Thank goodness!  With more stylus abilities than its predecessor, Mega Man ZX Advent is just as interactive and innovative as The Legend of Zelda:  Phantom Hourglass.  The difficulty is, however, noteworthy.  There are many Pseudoroids with an eclectic variety of abilities that one must memorize in order to choose the correct one to proceed to previously impenetrable areas.  The Trans-On (or in the English version, A-Trans) feature may be overwhelming at first, admittedly, and yet the function is facilitated largely by the Profile menu, upon pressing Start and then L.  The menu is more complex, and with due reason--14 characters to choose from is no small feat.  Capcom has outdone itself this time, and the graphics are stunning.  Simply observe the different terrain within one level and you will see what I am referring to.

The background music is its hallmark.  There is no better soundtrack to listen to on any Nintendo DS game than to this one.  From the classic-Capcom electro beats of Grey's opening stage (the track is called ""Destiny"") to Ashe's sky-high theme (""Through the Lightning"" and ""Be One"") to the incredibly catchy Vent/Aile Model ZX Megamerge sequence (""Determined Eyes"").  Which brings up the cinematics of the game.  Although it should be noted that Ashe's story has shorter clips, they are still as state-of-the-art as they get, culminating in the Model ZX encounter and transformation sequence.  Check out YouTube for these. My favorite is Aile's ""Rock On"".  Capcom can be blamed for a lot things, which include an inept attempt at connecting loose storylines, and the unbearable difficulty of the game itself, but they should also be praised for their innovative graphics, control scheme, and their music!

The basic premise of the game is this.  You choose a reploid named Grey, or a human named Ashe, who become the Chosen One for Model A (which reminds one of Axl from the Mega Man X games).  You are to protect the world from a serious threat stemming with the same power as your Biometal from reaching its full potential.  Prometheus and Pandora are key villains who test your might by pitting you against other ""Mega Men"" or Chosen Ones, who essentially possess similar powers as yours.  If you do not confront the person who is perpetrating this series of events, then war and chaos will befall the reploid and human race, bringing it back to its discordant times dating back to Mega Man X and Mega Man Zero eras.

I won't spoil much more.  I hope this will inspire you to purchase the game, and I hope you enjoy it!

5,False,"10 11, 2009",A3H4JM6LH0GPJ8,B000QY9C90,Z. A. Recht,"It took me a while to get my paws on this game. For one thing, I don't have Xbox Live, so I didn't immediately see the appeal of a game that was being billed as an ""online shooter."" For another, I usually wait until games have been out a little while to see if the hype is true (and also for the price to drop.)

I picked up Left 4 Dead for 19.99, started up a campaign, and found I should have purchased this title a long time ago.

It's not really your *ideal* zombie shooter--I have yet to see one that meets my unusually high expectations for this genre--but it IS very fun.

I'll start with my few negatives, and move on to the positive.

Here's what annoyed me:

-Limited weapon selection. This is maybe the biggest disappointment, but even so, it's hardly noticeable once the action ramps up. Still, it's worth a mention. Besides pistols, there are only five weapons to choose from in the entire game: generic submachinegun, generic pump shotgun, generic assault rifle, generic hunting rifle, and a pretty spiffy lookin' auto-shotgun. And since the game tends to be either slow moments of skulking about where the pistols are most useful or frenetic rushes of undead where the assault rifle/submachinegun's hail of bullets are most useful, the hunting rifle and shotguns are of limited appeal to me, meaning that there are really only three weapons I can choose from.
-Stupid AI teammates. I know this game is meant to be played with four human players, but still! It's really frustrating when you're near the end of a campaign on Expert and your teammates run in front of your assault rifle and get shot in the back of the head, or refuse to move when you throw a pipe bomb and it unfortunately lands right beside them. Worse is when you have to sneak past a Witch. They just love to run up right next to her and fire off a shotgun blast at a distant zombie, thus dooming themselves.

Okay, that's all for the negatives!

Positives:

-I really liked the presentation of the campaigns. They're fun to play through multiple times, especially since the content varies itself. While the levels remain static, enemies and items do not, and appear in random places on every play-through. This means you'll actually take the time to look around in every play-through as opposed to breezing through the levels confidently. You don't want to leave a bottle of medication or a closet-full of zombies behind you.
-It's really satisfying getting a headshot in this game.
-I love the dual pistols for every situation except those frantic rushes or special infected. There's nothing like coming around a corner, seeing a hallway full of zombies, and emptying a pair of .45s into them, and seeing them all crumple to the floor as the smoke clears. And I get a thrill every time I spin around to see one running up on me, only to double-tap them in the chest at close range and see them skid to a halt at my feet.
-The Witches are nerve-wracking little wenches. The distant crying is a little creepy, but the closer you get, the faster your heart will go...the crying gets louder and louder and then that music picks up, letting you know you're right on top of her...if you're lucky, you'll spot her from a good distance away, but many's the time I heard that crying change to a low growl and came around a corner to see her standing right in front of me, ready to attack. You back off very fast in those situations, trust me.
-I liked the inclusion of the special infected. They not only added variety, but a degree of danger that kept you focused. The regular infected were predictable, but the special infected can come at you any time, and from anywhere--even the rooms you just cleared minutes earlier.
-I've noticed that either a Witch or a Tank will spawn in certain areas. This leads to some trepidation on my part as I approach those areas, wondering whether I'll hear crying or suddenly get ambushed by a hulking brute. I like that.
-The ""finales"" of each campaign are awesome. I love fortifying those little outposts and getting everything ready--finding the nearest source of pipe bombs is often a priority. Nothing's more thrilling or frustrating than being overwhelmed right as the rescue vehicle pulls up--it really can feel like a movie climax.

All in all, even if you don't pay for Xbox Live, I can recommend this game. The two-player mode isn't too bad, and you'll still enjoy playing with three AI teammates, too.

This is what I got out of it since I didn't finish the game:
The aesir are the protectors of the human race, unfortunatley they are fighting a losing war with the machines, which are the left over war machines of the einhander(which lost to whatever enemy that they were fighting) that are fighting anything that gets in their way (think Star Trek: Borg or the scifi series berserker wars by Fred Saberhagen). All the aesir can do is fight the machines to a stand still which apparently is causing their world to slowly be consumed by winter. In this backdrop comes Baldur who suffered somekind of accident that badly injured him and killed his wife. He is convinced that there is a new threat lurking out beyond the ""wall"". He is soon proven right and soon discovers a third meance that may mean the end of the aesir race if not stopped.
===========
If the above is a bit confusing and vague, then hopefully it gives an idea of trying to make out whats going on when actually playing the game. Now on to the game. I think this is what happens when a developer trys to take all the games that were popular over the last 10 years (with a heavy emphasis on diablo) or so and mashs them all together. When it works it works, when it works great Baldur is walking, air juggling death machine that that smashs through anything and anyone that gets in his way. Unfortunatley when one of the bits that didn't mash quite right pops up it knocks down the whole house of cards. Just about all of the issues have been mentioned else where, in great detail with with much description so I'll let the reader go find them, elsewhere. My main complaints with the game are the pacing, the dungeons and the controls. The pacing is more or less the story mentioned above, to me there was no real reason to want to go to the next dungeon or to want to go onto the next cut scene. If your going to copy Diablo then at least figure out what made the formula work and why people still play the thing. The story may not have been the most orignal or the greatest, but it made sense and finding out what happened next fit perfectly with finding a ton of interesting loot. Secondly the dungeons, for starters the ones I played all kinda looked the same, go down hall fight small monsters and then go into a big room where you fight a lot of small monsters and a couple of big monsters and then repeat until you get to the end where you fight a really big monster that is a nusiance to beat. Don't worry though you can't really die, it takes you more or less 30 seconds to respawn. This may not sound like a long time but when you keep getting killed because you get swarmed it adds up. Which brings me to the controls which lead the player to seeing the valkeryie slowly come down and slowly go up alot. If baldur is being nice to you then the sword work (mark of kri)and the gun play (DMC)actually work togther to make a fairly enjoyable combat experience. The problem is that pesky camera issue some game makers get and some game makers need to get. The actual problem is that the player does not control the camera. You have a choice of near, far, close and hit the Left Bumper if you want to spin the camera in the direction being faced by Baldur and if you happen to hit an enemy in the opposite direction of you have fun shooting or slicing air unless your lucky and the auto target decides to work. My usual luck was that I would knock the enemy in the air and the halfworking auto target would miss that and I would shoot up the scenery. Also there does seem to be an emphasis in this game for co-op, one of the pop up tutorials even says some of the bosses are better taken on with another player. All in all I had to give up on this game around the time Loki escapes just because the dungeon following that brought all of these issues to a head and had me banging my head against the wall. If you like diablo and don't mind dealing with a wonky control system and/or you have someone to play this game with in on-line co-op mode then you might get a good time out of it. Everyone else should rent before buying, I'm glad I did.

4,False,"10 13, 2008",A22CN41VJRVDOP,B000R0URCE,Nemesis296,"The long anticipated game from LucasArts has finally arrived, and there is a lot to be said about this game, both good and mediocre.

Let's start with the story...it's very short.  I'm a completionist, so I look for all the hidden objects etc in the levels, and it only took me around 15 hours to do EVERYTHING in the game.  The story you follow as Darth Vader's secret apprentice is actually pretty cool, but we don't really get to dive into it nearly as much as any real Star Wars fan would hope.  I finished the game with a ""Oh, ok that makes sense"", but I wished there was a lot more depth.  If you have played games like KOTOR and KOTOR II, this game doesn't even COMPARE in terms of story.

Gameplay is pretty solid, and keeps you using the force in the way the game intended.  From hurling random barrels pulling pieces of metal off the wall, throwing your lightsaber into the chest of a stormtrooper, and all the other plethera of attacks, lightsaber, and force combos alike; Force Unleashed delivers with the combat system.  It's smooth, innovative, and players will find that they will need to purchase the more expensive combos to do real damage in the later levels of the game, as the difficulty spikes in significant directions once you reach about the 5th level.  The leveling system that the game uses is very nice, although I was a little annoyed with the wait times you have to endure for each and every menu transition (going from force power customization...wait...lightsaber customization...wait...resume game, etc).  The other problem I have with this game is that it is VERY repetitive.  In order to progress in the game, you usually have to clear all the enemies out of an area to continue, and in some cases, this will mean you have to kill a ton of guys that are immune to 95% of your abilities, meanwhile you're being killed from range, or being stomped on by enemies impurvious to lightning and your push abilities.  There were a number of times that I was frustrated having to redo a portion of the game when the last guy of 50 from a save point killed me.  LucasArts definitely looks at your Jedi as a true one-man army, capable of withstanding any and all odds, no matter how ridiculous.  The game does however let you decide how to play, with the customization of force powers, combos, and talents (such as life, force energy, defense, etc)  If you're a completionist like me though, you will probably level up enough times to completely beef up your apprentice before reaching the final level.

One other annoyance I have, is if you decide to replay a level, you must rewatch the cutscenes at the beginning, which are sometimes up to 4-5 mins in length.

Overall though, LucasArts was definitely on the right track with the DMM, Havok and Euphoria technologies for next-gen consoles.  Gamers will find this very fun and you will feel more like a Jedi than any other game has allowed, but some of the limitations of the gameplay, and the incomplete story will leave the hardcore gamers and fans thirsty for more.  The sound quality is tremendous, and the graphics are just beautiful, especially on an HDTV.

Although they stopped making video game systems, they really kept gamers going for video games for other consoles like Playstation 2, and the Xbox. Now, the latest title finally decides which of the most beloved mascots is better, the beloved Mario or the fast and furious Sonic. This is the title for the Wii that could make gamers decide, young and old.

Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games for the Nintendo Wii, finally puts 2 of the popular video game mascots head to head in a battle that takes place in the upcoming 2008 Summer Olympics. This game, you can play not just as Sonic or Mario, but characters like Luigi, Tails who is Sonic's sidekick, Bowser, Princess Toadstool a.k.a. Peach, Yoshi and many others in a battle for the quest for Olympic Gold. The game features twists on classic races like Track & Field, swimming, fencing, table tennis and the hammerthrow. The graphics look very well while the action doesn't really deliver for solo players, but multiplayer action fairs a little better. You can also use their special battle features like power ups and special tactics like Bowser's fire breath, and Sonic's speed to help you through the game as well, and the Wi-Fi gameplay adds a little bit more. Although the gameplay isn't as bad, it just doesn't click to die hard Wii fans who want more outrageous gameplay they would get from Mario Party 8 or mario Strikers Charged brought excitement.

All in all, many more gamers are much more anxious for Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Brothers Brawl for the Wii. Mario & Sonic At The Summer Olympics isn't a bad game, but just misses the mark in fun and excitement for die hard fans of both franchises. I really recommend you get this as a rental, and see if you like it as a addition to your Wii library.

This does not advertise that it's compatible with Super Smash Bros Brawl anywhere, it clearly says that it is for digital output only and will not work with analog games. Anyone that knows about arcade sticks will not be shocked by this, all arcade sticks are 8 direction digital sticks, hence the oh so satisfying clicking when you move the stick. Brawl is not the type of game these controllers are for anyway. This lovely gem is built specifically for arcade fighting games...hence the name ""Wii FIGHTING Stick"". I have been playing Guilty Gear XX Accent Core, King of Fighters collection and SNK arcade classics with this controller for some time and I can honestly tell you that it's a waste of time to use any other controller for those games.

It has an impressive story for it's time, a fair degree of challenge without getting too frustrating, and actually will keep you busy for a while. The game forces you to develop strategies for dealing with enemies. Throughout the game, you get different swords for different elements and certain swords only work against certain enemies. Most bosses are only weak against one type of attack. The game certainly features it's more frustrating elements. For example, almost every enemy in the game can hit you with some kind of status effect. From poison, to petrification, to paralysis and they all can get pretty frustrating. You do learn some spells in this game including one that cures status effects but you end up having to leave the dungeon and go back to the village to recover your magic so you can counteract the status effects all over again! It can form an endless cycle if you don't get good at dodging enemies. The key is to strike hard and fast. Also, there clearly were not enough buttons on the controller to support all the cool things you can do in this game. For instance, at times simply hitting the A button could activate your sword, one of your spells, or one of the many items you can collect in this game. The only way I know to fix this is to de-select the other items from your inventory. Not a terrible problem to have in a game and it's easy to fix but it will catch you off guard from time to time. Also,sometimes it can get easy to get stuck and not be able to progress because you missed some obscure item earlier on in the game and you can't beat the second to last boss in the game if you don't max up your level. Considering you only gain more health and magic at each level, this makes no sense whatsover, but hey what did you expect? Many old games were cryptic and this one is only cryptic in a couple of spots so I'll cut Crystalis a break.

So when I do get ""busted"" by the enemy, and they're standing right next to me or in front of me because I couldn't sneak up on them, or sneak pass them well enough,  I like to be able to knock them out BEFORE they can raise the alarm, scream like hello kitty, or do whatever they need to do so that their buddies (or they themselves) can kill me.  Thankfully, this game has done a great job with the hand to hand combat so that I don't have to worry about this problem anymore. I now feel that I have a pretty good fighting chance to continue through the game without having to go back to the ""try again"" screen if I fail.

I think the improved close up hand to hand combat system is a great balance between stealth and action.  It made the game a bit more fun to play because I had the option to either stealth my way through a level, go in guns blazing though a level, or mix up both aspects of stealth and action to get through a level.  I really had a much deeper experience playing this game than I had when I played the first 4 Splinter Cell games.

Character models, graphics, atmosphere, locations, voice acting, music, gameplay, and story are all excellent.

3,False,"10 19, 2010",A180XX745S4DZY,B000SSPH3E,RPGee Wiz,"Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games of all time. I have logged thousands of hours on this game obsessively level building every character, mastering every skill, and finding every weapon through multiple play throughs over the years. Imagine my surprise then when a complete remake of the game came out, for the PSP. As a great fan of the PSP system, and its freeing portable qualities, I was thrilled to say the least when I heard the news. Unfortunately the reality is less pleasing. The game has several major flaws ranging from a hammey and self indulgent new script to a plain lazy lag problem.

Now the first one I am prepared to give a pass on for the most part. Any fan of the original Final Fantasy Tactics will tell you that the dialogue was a bit off. Some of the translations in particular were laughable, but I never minded. In fact I thought some of the awful dialogue in the game made it more charming.

The lag problems however are completely inexcusable to me. As a former video game tester, I am somewhat aware of the general bug testing process, and it is clear to me that this bug was just lazily and sloppily allowed to be in the final version of the game. There is literally no way I can see that they would not have seen this problem. It happens with a 100% frequency every time any graphical effect such as a spell is triggered. The bug is very bad, and very hard to get over when playing through the game. In fact I would say that this one problem took the game from a 5 star rating to a 3 for me. However I will go into that more later.

Graphic:
The graphics of Final Fantasy Tactics were never anything to write home about. At the same time they were always adequate. Unlike some older games, Final Fantasy Tactics had an art style which allowed it to age well. This is especially apparent when set beside contemporary titles such as Final Fantasy VII which looks very blocky by today's standards. The remake does not add any noticeable improvement to the graphics department, but because the game is on the higher res PSP the graphics appear sharper and rough pixelated sprites are much less noticable.

For those who have not played Final Fantasy Tactics before, you can expect a unique graphical style when compared to other Final Fantasy titles. The characters are all uniquely designed, and the battle terrain in particular is very detailed. Bafflingly none of the characters in the game have noses, but I chalk this up to a stylistic choice. All of the spells and effects have been preserved, with the addition of a few new graphics for the new classes. All in all, no complaints here. Everything has been preserved the way I would have wanted it to be. One of the few times when the Square crew doesn't try to fix things that aren't broken. Good job fellas!

Sound:
The sound of Final Fantasy Tactics, has always been one of its most unique and most well done features. There is a constant backdrop of moody classical music which is largely responsible for setting the pace of the entire game. The music does for this game what John Williams's score did for Star Wars, which is to unobtrusively lubricate the story line, and help make events come off appropriately. Though you hear the same melodies repeatedly throughout the game,they are composed in such a meandering and seemless fashion that you will be able to listen to them for hours without being annoyed. Very important in a game where a single battle can take half an hour.

The remake preserves the same music, and does it well for the most part but there is a problem. The sound effects in the game are its biggest Achilles heel. The minor problem is that many of the sound effects are slightly different from the original. I consider this a minor problem because it is one that most people probably will not even notice. I must admit that I only did because I have spent what is most definitely an unhealthy amount of time playing the old PS title! However, in some cases the effects sound duller, and sometimes a bit tinny. I am tempted to say that this is purely a result of the speakers on the PSP, and it really doesn't ruin the game so I can let it go.

The big problem is that the sound effects do not cue up properly with the graphics. In nearly every situations where an attack animation occurs, the sound effect is horrendously off cue! This unforgivable problem will likely plague you throughout the game. I played through the whole thing and was simply not able to get past it. Every time one of my characters cast a spell or used a special attack I would wince and grit my teeth. Someone should be punched for allowing this bug to remain in the final version of the game. This is the entire reason a company has bug testers, and there is simply no way I will believe they missed this problem considering how unavoidable it is.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is mostly the same as it was before, and that is a good thing considering that the gameplay is the most important and most defining part of Final Fantasy Tactics. The original game was based off a similar title for playstation called Tactics Ogre. For anyone who hasn't played a tactics game before, they can be compared to a much larger scale version of chess. The player takes command of a force of five warriors in this instance, and moves about a hex grid field combating an opposing force.

This is a simplification of the system because the real complexit lies in the myriad customization options at the players fingertips. Each character can assume a characters class which will grant him access to unique skills and abilities. At the start of the game the player will only have access to a couple of classes but as the game progresses more become available. In fact every time a character makes a move in combat he will be awarded a standard experience point reward which will eventually allow him to level up, but he also is granted a certain number of job points or JP. JP will allow the character to purchase new skills and abilities for his character such as the ability to move an additional space in combat, equip two weapons instead of one, or even use a potion automatically when hit, just to name a few. This system is where much of the fun comes into play. The customization is deep, and depending on how it is done will significantly effect the difficulty of the game.

The only new game play mechanics in this remake come in the form of a couple of new job classes. In theory this sounds great. Just what you want in a remake; the addition of more elements without taking any of the original content away. In general this is true. The new Dark Knight Job is not only cool but gives the main character Ramza the ability to stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Agrias, Meliadoul, and T.G. Cid who all use devistating sword skills. The downside is that the class creates something of an imbalance in the games difficulty. Veteran players know that when T.G. Cid joins the party, the game becomes a virtual cakewalk due to his massive power. The Dark Knight gives a character access to arguably even more ludicrously overpowered moves, and if combined with the right support skills, you will not likely see him fall in combat. On the upside the requirements to unlock this class are by far the stiffest of any in the game, and unless you are specifically training a character to unlock it, you will not likely see it for some time. I started the game knowing how to unlock the class and it still took me until early chapter 3 to unlock the class for Ramza.

Characters&Story:
This is what its all about in the world of Final Fantasy in general. The character development and interaction in a FF game has always been the glue that holds the whole thing together. Final Fantasy Tactics delivers on this front. There are some major changes in this department ranging from name changes for the majority of the characters to a completely new script. Now this is a point where I am stubbornly biased to the detriment of the game and I will own up to it. I really liked the old text of the game. For all its imperfections, it has a marked surreal quality. Who can forget such gems as ""Surrender now or die in obscurity!"" and ""If you had lived an honest life you wouldn't have died this way!"" From Ramza, or Agrias's poignant; ""Evanesence. What a sad word..."" It was nonsensical sometimes, but I still miss it. They also removed all of the exclamations that would sporadically pop up when a character used a spell or special attack. Some of these were great too, though I will admit most of them were inscrutible nonsense along the lines of; ""Live! Know! Become a toad!:"" and ""Life is short. Bury! Steady Sword!"" They could have at least retranslated these for the game, but they just took them all out instead.

In addition they stripped away every letter of original dialogue from the game and replaced with the hammiest community theatre calibre quasi-shakespeare I have ever seen. This quality will likely be a splash of cold water to veterans as it was with me, but after awhile it does seem a little more like it belongs, and admittedly it does make more sense than the other. Ironically the new old-english sounding dialoge actually makes certain characters and events even more difficult to take seriously, with enough ""thy"" and ""thee"" flying around to make the bard himself blush.  Some of the name changes are welcome and others I was sad to see get changes such as the character Algus who gets a name change to Argath. I just think Algus sounds better! If we always went with the direct Japanese translation we would have characters named Butts saving the world! Moving right along.

Cut Scenes & Voice acting:
These are a completely new addition to the game. The original game had nothing in the way of cutscenes, unless you count the opening which contains some knights riding chocobos towards Orbonne Monastery. The new cutscenes are not just good, they are breath taking. they have a very appealing cell shaded quality and the color pallette is perfect for the game. The voice acting is only in the cutscenes but it is very well done. The characters speak in a very subdued but believable conversational style and it fits perfectly with the mood of the game. The choices in voice are also very well done. My only complaint, and its a trifling one is that there aren't enough of these scenes. It would have been nice to get to see and hear a few more of the main storyline characters in these scenes. As it stands you really only get to see Ramza and Delita most of the time. Perhaps that's just me being greedy however, so I can't really hold that against it.

New Content:
In a remake new content is very important. This game is not a port after all, and so it is expected to have a few new treats for the fans of the series. The choices made are for the most part good ones. I think every returning player has wished that they could have access to a character with the Black Knight Gaffgarion's abilities for instance. In the original, only Cid had access to the awesome life draining abilities he possessed, but in the new game Dark Knight is an unlockable class that any character can learn if he earns it.

The Onion Knight class is appropriate in that it is a mainstay of the Final Fantasy Universe. In past games this class was sort of the basic ""Vanilla"" job for the main characters. its only advantages were that it could equip any piece of equipment. In the remake the class has access to all equipment, but cannot have any skills equipped. Normally this would never be a good trade off but the Onion Knight class allows a character to gain significantly better stat boosts when leveling up than any of the other classes, and so its more a strategic element for the obsessive level builder who wants to have the best stats possible. Why not! Part of the fun of these games is building your force from a rag tag bunch of wimps to an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction.

The New characters arrive in the form of two main players from major Final Fantasy Titles. The first is the character Luso from the Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2 game, which I am not a fan of. The character however is very handy to have around as he has a built in ability that lets him poach any monster he defeats. Poaching was one of those skills that you needed to get some of the rarest items in the game, but never wanted to waste one of your skill slots on, so having a character with an automatic version is a nice little feature without creating too much imbalance in the game.

The other new character however could not be more imbalanced. Balthier is a secret character that has access to all weapons and armor, all the thief stealing skills, all of Mustadio's gunner skills, and comes with a unique and powerful set of body armor and gun. Unlike Cloud from FFVII who also is in the game, Balthier is incredibly powerful. He has a unique shooting skill that lets him fire four times with his gun, and can basically do everything that Mustadio can do only better. The bad thing is that this nullifies any reason whatsoever to use Mustadio and thats a shame because he is one of the major characters in the story. It is nice to have a main character than can steal, as you never know when you will need to pilfer some rare weapon or armor off an enemy, but I feel they went a bit overboard on his other abilities.

As a final overview, I would like to state that although this game had a lot of potential to be one of the best remakes ever, its unforgivable lagging and sound bugs make it hard to get through. Unfortunate, because otherwise its a flat improvement over the original otherwise. After playing it all the way through to the end, I found myself not loving the current experience, but rather feeling sadly nostalgic for the original with all its bizzare dialoge and strange characterizations. Luckily for us change fearing old school gamers, Sony has seen fit to release a direct port of the old game available to download directly to your PSP from their store. For me it was well worth doing. So I shelved the War of the Lions, and loaded the original up instead, and the first time I had Agrias Stasis Sword some poor chump it all went smoothly, and it felt good...

Capcom and Street Fighter style like game.

The story starts outs when Spiderman is suddenly ambushed by different villians from his rogue gallery of villians (aka Sandman, Green Goblin, Dr. Octopuss, Venom, Scorpion, and so forth) when originally rescued by the ""New Goblin"" from the Sam Rami movie Franchise (Yes, we all know he died in the 3rd Spiderman along with some of the villians being killed off in the previous movies, but again this is non-canicol). Then when out of nowhere they are all suddenly attacked by a unknown Mysterious Villians lacky's and taken prisoner, just when it looks like Spiderman is about to be captured he is at the last moment saved by a transport beam by Nick Fury of SHIELD (The Classic Marvel Universe Nick Fury and Not the Samuel Jackson incarnation from the new Marvel Universe movie franchise) from the Shield Helo Carrier. From this point on Nick explains the situation of what, when, and why and how you spiderman are going to help in making all things better.

You then proceed to be transported to your objectives along with 1 of 2 sidekicks at your disposal (Either Genric Hero or the Silver Sable) in locations around the world to retrieve the objectives along with saving and converting the captured foes (who are under mind control) to helping you accomplish your long term goals, you will also come across other heroes (Iron Fist, Blade), and questionable Allies (Black Cat, Lizardman, New Goblin) along the way as well. The levels start out like Street Fighter, were you walk along and fight the mysterious villians lackeys either by yourself or a sidekick (Once you gain allies it can be one of them) face the big bosses until you defeat and rescue one of the mind control villians. You then have the option of fighting them in a ""Marvel Vs. Capcom"" style versus mode which can be loads of fun. You will also have the option at the end of each level to ""upgrade"" not only your powers but that of your allies with the points you are rewarded by playing the levels.

Awesome, this items was changed from a fake item listing by ""paradise_valley_n_freedom_books"" for ""FOR XBOX SYSTEM ONLY"", but it is ""COMPLETE NINTENDO WII GUITAR HERO SET"" to a listing for a real item.

**Begin new review**

The Game: On the Wii the game plays the same as the PS2 version, but with a big difference. On the Wii the loading times (for everything) are a fraction of the time that they were on the PS2 version.

The Guitar: Works the same as you would expect a wired controller to, I tried a wireless for the PS2 and was disappointed in the number of button presses it misses, this does not happen with the Wii guitar. This controller also works with the Wii version of Beatles Rock Band.

If you are someone who does not even notice that there is a single player story to accomplish, then I don't think you will be horribly disappointed. However, if you are looking for a decent sized single player experience, you are not going to get the payoff you are looking for.

I got MoH on release day (Tuesday Oct. 12th). I popped it into my xbox at about 8:30PM and played for a couple of hours. As I write this, that was only two days ago. I played for a couple of hours yesterday morning, then again this morning for about an hour - when I finished it! I played through on the ""Hard"" setting - the most difficult option I was given. I was stunned when the game ended. I could not believe that there was literally only about 5 - 7 hours of single player story line. The bottom line is that I was left unsatisfied by the single player. What it had was good, but I just did not feel like it had enough. The challenge on the hardest setting also did not live up to my expectations. It was just too easy. Finally, the single player game felt too much as if I was on rails. I understand there is a story and they want to move you through it, but I sometimes felt I was being led by the hand a bit too much.

I then jumped on to multiplayer. I like the ability to customize your weapon. In all honesty I have only played for about an hour on multiplayer, but I liked the maps (of the two I saw). Time will tell, but clearly, this is where the payoff for the game is intended to be. One nice addition is drivable vehicles. The ""Combat Mission"" mode I played involved clearing five objectives as the aggressor or defending against that assault as the OPFOR. These played well and felt very much like a similar mode on Battlefield: Bad Company 2.  As you progress, you unlock more options for your load out. The potential variety here looks pretty amazing and I suspect that this ability to customize your in game avatar will make the game more interesting. Also in the good news column is that there is a ""Hardcore"" mode. Lets face it, there are plenty of annoying little trolls out there playing these games. I have found that heading right to the ""Hardcore"" option cuts down on those folks fast. This feature is also available for the two games I link to below. It is actually a pretty universal feature at this point.

GRAPHICS:
Nothing to write home about here. You are not going to be blown away by what you see. Frankly, the graphics look a little dated by todays standard. I noticed they used the Unreal engine and if that is what Unreal is serving up these days, it might just be time to update some code! Everything from the setting to the models of other people just don't look like what you would expect, quality wise, from a game released in 2010.

If you are just getting into first person shooters or multiplayer games of this type, there are plenty of other options that might please you more, for a lower price. Here are some suggestions:

-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Bad-Company-2/dp/B001QXNBJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Bad Company 2</a>&nbsp;- This is a good one. Huge maps, vehicles, plenty of fun! You cannot go prone in this game, which is really one of my only complaints.
-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-2/dp/B00269QLI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a>&nbsp;- Smaller maps and no vehicles - but some real fun sniping. Oh, and a silenced .50 Cal sniper rifle... so you get some fantasy gaming in there as well.

Final opinion: I think this game can appeal to just about anyone in the market for this kind of game. If you are new to the genre or a die hard FPS fan, this is a decent game to get in your hands.

I had fun in this game because it has a lot varied scenarios and missions. It jumps to different characters in a plot and even has a flash back to several years earlier (the infamous sniper level).

And the level that takes place entirely in grainy black-and-white as you fire different sized shells at ground targets I thought I was extremely fun. I forget which aircraft you're in while doing that (I'm sure I'd be corrected anyway).

The plot, as the title implies, is in modern times or ""current day"". The plot lines are similar to a season of 24 (middle eastern terrorists play with nukes along side some Russians). I loved the cinematic style and jumping between perspectives.

I haven't tried a lot of the online stuff, but gaining experience points to customize your character is a rather awesome idea.

The premise of Flash Focus is that it is a daily vision training tool for your eyes. The exercises are intended to gauge and improve 5 abilities that range from movement tracking, hand eye coordination, to peripheral vision. There are fundamental exercises that train you, and there are sports activities designed to both train and entertain you. For the first 2-3 weeks, I felt Flash Focus was kind of fun. I didn't really feel an improvement, although it said I was steadily improving. After awhile, it got very boring especially once I unlocked all of the activities. Most of the exercises do not really test your vision skills but instead evaluate your brain. The number flash, letter count, and a lot of the other exercises test your ability to memorize and regurgitate the numbers you saw. In advanced mode, the game flashes a long number for a split second and demands you to input the exact number. If you transpose 2 digits or miss one, it is considered wrong. I've gone to several optometrists and ophthalmologists in the past and they never had such testing going on. Overall, it is a fun novelty game that may or may not improve your vision with regular use. The novelty wore off quickly in my experience.

Pros: Easy way to track, manage, and improve your vision based on the game's parameters. Nifty sound effects, and some of the sports activities are entertaining.

Cons: Dated graphics, most of the exercises test your photographic memory capabilities rather than your vision. I never understood the peripheral vision test on a Nintendo DS. The real eye doctors use a much different test for peripheral vision

The game play is extremely well and the story line is good and easy to follow.  I learned about the Path of Radiance after I started playing this one.  It actually made me want to go back and play the PR.  One big minus is that although I am a huge pro-game play rather than a pro-graphics, the graphics is just way too mediocre for a 2007 Wii game.

Also, I think the game gives you way too many playable characters, especially when all the forces combine after finishing the first four chapters (waking the goddess).  I mean like the characters from the Dawn's Brigate (i.e. Ch. 1), considering their low level/stats, lack of unique personal skills and no real link to the overall storyline, I don't see any legitimate reason to play these characters after the forces combine unless the ultimate goal is to challenge your FE skills.  Even those powerful characters from the Greil's Merc whom you play 10+ episodes with in Ch. 3 (and previously in Path of Radiance), it seems that they automatically become obsolete when picking out your final crew upon entrance into the tower.  I mean c'mon, would any player resist playing the Kings/Queen from the Laguz tribe for other ordinary characters like, for example, Aran the poor soldier from Ch. 1 or even Skimitar (I know this is not the correct spelling) the lion king's heir to be?  I doubt.

Personally I just think by offering players all those iconic playerable characters towards the end of the game takes away the fun of developing your crew.  The fact that I spent so much time spreading experiences evenly to my favorite characters all seem to be a waste of effort at the end.  At the end I used maybe two characters from the Greil's Mercs and that's about it.  All others are either Laguz leaders or special characters like Queen Emelia, whom I primarily use as a front-line healer since Micaiah is just too weak against non-magical confrontations.

I thought the game was good, not great, but not completely horrible either.  I love the Hellboy movies and the comics, so it's probably a good idea to be a fan of Hellboy before considering this game.  I also love some games that are sort of mindless and don't bother with litering the game with puzzles.

The graphics are kind of bland, but at least Hellboy himself looks great, especially with his big Right Hand of Doom.  You'll visit some locations like a castle, an old creepy villiage, a Japan like forest, a lost desert, and some others.

The game itself is rather easy to play, because it's just a simple beat em up.  You just run from one area to the next, beat up all the bad guys in that area, and then move on to the next, and to the next, until finally you come to some boss that only takes a little more thought to beat than the regular baddies.  And if you get beat up too bad and take too much damage, you just avoid enemy attacks for a moment and you're health will completely regenerate, which kind of makes the game easier than most games of this type.

The sound was mostly generic, but at least they got Ron Pearlman to voice Hellboy.  I've yet to play multiplayer, so I don't know how the other movie star voice actors held up in the game.

Everyone gets disconnected from multiple games all the time. Originally, I thought people were quitting... but after getting disconnected prior to the game starting or during the game (WHILE I WAS WINNING).. I realized this was not the case.

If people quit and you're still playing, you don't get points to rank up. If you get disconnected, you are still unable to get back online and rejoin the game you were bumped from. (This would have been a nice bonus for a game that has you play on servers that bump you off-line so frequently).

There are some fun extra scenes and types of gameplay. I'll give them credit  for that. It's not just team deathmatch, deathmatch and that retarded rogue agent. I enjoy the capture the flag type game because it gives you the most points. I didn't understand it the first few times I played-- but after awhile, its easy to catch onto and learn where the pods are to get points.

I did not receive points for a few rated games. The game would end and (surprisingly) no one had quit. My XP points didn't go up-- nor did the number of games I had played.

The guns... there is no motivation online. The sawed offs do not kill instantly. You're better off going for headshots. This is kind of good I guess. No easy kills and you can dodge bullets easier. More realistic? Not so sure. I've never ran from bullets. But in regards to game play, its nice to know that you have a chance against people with higher ranks.

Hackers have already started working their magic online. I saw a T3 online with no games played. Sometimes, I swear there are people on there that you shoot who just refuse to die. It could be a hack--- or it might be the bad servers. I haven't seen enough of this to be certain.

You get no new guns when you rank up from R0 to R1. I have been told you get some new ones at R3. But you start with the M16k .. and have access to the snipers. Why do you need anything else?

If you play with the settings, the game is not ranked. This is annoying.

The combat is awful, the characters are all flat, it really doesn't matter what your character looks like or what gender he or she is. The game ignores your choices for the most part. The world is nothing but a huge wasteland. I can never find my way around.

That said, I know this game gets glowing reviews from everyone else, and that's fine. Just because I don't like it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. I hear good things. The gameplay just frustrated me to the point that I didn't want to play anymore. I love Bethesda games--Fallout: New Vegas was is one of my favorites. This one just lacked something.

Bethesda has crafted a fully realized world to explore - it's absolutely huge. They've done it to great success many times before with the Elder Scrolls series and this is a perfect continuation. Being that it is modeled after the Elder Scrolls games, especially Oblivion, I'd like to advise the FPS fans out there that this is a game for RPG players. It's similar to Mass Effect in that it involves guns and lasers, etc. but the weapons don't handle the way they would in an FPS. If you're looking to be dropped down in a level and then go through it shooting up monsters, you'll be disappointed. In this game, you'll be talking and thinking as much as you'll be fighting. Combat is an important element of the game but it's not mindless running and gunning. In my opinion, the combat system is really great - especially the VATS interface that lets you stop time and target specific enemies and body parts (this is really a system Bethesda needs to implement in the next Elder Scrolls game). Unlike Oblivion, there isn't a ton of story. Although there are plenty of quests and things to do apart from the main story, it's nowhere near the size and granduer or Oblivion, which has so much side story that you can get a complete gaming experience and never complete any part of the main quest. I think that Fallout 3 operates on the less is more principle when it comes to quests - there's a lot to do but not so much that you'll feel overwhelmed. All in all, I recommend this game for fans of Oblivion and other entries in the Elder Scrolls series, as well as to fans of large, immersive RPGs.

You will find yourself dying HUNDREDS of times which will really destroy your experience either from traps or due to random instant kills that just randomly happen and to this very day still has yet to be patched. All in all... I honestly was pretty disappointed with the game mainly because of how poorly the shooting mechanics were designed as well as how ridiculous some of the later enemy types are and how hard the game was to play even on the easiest difficulty. And the later platforming will REALLY have you dying and raging a lot as well. In all honesty you might have more fun watching someone play this game rather than playing it yourself due to how faulty the gameplay in this game truly is. All in all it has a good story but... Terrible gameplay. I do not recommend buying this game but instead watching someone play it on YouTube and watching them suffer so that you don't have to. All in all this game gets an average score just because of how good the story was. If not for that...

3,True,"05 3, 2010",A1EVL7H98J19LD,B000UW1YBW,Joey Joe Joe Jr S.,"Folklore for the ps3 is a ACTION game with very minor rpg elements thrown in. Simply put the action is similar to that of the Kingdom Hearts series, you use a variety of combos to take out your foes. There is no traditional jrpg menu driven combat system in this game. Hence an action/hack n slash title. The reason why this game leans towards rpg is because you can select the types of attacks that you have on hand to use from a variety of attacks that you accumulate throughout the game. Its strong points are the very well executed combat system and the top notch design/graphics/visuals. Where the game falls short is the lack of rpg elements, and a lackluster story. I will elaborate in detail in the following paragraphs.

What is interesting about the combat system is the distinct use of the enemies you defeat. For example the first time you take down the ""horned bull"" and absorb its ""spirit"" you can then attack using this spirit and the ""horned bull"" is visually represented during your attack a few feet in front of your character, visually this is very neat. Furthermore linking together combos from various spirits makes for some distinct gameplay that in my opinion far surpasses the extremely repetitive nature of combat found in games like Kingdom Hearts. There is allot of room for creativity in how and when you combine your attacks/spirits. The combat is very fun and beautifully executed visually, if you are a fan of fantasy styled visuals you will not be disappointed.

Which leads me to what strikes me most about this game, the over all art design and wonderful use of color. The many environments, and various foes look just fantastic. Design wise I would describe the look and feel of this game as Hansel and Gretel meets Final Fantasy meets Wizard of Oz. Very distinct traditional story book vibe meets modern fantasy feel which had me deeply absorbed for the first 5 hours or so simply due to the solid combat and the distinctly gorgeous visuals. Though like most things beautiful that lack ""heart"", over time the flaws begin to outweigh the visual beauty.

When I said this game is NOT an rpg that is because it isn't in the traditional sense. Your character is in one very small town throughout the game and you interact with a very limited number of characters that you must interact with to unlock the next action driven playable area. There is no open world, various towns, player defined pacing of game play.  Which is not a big deal to me, just do not go in with the expectation of jrpg styled exploration. This game is on rails.

And the story. In my opinion the story was convoluted, abstract and bland. There are really no memorable characters in the game. And by around hour 12 I had lost all interest in the unfolding ""mystery"", I simply didn't care about the story or characters.

That about sums it up Folklore. If you are looking for a different action title to mix into your gaming routine, then I say go for it, the combat is fun and distinct. Again the game looks just great, I am a fan of the art design and the graphics. On the negative side the game itself does not let you ""explore"", and the story was very hard to follow and boring. The characters are far from memorable and are all image and no heart. I really wanted to love this game as it made such a strong impact at the outset, though over time I just found myself not wanting to ""hack it out"" to learn more about a story/characters that I simply did not understand/care about. Three star game worth about $15-$20.",PS3 Folklore Review,1272844800,17,,
5,True,"08 12, 2012",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000UW21A0,Lisa Shea,"We adore the Drake series of video games. After having played the series quite a bit, we decided to go back and play the original to see how it's held up.

It's intriguing to wonder if back in 2009 the creators of the original Drake's game realized that they would have such a popular series on their hands. It's tempting to think that they did. The characters, right from the beginning, grab at you. Drake is like a young Indiana Jones. Sully is like Sam on Burn Notice - older, wiser, a great back-up. Then there's Elena who has got intelligence and spunk.

The movie mixes in cut-scenes and action, with jungles, puzzles, action sequences and exploration. The humor is laugh out loud funny.

Certainly it's easy to say that game makers have progressed since this came out. They have improved how they handle graphics, movement, and enemies. But the basics are all solid here. A variety of weapons, intriguing characters to interact with, collectibles to find, and a fun storyline. You actually grow to care for these characters, with their quirks and foibles. Which is great, of course, since you get more stories in the future to continue the path with them and learn how their lives progress.

If you somehow played the games out of order I highly recommend that you go back and play this first one to see where it all began. If somehow you haven't seen the series at all, then absolutely I recommend you start here. Get to know how it all began with Drake, Sully, and Elena. And know that once you begin to form that relationship with them, you're in for a treat, because the subsequent games are quite fun as well.

Are there any down sides here? If you hate action-adventure style games where you're jumping over platforms and wall-climbing through dense jungles, then you probably won't like this. It is like Indiana Jones come to life. This isn't a farmville game or a tetris style puzzle. It does involve three-dimensional thinking and accurate button pushing.

But if you're a fan of this style of action game, I highly recommend it.

After the first hour or so, however, the story became as basic as an old school Mario story with rescuing the damsel in distress and all. Obviously the central point of the story is finding El Dorado, but soon this game became a pointless run and gun exercise.

First Impressions:  The title screen is lovely and it led to an anticipation of whats to come.  Turning it on however, I was greeted by blocky controls.  At first I thought I had freedom to move about the island but turned out I was wrong, everything is set on paths.  Your character kind of quirks and jerks around the island stumbling into unmoveable bushs with all his stiffness.  Follow this up with 'what just happened' cut scenes and dabble on a self-centering bad camera angle and you have your opener of sorts.  Jungles have never been accurately reproduced in games, I was hoping this would be an exception.

Play it Again Sammy:  The game blocks it up like episodes of the show, think Matrix: the Game, only with intros and logos.  I didn't like the 'previously on Lost' intro showing me what I played just seconds earlier but this works well when you go back to earlier episodes or pick it back up after taking a break.  They could have canned the intro while you were playing and it would have been an improvement.  Adding the Lost Logo at the mystery point near the beginning and the mystery at closing was a very nice touch but in some instances, out of place.  While your running around you pick up loose items and put them in your backpack.  You trade these for items you need, torches, oil, handguns.  Collect everything you find and you won't have any issues with currency.  Eventually this feels like your only collecting fuses and beer.  You become the red neck Thomas Edison of the island with a backpack full of brewskies and the knowledge of electricity.

Getting Lost in It:  There I am on the beach, this story doesn't follow between 2 and 3, it starts at the beginning.  The wreckage scene was not accurately shown, bummer.  Tech heads would point out the left wing was gone all together and the still running engine was originally mounted next to the fusalage not out in the open say between the blown engine and the fusalage.  Here is where the game play gets really odd.  Your first mission is to divert the fuel flow to prevent an explosion.  How?  Your best guess and stumbling around looking for something that glimmers that you can click on.  Oh, its one of those games!  You simply walk around and look for something to get shiny.  Hmmm.  From there on out its being an errand boy.  Find your luggage.  Another walk around, this time with dummy objects to slow your progress.

Let The Exploration Begin:  ""Find your camera""...okay now you get to journey off the beach and thank the light, not a moment too soon.  Here is where you find another idea they came up with for you to do.  Its 'find your waypoints' time in the jungle.  Find your waypoint and it will point you to the next waypoint 30 feet away.  Some waypoints are hidden, others can be skipped.  All together its a romp in the park.  Then you find the front nose of the plane.  Again, not accurate at all with the film, they put it hanging over a cliff.  Why?  On board the plane is another puzzle to divert power to the electronically locked compartment.  Sayid would be proud.  Even after solving the puzzle you can 'steal' the fuses for later use, brillant.

Do The Hokey, Pokey:  This is pretty much the giest of the game.  Get your mission,  get through the ever increasing difficulty of the jungle (way points turn into compass points you have to cross reference, the jungle has Ben's guys shooting at you and finally you have to make your way past a fast pathing Black Smoke...while walking...with Black Rock Dynomite), find your target and return, Rinse Repeat.

Mini Games?  There is two instances of a 'run for your life' part thats interesting even with the blockly controls and bad camera angle.  The two cave journey parts are interesting as long as you think ahead...Think fumbling around in Shadowgate back in the day with no torches.  There is a Swan Station part that was very interesting with you playing with the computer doing things that Locke couldn't find that lends itself to an all inclusive venture of the station and here they really shined with accuracy, my hats off for this part and the equally thrilling Flame Station part.

ShutterBug:  There is parts in the game where your clued in on taking a picture.  Somethings are hidden and you must find the special path to find these things but there is usually some risk involved.  Getting the snapshot is more thrilling then the Game concept art the game rewards you with back at the main menu.  However, getting the right shot can be obnoxiously hard at times.  I took a picture of a laptop a dozen times from different angles before it accepted the 'win'.  Even my wife mentioned something was off with that.  They could have really done better with the camera's rewards or even had hidden things for taking scenic shots ala Metal Gear Solid.  Still a lot of the hidden item shots is cheeky fun to do.

New stuff!  I'm not going to divulge into any of the new things that your adventure on the island will uncover.  Up to now its been stuff we all know.  There is one instance at the Flame where you go 'oh thats why that happened'.  You also eventually get to see more of the Hydra and the Black Rock, no big deal but fun nonetheless.  There is finally a 'gap filler' that is presented.  This is a nice albiet short lived portion that had me screaming for my wife to check out.  Its a wonderful present in the middle of it all making the rental much worth the money.  Another piece of the puzzle and something I can finally breathe a sigh of relief on.  You'll have to rent it to find out for yourself.  Snicker!

Mi Capitane!  The main characters presented for you to talk to in your flight.  The talking sessions remind me of the blocky Knights of the Old Republic chat scenes, however, your questions have little bearing of consequences.  Ask away!  The voice acting is superb and most of the characters are believeable, some sound like they have a cold.  All together it had my wife fooled into thinking they were the real deal.  Mums the word!  The character models are excellent but thier motions are very robotic.  Its thier hands, they don't move thier hands.  Thier face is expressionable and extremely close to the actor they portray but they end up looking like a talking head on a manniquine.

The Hills are Alive!  The visuals, even with the exception of inaccuracies of special locales are stunningly beautiful.  They put a lot of heart into how it looked.  Even the jungle with its waypoint gimmick is something to behold.  Sometimes I want to just look at what they done and all the hard work they put into it but they don't lend themselves to giving you said time because of dangers.  Its not 'the' island, it 'an' island.  The layout for the most part is great and leads itself to adventuring.  Hi-res rocks the world!

It All Comes Out in the Wash:  I wrapped this rental up in 8 hours.  It has very little replay value which is a loss in my mind from all the work they put into it.  I would only go back to find the picture opportunities I missed and the few hidden locations I know are still out there.  Lost: Via Domus did not leave a bad taste in my mouth but its shortness was dissappointing.

I purchased this well after all the hoopla had gone out. I think that this Wii peripheral can enhance your gaming experience if you go into it with not too many expectation.
One of the problems, which others here have already mentioned, is that the trigger does not have any spring support. As a result, the trigger can sometimes get stuck. When I first started using the Zapper I found myself frustrated because the trigger would not return to position resulting in me fumbling with it until it got back into position. The result is that I missed quite a few shots. The solution to this is to slow down your shooting and to get into a rhythm in which you time your shots. The trigger cannot simulate rapid fire weapons such as those in Call of Duty. Also, if you find the trigger not responding well despite the slower shooting, try removing the Wii remote and re-seating it in the barrel.
Another problem which I found while using this Zapper is that the cross-hairs tend to fly around the screen. It is not steady and tends to move up, down, left or right and float on you. If you go into it not expecting a steady cross-hair, you might be okay with this. Some will find this frustrating and want to go back to the game pad immediately. But if you practice, you may get better at it.
Another thing I experienced while using the Zapper is that due to the design or ergonomics, my upper arms began to feel fatigued pretty fast. I lift weights and work out so I can only imagine what a person who does not work out must experience after a short time with using this peripheral. You can rest your arm on an arm rest and that may help. But be prepared for Zapper fatigue.
Some complained that assembling the Zapper is quite tiresome. I found it to be not too bad. You have to unlatch the holder on the butt of the weapon and remove the cover on the bottom in order to install the Wii nunchuk. That is the extent of the hassle. Installing the Wii remote itself is very easy. You just snap it on while holding down the button on Zapper. I don't think that the parts will break on the Zapper if you simply do what you are supposed to.  The plastic material on the Zapper is actually decent. It is not exactly cheap plastic material. It lies somewhere between cheap plastic and quality heavy duty plastic.
I have the Sony Move Rifle and I can compare it with the Zapper. I can say that the Move has a much better trigger due to a spring-like mechanism. Also, the cross-hair does not float like with the Zapper. But then the floating is not to be blamed on the Zapper itself but on the Wii hardware and software.
For those of you thinking about getting this device, be prepared to find out that the relatively few games that support it are few. And be ready to spend extra as the games are even harder to find. You see, game developers did not get into this device. The only ones available for this device are rail shooters such as Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, House of the Dead and a few obscure titles. You can count them on your fingers of both hands. Not many. And if you are thinking of using it on first person shooters that are not listed as compatible titles, you will find out the hard way that the controls do not lend themselves well for such titles due to the fact that the controls will be at the top of the gun barrel away from your trigger finger.
If you are planning to get the games mentioned above, you may want to invest in the Zapper as it does give you the feel of aiming a gun at your target. Nothing can compare to using a barrel to simulate a shooting experience.
As for why the company decided to put the trigger on the front can be easily surmised by looking at the limitations of the Wii remote itself. If they had placed it towards the rear, there would be no room for the Wii nunchuk. Place towards the rear and the nunchuk would have to be at the front. Personally I would have designed the Zapper much differently. It would have moved the trigger more to the rear and still incorporate the nunchuk for its analog stick. If Nintendo would like to know how it can be accomplished, they can contact me and I would be willing to help them develop the peripheral for their current and future consoles.
If you are not planning to get the games I mentioned, you don't need this peripheral at all.
Pros:
1. Makes it feel like you are shooting with a gun.
2. Makes aiming a little easier.
Cons:
1. Trigger sticking.
2. Hassle assembling.
3. Floating cross-hair (due to Wii hardware and software)
4. Arm fatigue.

~The narrative enhances game play. Doesn't get in the way. Doesn't give you the impression the designer thought they were making an interactive movie. Doesn't (mostly) embarrass you with terrible dialog and wooden voice acting. More recent games tend to do all of these things.

~The game play is challenging. There are some corridors, entrances, scenarios that demand a single solution but there are also many large, open arenas that tempt you to come back over and over again to try a fresh tactical approach.

~Friendly deployable AI. These guys know their stuff and you can tell them to sit on their hands if they're getting in the way, which they rarely do, or concentrate them where they're useful.

~Cooperative play is a blast. If I were the sociable type I'd be at a ball game so it's worth lots of points that the campaign is as good as it is, but I do have a few pew-pew pals and the game is great fun with living wing-persons.

~Outside of the campaign, the Terrorist Hunt scenarios are enormously challenging and worth many curse-filled hours of single or coop play.

But I would say, if you like the computer version stick to that, if you're looking for something a little different, read on.

To answer another reviewers question, ""Why was this game made?""

As someone who always found Civilization games extremely massive, confusing, time-consuming, difficult to navigate, and impossible to grasp completely - THIS IS OUR SALVATION!!!!  All the fun of the Civilization franchise in a simple, intuitive, easy to learn, addictive, and yet still complex console game.  The graphics are beautiful (in the civilization's own cartoony way), the game has tons of replay-ability, and the setup/interface is so well designed that I actually quickly learned about elements of the game that I never even realized were a part of the old pc versions.

In my opinion... it's the way the Civilization games should have been designed since the very beginning.

4,False,"01 11, 2013",A3C9B3PZL9628F,B000WMEEC6,Amazonian,"Civilization Revolution was what finally convinced me to buy a DS.  Nintendo already had a better reputation for strategy games than the other portable of the era, and this title clinched the advantage.

Though accelerated (a couple hours per game instead of 40 hours) and simplified (less micromanagement), Civ Rev still feels rich and enjoyable.  There's still plenty of room to plot a variety of paths to victory and pursue them in any number of ways.  It's a smaller sandbox than desktop Civilization/Alpha Centauri, but you can do a lot inside of it.  You can focus on defense, hunker down with great people and block your opponents victory paths with espionage.  You can dominate the world with tanks, artillery and even nuke your enemies.  There are fantastic exploration bonuses that encourage you to explore each new world as early as possible.

I've read the difficulty varies from port to port, for example, the iOS version is less difficult.  On the DS version, the AI actually cheats in Deity difficulty mode, big time, and that's a good thing.  I'd much rather have a cheating AI that can actually challenge me than no challenge at all.  One of the clues that it cheats is if you leave an enemy galley from the earliest era alone, it will continue unloading units of increasing tech until the end of the game without moving to reload.  It's first unit will be a warrior and its last will be artillery.  There are also instances in which civs which don't have the special projects (because you or another civ does have them)or other means to achieve rapid economic, scientific or cultural advancement will (apparently) get extra multipliers towards one of those ends.  This is a far more effective cheat for the AI than the bottomless galleys.  You have to really scramble to prevent these surprise bonuses from winning a quick victory.  Even once you're really good at the game, this mechanism can keep things interesting.

The cartoony look works really well. The other Civs you can encounter are often times pretty funny. The only things I have against it are you can't play against your friends one-on-one (there always has to be a total of six Civs), there's really not that good of a diplomacy option, and you can't play someone else at all on the same console.

comparisons to Fallout 3 are inevitable given the RPG/FPS fusion in a post apocalyptic setting, but both excel in their own areas. where fallout delivers a deep RPG experience in a massive, fully explorable wasteland with some questionable gunplay - Borderlands is more shooter focused, with 4 player co op and more polish on the FPS gamplay with mild character progression/exploration. not to mention hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of guns for your arsenal. everything from damage level/rate of fire/recoil/clip size/reload speed to elemental add-ons including fire/explosive/acid/electricity/ect varies between guns. you're almost constantly finding new gear thanks to the revolutionary random content generation system based on your level.

when starting a new game you must choose 1 of 4 characters. a fast, stealthy female character - the extremely accurate sniper (deadly at long range) - the well rounded soldier character - and the tank, a beast in almost any combat situation. each character has their own advantages in battle, and a unique special attack. specials vary between a shielded turret, invisibility, an attack hawk, and berserk mode. the unique feeling of each character adds tons of replay value to an already lengthy game.

the campaign plays out similar to an open world rpg, tavelling from place to place, picking up new quests and loot along the way.

the cell shading graphics offer a unique flare not often seen in games, especially shooters. it may not have the detail of a game like Gears of War, but its got its own unigue style that looks great considering the size of the game and th amount of content.

vehicle controls are very similar to those of halo 3, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your taste.

dont get me wrong, i still hold Fallout as the best game of 2008, but if you liked the ideas behind Fallout 3 and were pushed away by the questionable gunplay or the depth of RPG character progression, Borderlands may just be the game for you. its a more accessable, more polished rethinking of the RPG/FPS fusion.

The single player is fairly lengthy, with a lot of fun achievements, and a replayability of at least 2 runs through the campaign, maybe three. (I'm on my second playthrough, and might do one more) By far, the biggest problem in singleplayer is the AI. The enemy ALWAYS knows where you are. It doesn't really make the game terribly difficult, it just makes it a bit boring. There's no way to be sneaky, you can't snipe, you just have to run in to the battle every time. It doesn't pay to hide and fire from far away. Once you fire your first shot, every enemy within range instantly knows where you are and begins lobbing rather large pieces of metal at your skull. Feels fake. Your AI is also useless, but I guess that's normal...

The multiplayer is very fun too, although grossly imbalanced, not in kits, but in the side you play. If you play Defense, 80%+ of the time you will win, and if you play offense, >20% of the time will you be victorious. This isn't a deal breaker, and it it doesn't make the game miserable, but it's a bit frustrating when your team is obviously better than the opposing team, but try as you might, you can't destroy all the enemy objectives. This is a minor issue that will be fixed soon in a patch however. The bigger issue is that vehicles are a bit too tough/powerful. They're quite difficult to kill, and can be a bit irratating when they spawn camp. Once again, however, it's not a dealbreaker. Hopefully DICE will include a no-vehicle mode later on. *PLEASE PLEASE, DICE!!*

THE GOOD :
This game is first and foremost very `effective'. Effective in the sense that it's so creepy & eerie in its' atmospherics it becomes unsettling the longer you play it (especially late at night!). So much so that (as I saw someone elsewhere say) ""it makes the mundane task of opening a door a near ordeal"". And that it does. Every door you open, every corner you turn, every room you enter causes you to mentally bolster yourself for what may or may not be coming at you. And sometimes it's as predictable as you'd expect and other times it's not at all. That's what helps make it so effective. Add to the fold the low lighting, constant background sounds of creaking, moaning, aliens slinking about, whispers and other asundry noises not of this world (kudos to the games very creepy version of 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' !), and you have quite possibly one of the most atmospheric games created. Visually speaking, the vistas of space, planets, the character you control and much of the scenery you walk through is spectacular and breathtaking. Ironically, the aliens you fight are not (even in a gruesome way) but we'll get to that in a moment..... Another thing I liked about DEAD SPACE was the way in which the gameplay is varied. Mainly this is a FPS-type 3rd person game, but there are moments when you control massive ship-mounted cannons, run to dodge asteroids, perform zero-G jumps and even get to play Basketball in zero-G! Well done in terms of breaking up the monotony of  a constant FPS-type game. Additionally, the weapons are a lot of fun (especially when they've been upgraded and do more damage) too. But getting back to the `effective' factor of this game, it will make you consider carefully your ammo and spending habits, as you may or may not always have enough of what you need to get the job done. Additionally, the number of items your suit will allow you to carry and the weapons in your arsenal will force you to make solid battle strategies to deal with the situations at hand.

THE BAD :
As I mentioned previously (and this is a relatively minor thing) the aliens in the game, while gruesome and disturbing in appearance enough, don't look as well rendered as the rest of the game. Especially up close, and believe me, they WILL get up close on you! Maybe it's just me, but they felt a bit more choppy and not as smooth in movement as the rest of the game was, but hey, like I said, it's a relatively minor gripe. And maybe they were supposed to be that way - they're aliens, right? All in all, they looked more like PS2 quality renderings than PS3....  The only one real, significant, major complaint I had with this game was, it's WAY too difficult in some spots. And I only played it on `normal' setting as I'm not into making things easier or harder on myself. I've seen others comment on their frustrations with the asteroid shooting sequence, but for me that wasn't that difficult to get by with some practice. What WAS difficult were a few spots in the game where you're trapped in a room with BOATLOADS of aliens, limited ammo and no way out until almost all are dead. Seriously, it took over a week to get by some of these spots and I was about ready to give up on the game altogether, even w/ help from the Internet. But, like anything, `practice makes perfect' I guess, or I just got a lucky break. But be forewarned - this is definitely a frustratingly difficult game at times.

OVERALL :
An at times, VERY difficult game, that is one of the most atmospheric, creepy and well-done I've seen. Great visuals, superb sound effects and varied gameplay make this a good if not great game to play. Definitely recommended for fans of this genre and those who just want to try something a little different.

UPON FURTHER REVIEW:
Since DEAD SPACE 2 is coming out at the beginning of 2011, I decided to go back and not only re-familiarize myself with the storyline, but also to clean up the trophies on this game and get the Platinum trophy. I'm glad I did, as I came to realize that this game was not as difficult as I had first thought, though there were still a few areas that caused me some grief, as they had before. None the less I enjoyed this game much, much more on successive playthroughs (I have now played it a full 3.5 times through) and still found it to be creepy, unsettling, disturbing and jarring even after knowing what was going to pop out at me and when. Definitely a sign of an effective and well-done game. All in all, this is really a fantastic game and I'm glad I went back and played this again. It gave me a much deeper appreciation for it.",DEAD SPACE Left Me Torn.....,1268006400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

To begin with, let me admit I am a big FPS fan especially when a sandbox design is involved, and I still consider the original Far Cry to be the best game ever made (I have played it through many times). Having played this through twice, the second time on ""hardcore"" and focusing on the side missions, I count this as second in line, with Crysis in third place.

The environment is drop dead stunning, and increasingly awesome as you wander all over the place and take in the almost endless diverse details. (Reviewers talk about Fallout 3 as realistic - not even close to this). I am only disappointed that you are often prevented from climbing to a position of advantage in places where you should be able to. In the original Far Cry I delighted in finding a ""seam"" where I could very slowly climb to a cliff top and fire down on the unsuspecting mercs. Not in this game, unfortunately, but there are still many, many approaches to dealing with a mission that make it continually interesting.

Yes, the main story is weak and the re-spawning and repetition can be annoying. That's why, in my second time around, I stayed away from the main plot as much as allowed, and simply revelled in the side plots, while getting access to even the most difficult diamonds, and trying different approaches to the most difficult missions (for example, can you pull off an assassination with just one silent shot and get out with no one the wiser).

I also tried my hand at the level designer they include. I replicated a level from Far Cry, just for kicks, with pretty good results. Very powerful and relatively easy to use. I only wish they provided a way for you to place scripted NPCs (I'm not much of a multiplayer fan, which is what this is really for - hence no NPCs).

In any case, I highly recommend this game despite its flaws.",A very good (but not excellent) follow on to the original Far Cry,1231200000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Bad: RTS elements are out of place, a tad short, repetitive side missions, just feels like something's missing

Ahh good ol' metal. That is exactly what you'll say when playing Brutal Legend thanks to Tim Schafer's genius imagination, and Jack Black's great voice acting. Brutal Legend isn't exactly revolutionary, but it does have some ideas that are interesting.

When it comes to the story this is one of Brutal Legend's strong points. You play as Eddie Riggs who is a roadie and gets sent to another world, and that world is full of metal. Eddie runs into many characters, but his main goal is to find out why he is there and defeat the evil lord Diviculus.

The game starts out strong and shows you the ropes of combat and your Deuce. Yes the vehicle you drive around in the big open world. Combat consists of a strong attack and a normal attack followed by your axe. Your axe can shoot lightning upon foes or burn then. Along with this you can smash down on the ground to send foes flying. There are some upgrades you can get that will extend combos and lead into using your axe, but combat is pretty shallow. Nothing ever really evolves, and it can even be a bit sluggish at times and a tad unresponsive. Upgrading the pain and strings on your guitar can make certain attacks more powerful. Not only can you upgrade your axe, but the Deuce as well (more on that later).

While you may think combat sounds shallow you can also use ""super powers"" which are little riff mini-games that can do certain things. The main ones you will use will be the one to summon your Deuce anywhere. Another is the face melter which is followed by a great camera cut of melting faces! There is even one to rally your troops, block your enemies from creating more troops and so on.

Finding the relics for these powers is a huge pain since the world is so big and finding these rare relics can be tough, but wait a second I'll get back to the open world later.

First let's finish combat. Yes you can upgrade your vehicle with weapons to help shoot down foes and even get a secondary weapon such as mines or flame throwers. The main focus of the game is RTS...wait...what? RTS? You're kidding me right? I thought this was a God of War type game...I'm very sorry, but this is true and while it works it is the game's biggest let down. I too thought this game was all action adventure until I got hit with a tutorial on how to do this. Well to make things simple all your basic RTS elements are here: Creating troops, upgrading your ""base"" to create stronger troops, and collecting ""resources"" to fund all this. With a unique take on RTS you have to build ""merch booths"" on green holes in the ground to create fans which in turn let you create troops. Upgrading your base, up to two times, lets you create greater troops like roadies, bouncers, and even fire barons. You have basic troops (head bangers) and chicks that shoot fire out of their guitars. There are a lot of units, and while you command them around the map via a light you can tell them to hold, attack, go to, or follow you. Eddie gets to fly around the map and when you need to aid your troops you can use any of your ""special attacks"". If you Eddie dies he respawns at his stage thanks to his fans.

Now while all this sounds simple it really is TOO simple and could have been cut from the game. There are ""in between"" levels that have you fetching these troops, or going from A-B and I really liked those missions better. The RTS just took too long and felt out of place in an action adventure type game. I was also disappointed to see only two boss fights which were at the beginning and end, thus the developers using side missions as fillers in between story missions. These side missions are interesting at first, but become extremely repetitive since there isn't much of a variety.

Side missions vary from helping the Ironheade (yes with an E so people know we're serious...) members ambush an enemy convoy all the way to racing. Some other missions consist of using your vehicle to fight off convoys and the rare unique side mission. There is even a hunting record breaker, but this allows you to send that creature into battle to help you fight. Of course you get something for completing these missions and that is fire tributes. Think of these as currency to buy stuff at the store.

My favorite part about the whole game is actually the art style. Everything from the trees to the rocks to the animals is influenced by metal from the 70's ad 80's and Double Fine captured the feeling perfectly. The graphics are amazing and the voice acting is top notch, but you can't help but notice the attention to detail in everything. Not only is the art style unique, but the execution as well such as the dry ice mines, and the great wall which is made of amps that are so powerful they can kill you. Everything is pure metal and so is the great 40+ song soundtrack.

Damn you Tim Schafer. You've been gifted with the ability to turn the most outlandishly wacky ideas (and not to mention potentially unmarketable) into some of the most funny and original games ever created. This makes you a godsend since most games these days are neither original nor funny (even when they try their hardest - I'm looking at you Halo and Grand Theft Auto clones). While I speak from a lesser-exposed point of view (I haven't yet had the pleasure of playing The Secret Of Monkey Island or Grim Fandango), I have played Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psychonauts/dp/B0007PIEB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psychonauts</a>&nbsp;and I know a special game when I see it. While Full Throttle and Day of the Tentacle were fun, Psychonauts is Schafer's first grand work, and one of the best games of the sixth generation. Psychonauts was full of all kinds of wacky characters, ber-creative levels, subtle dark humor, innovative gameplay mechanics, responsive controls, and mature themes under all those bright colors (the Memory Reels are quite tragic and sad, mirroring the losses and hardships we've all faced). I consider Psychonauts to be one of the finest games ever made, and I guarantee that no matter what type of gamer you are, there's something for you in Psychonauts. And y'know what? This was Schafer's first game to be released on a console. Talk about starting with a bang! But with the video game market shunning innovation and constantly reproducing the same drivel over and over (I can't wait for another futuristic first person shooter that blatantly rips off Halo or Madden: The Same Game As Last Year), would Schafer be able to continue his tradition of creating something original in a sea of unoriginality?

Thankfully yes! Enter Brtal Legend, a game about heavy metal, made by a metalhead, for metalheads. While this will most likely turn off some people, it is insanely fun for me and will be for anyone who gets the slightest enjoyment out of listening to heavy metal. Pretty much everything about the game is great, save for a few minor things.  The level design, characters, controls, gameplay, and especially, the soundtrack are all top-notch.

On the surface, the game is a basic hack-n-slash with free roam that turns onto a real time strategy (RTS) game at certain points. The hack-n-slash part is fun; you have an upgradeable battle axe and guitar that serve as your weapons, as well as a customizable hot rod, dubbed ""The Deuce"", armed with weapons and nitro. You can also perform solos with the guitar, similar to playing the the ocarina in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time/dp/B0009Y808Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>. They range from summoning The Deuce, playing a literally face-melting solo against enemies, and my personal favorite, calling in an air strike from a giant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zeppelin/dp/B000002J03/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zeppelin</a>. While I don't care for RTS's, with the exception of Command & Conquer, it works here and is integrated nicely in the heavy metal universe. Instead of using gold or harvesting some other resource for funds to buy and build units, your ""currency"" is fans. You construct ""merch booths"" that spawn fans, which allows you to create new units for your army. The more merch booths you construct, the more fans you're allowed. Your home base is a stage which you must protect. You have all the usual units, but with a wonderful heavy metal spin: infantry are headbangers, ranged weapons are groupies with guns, tanks are skull covered ballistas, stealth guys are roadies carrying speakers, etc. The imagination and design of these things is amazing and heartfelt, showing Schafer and the design team really have a love for the source material. That being said, the RTS element is my least favorite part of the game. While the victory is indeed ""brtal"" when you win, the controls are a bit lacking in this regard. Issuing attack/defend commands can be a pain, and controlling an individual unit is nearly impossible. The cool part is that you can jump right into the battle and start dealing out death personally along side your troops.

The strategy element isn't really there, but that's OK for me. My ""strategy"" was to spawn as many units as possible, while upgrading my stage to produce more powerful units, and go gung-ho and destroy everything. This worked well until I realized you could spawn The Deuce and use it IN battle. This made things ridiculously fun and much easier since I upgraded it to maximum kickass-ness with missile launchers, flame jets, and one heck of a battering ram. I was shooting the bad guys, setting them on fire and running them over while simultaneously spawning more and more troops to help me kick butt.

The other missions are standard (and a tad repetitive) as far as most games go: recruit these people for your army, escort your caravan to the next area, stage battle, repeat. This isn't really a complaint because the repeated missions are always done in new and beautifully designed areas, so it still manages to stay somewhat fresh. There are side missions to earn you ""fire tributes"", which serve as the game's currency and let you upgrade your inventory. The game also has tons of things to unlock, collect and discover. I get an immense satisfaction from collecting stuff, so this made the game even more fun for me. Brtal Legend has upgrades, concept art, new solos, and new songs you can unlock by finding certain things. You can also free ""bound serpents"" to give you health and armor upgrades and find legends that tell the history of the metal land. And the game looks absolutely stunning. The entire game world is designed in the style of heavy metal album covers, conveying epicness in every sense of the word. Google Frank Frazetta and Boris Vallejo to get a sense of the game's style.

The soundtrack is the best part of the game. A good deal of my time was just spent driving around listening to The Deuce's radio, dubbed ""The Mouth Of Metal"". All different genres of metal are present here in the game's 108 songs, including the originators of heavy metal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Sabbath/dp/B00006LHW1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Sabbath</a>, the thrash metal of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Motrhead/dp/B0000AM77D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Motrhead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Megadeth/dp/B000VKW7AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Megadeth</a>, the 80's hair/glam metal of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mtley-Cre/dp/B00070QL7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mtley Cre</a>, the modern power metal of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DragonForce/dp/B000FKO5DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DragonForce</a>, and tons of tracks by lesser known but utterly awesome artists (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brocas-Helm/dp/B000CSULVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brocas Helm</a>, Omen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riot/dp/B00000HZHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riot</a>, etc.) that perfectly compliment the game. I think this is why I found the game to be so damn good compared to other reviewers because I truly love music, especially heavy metal, and because of this I was able to have more fun with the game than the average ""radio listener"". The original score by Tim Schafer's long time collaborator Peter McConnell is also superbly done.

And mark my words: Brtal Legend will suffer ""Psychonauts Syndrome"", receiving a decent critical reception but not becoming highly regarded until later.

So the bottom line? Brtal Legend rocks! While it's not without its flaws, it is lovingly crafted by true fans of metal and will be much more enjoyable to those that like metal.

Also, the lights lose about half of their brightness when viewed from an angle, so unless the keyboard is directly under your eyes, the blue keys look blurry, and not like the picture. The keyboard is also all black when the power is off, or the lights are turned off, so you need to keep the lights on all the time, unless you have every key memorized, thats a personal thing, but worth mentioning.

4,False,"10 3, 2011",A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B000Z9A95M,Armando N. Roman,"For the last couple of months, I've been playing Okami with my daughter, little by little until we finally completed it just a few hours ago. She's only 4, but was drawn into the world and story right from the beginning. Not a day's went by where some kind kind of reference to the game wasn't made, and she's even added pictures to her coloring books that feature dogs just so they match scenes in the game. My point in saying all of this is that even though this is a story-driven game, it's easy to see that this game can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and this is the kind of game I would've adored when I was younger too. While I feel bad for not giving Okami a shot when I had a ps2, I'm glad it was one of the first games I bought when I purchased a Wii early this year.

Okami's story is a long one, but the main point to it is that you play as the sun god Amaterasu, a white wolf who needs to purify Japan from many curses and monsters that have started to take over. You were once much stronger- a white wolf named Shiranui, but died in a battle with a powerful 8 headed dragon named Orochi. Since you've been reincarnated, you need to restore your powers which consist of 13 magical brush techniques from the other gods. Amaterasu has a brush at her disposal that controls certain elements and can do other things like sprout trees, slow time, walk up walls and more. Along with her is the wandering artist Issun, who wants to be in on the brush techniques too. He serves as Amaterasu's speaker (think of him as a much less annoying version of Navi from Ocarina of Time) and is helpful in many situations as well. At first the main objective is to get the brush techniques and defeat Orochi, but things get even more serious later on.

When it comes down to it, Okami is a spruced up version of any Zelda game. It has the same tone as your standard Zelda game- lighthearted but it can be dark when it needs to be. The big difference for me is that Okami is much more interesting. We actually learn the backstory to characters and plot points instead of it just being another 'oh, this is the bad guy, can you go stop him and get the same weapons in the same temples that you always do? Thanks!'. I was genuinely interested in the story here, and learning more about all the characters. What exactly is the deal with Waka and why is he following Amaterasu? Is Susano really the hero that he tries to convince everyone he is? Will Issun ever get anywhere with that 'busty babe' Rao? Amaterasu, while she can't talk, is full of character too, often yawning and laying down when a demon is threatening her. It's charming and I was in love with this character the first time it happened. Getting to roam around the world as a wolf instead of a human is great as well. The world of Okami is a relatively small one when you look at everything, but there's still a lot to do. Rather than getting experience or collecting souls/energy from enemies like a lot of games these days do, the only way to level up Amaterasu's stats is through Praise. Earning Praise is a fun thing to do in Okami, be it from simply feeding animals, completing a task for someone, blooming a giant clover or...oh you can do tons of things to get Praise.

The art direction in Okami is flawless, and I highly recommend getting the art book for it as well. Enemy designs are unique and varied. There are no enemies that are simply older ones but with different colors here. You'll face imps, tengus, mirrors, sea monsters, crabs that can fuse to create a shark, ogres, flying koi, foxes with masks, and that's just a portion of the regular enemies. The bosses here are some of the best looking I've -ever- seen in a game. It's just a shame that fighting them was either too easy or very boring. That's one of my few complaints with the game that keeps it from being 5 stars.

The other complaints I have mostly have to do with the controls. If you have an older ps3 that can play ps2 games, I recommend getting Okami for that instead of the Wii version. It's not that the motion controls are bad, but they could definitely be better. Amaterasu has three weapon types she can attack with: reflectors, beads and swords. The beads are the easiest to fight with, since you can just swing the Wii remote all over the place and connect. But the sword requires you to hold the controller up, then move it down to swing after its been charged. I couldn't get this to work most of the time, and was stuck doing 2-3 hits instead of big combos like I wanted to. The reflector has to be swung in a certain rhythm, and takes practice. Would it have been that hard to make it a simple button press like on the ps2 version? Drawing certain things with the brush was a pain too. Can ANYONE get a 100% success rate when drawing the lightning bolt? The game shows you what to draw- a straight zig zag like a regular bolt of lightning. Well, to get it to work, you have to curve part of it, and even when you pull it off, it's not a very accurate attack most of the time. Aside from these, I wish the game had real voices instead of Animal Crossing gibberish, though I kind of liked it since it kept the tone of the game just right. But part of me feels it'd be more emotionally compelling with real voices. Some of the cutscenes get tiresome too, especially when characters state the obvious, after you just told them what the problem is. I wanted to skip a lot of these, but held on in case I missed something important. Finally, the credits and epilogue are missing in this version. Why???

While it might seem like there are a lot of problems with the game, Okami has gorgeous art direction, a nearly flawless soundtrack (the only track I can't stand is the mini-game music), fun characters, a cool story, incredible enemy design, and is very fun to play. There were days when my daughter and I would just run around getting Praise or messing with animals, making them freak out just by making it rain. The game is never too difficult, and it's pretty hard to die even once. With how cheap it is now, I suggest just buying it and giving it a shot if you like adventure games, or if you're looking for something for your kids to play if they like story-driven games.","One of the best games I've ever played, and it's fun for all ages!",1317600000,3,{'Platform:': ' Nintendo Wii'},

The Blast and everything which follows is based around a shadowy group and the standard trio of gangs that take over in the chaotic aftermath.

Gameplay manages to be unbelievably entertaining, with little repetition, apart from random enemy encounters, though every fight racks up experience to unlock new powers. The powers themselves all manage to be useful, and theres no one power that you'll use all the time because its the magical power of kill-everything-now, apart from the normal blast, and none of the powers are overly broken. Despite your abilities, and even with the highest level of damage reduction, the regular peons still can be threatening, and if you let yourself get overly confident, you could quickly find yourself shot full of lead.

The morale system manages to be grey enough that certain evil decisions are less evil than just self serving, or better yet, let one suffer so I can help more. Apart from just randomly slaughtering civilians though, every decision does carry enough of a morale quandary to not be the ""power an orphanage vs. burn it to the ground"" decisions that plague other games. I'm looking at you, KOTOR 3.

Graphics are phenomenal, though clipping does pose problems at times, but the few bugs can work to advantage, as theres nothing that brings a smile like seeing a bad guy spin up, up, and away after being hit with an explosive shockwave. The buildings and high rises all look near photorealistic at even short distances. The lightning effect never loses its charm, and aside from the problem of too many explosions whiting out the screen, the effects have yet to disappoint. Probably one of the better visual effects is being wounded. Blood will splatter your HUD, and eventually your vision will begin to gray out, to the point that almost everything become indistinguishable grayish lumps.

Audio and voicing is also top notch, with entertaining characters, clear, crisp dialogue even at distance, and characters that actually feel realistic.

The difficulty is well balanced, though certain missions, namely rooftop races, are annoying trial and error mini-games, and several other standard missions are little more than grind sandwiches. But still, above all, massive props for having more than 3 generic rinse and reuse missions.

All told, aside from some annoying missions and enemies sometimes being clumped in battalion strength, this game is quickly rising to my top 5. Some of the story was revealed way too early(you'll know near everything about your powers and the Blast by mission 5), and there are some wtf missions, but otherwise, this game is engaging, well made, fun, and relatively bug free. Even many of the standard ""I only hate X about these kinds of games"" have been addressed. Fr instance, saving is segmented, so you won't start at the beginning of a 45 minute story mission, if you stumble with the controller and plunge into the lake. The finding missions all appear on your HUD, rather than being scouting nightmares, forcing you to scour every roof in the game looking for shards to up your health. This is one of the rare pieces that's easily worth full market price, as it'll encourage more of the same.

5,True,"04 18, 2012",A18T1BKNDSBWGN,B000ZK7ZOE,ITBeast,"I will admit I am impressed How Sony made this game feel like you were literally playing a Marvel Comic Book that you got to control the actions and ultimate decisions of the main character in the game. Similar to Sony's Uncharted Franchise except instead of feeling like you're in a summer blockbuster movie you are a Comic book character trying to resolve the moral dilemmas of your new found ""Super Powers"".

A Brief synopsis's of the game: You're a courier by the name of Cole, while delivering a mysterious package to an unknown address the package blows up and literally turns the city you live into a post apocalypse nightmare. Instead of being incinerated by the explosion you somehow survive (after being at ground zero no less) and are nursed back to health by your girlfriend Trish(who happens to be an EMT) and your best friend Zeke. To further complicate things even more the government has decided to put your city in a Bio quarantine status (meaning no one enters or more importantly leaves), the city is similar to New York's Manhattan Island. During your recoperation you learn to master your new found gift's (Cole's Powers are similar to that of Marvel's Electro mixed in with the strength and endurance of Captain America) and eventually set out to find out the truth behind the people who had Cole deliver the mysterious package.

Again, what I love most about this game it truly plays out like a Marvel Comic Book meaning that your given a character that most decide to either keep to his moral convictions or spiral down to a much darker path. The game allows you to freely choose between a ""Good"" path or a ""Dark"" path with decisions you will have to make during different areas of the game. While the story is pretty much the same thru out with whatever path you choose it does alter certain aspects of how the game will end once you have completed it. So in the End you will either be labeled as a ""Hero"" or just ""InFamous"".

They suck.  Not only do they suck...they suck like a transvestite prostitute at a Hell's Angels rally.  They suck like a court-appointed attorney.  They suck worse than St. Louis style pizza.  They suck worse than an animal shelter owned by Michael Vick.  They suck worse than Chicago.

Well...okay, it's hard to suck as bad as Chicago.  At least no video game based off a movie was ever home to the worst politicians EVER.

This game shatters that rule.  It not only shatters it...it obliterates it.

The gameplay is actually innovative and fun.  I had a bit of trouble at first figuring things out (the game didn't tell me how to deploy a trap...or at least I didn't see or hear it) but it has a little guide book to help you if you go into your menu.  There's research to be done (although it's hard to get a scan of a creature on the PKE meter when it's throwing a bus at your head).  It's neat to zap ghosts and feel like a real Ghostbuster like when I was a kid.  I grew up watching the Ghostbusters and remember how excited I was when they released Ghostbusters 2.

Which brings me to what makes this game shine brighter than any star in the sky...the story and voice acting.

You have the ORIGINAL Ghostbusters voicing their characters from the movie.  Bill Murray is fantastic (of course), Dan Akroid is absolutely hilarious as usual, Harold Ramis absolutely rocks the character of Egon with his usual intellectual wit, and Ernie Hudson returns with the straight-faced ""I didn't see no ghost"" one-liners.  Every.  Single.  Scene. Had my girlfriend and I laughing out loud.

That's the important thing about this game...it feels like it wasn't made to sell to as many people as possible, it was made for the fans of the original Ghostbusters as a way for Murray, Akroid, Ramis, and Hudson to say ""Thanks, everyone"".

I honestly view this game as a gift for my years of watching, quoting, and stopping on a channel that happens to be showing the Ghostbusters movies to grin because I know the funny part is coming up next.

""GET HER!""

That was great, Ray.  ""Get her"".  Real scientific.

""I just panicked...""

""Ray...if someone asks you if you're a god...you say YES!""

""THE FLOWERS...ARE STILL...STANDING!""

""Must have been some cockroach...""

""It'll bite your head off, man.""

If you don't know the movies...and quite possibly if you didn't GROW UP with the movies and cartoons then you probably won't ""get"" this game.  You'll play it and maybe rate it as average or slightly above average.

If you, however, ate, slept, and breathed everything Ghostbuster and can answer the question ""Who you gonna call!?"" in less than a second and with GUSTO then this game will have you looking around with a feeling of creepyness one second and then crying with laughter the next and then RIGHT back to jumping out of your skin and madly flailing around with your proton beam.

Back to the game as I'm getting off on a nostalgic rant.  There are bonus items in the form of ""Cursed Artifacts"" to collect.  There are ghosts to read about by scanning them and entering them into your Tobin's Spirit Guide.  There are also ""power ups"" to buy to improve your equipment and a running total of damage caused to all of the locations you visit.

If you, your children, spouse, best friend, or your pet are a fan of the Ghostbusters then you owe it to yourself to get this game.  I have a half played copy of Call of Duty:  Modern Warfare 2 sitting in the video game drawer that is seeing little playtime because I am now taking a trip down memory lane with the guys with nuclear accelerators on their backs.

So I'll say it loud and say it proud as I aim for the flat-top!

You start off in a coma, and you're asked to either re-create your guy from the last game, or make someone new. And this time, you can have a girl play as Stilwater's legendary gangster! You can go around the 'Saint's Row' equivalent of Chicago as a male or female.

The character customizations have been far expanded, and rival that of another THQ franchise, The ""WWE SmackDown! Vs. RAW"" series. You can fine tune just about any facial feature to your liking, and once the game starts, you can buy your way up to owning cool clothes, which are far superior to the first game's clothing options. Even in Sloppy Seconds, you can customize color, material, and style of your clothing. Of course, keep in mind that Sloppy Seconds has some pretty awful clothes, too! I had my guy back in Saint's Purple in no time! The women's clothing is far less appealing though, although maybe I just haven't unlocked the hot Victoria's Secret wear, yet. The character cutomization truly is more advanced this time around, but a little bit of things irk me in the customization.

For example, you can't choose height once again in your character. In the first game, the Protagonist was way too short. About 5'6"" or so. In this, he's kinda too tall. Maybe 6'1"" or 6'2"", but he (or she, as females have the same towering height as your men) completely towers over everyone else in town. Also, the body options are kinda weird. It's like, you can only choose a body ""type"" for them, like obese, or thin, and you can't fine tune things, like their stomach or chest. For women, their breasts are kind of too pointy. For men, their body shape is kind of odd, with big arms and a slightly disproportionate body (assuming your guy isn't an obese fellow). Some things are kind of too in-depth (like ear customization, for example. Who cares about ears?) While the body customizations could've been more expanded. Also, the ""Personality"" features aren't as in-depth as I was hoping for. Basically, you choose voice, walking style, compliment taunt, and insult taunts. The voices are basically White, Black, and Hispanic male and females. The White guy voice is British, probably because the game developers are also, British, and they wanted a local guy in there. I'm guessing most people will end up using the Black Male voice or White Female voice. The gender equality goes beyond your main character though, and also shows up in the gangs, too, as before, only about 10% of your enemies were female, as now it's about 40% of women in the enemy gangs. And it seems like the entire police force seems to made up of women, which is a little odd.

When you actually begin, you start off with a prison break, and get access to the newly expanded fighting system. While very simple to use, it's actually quite hard to master, and I like that. Basically, you can punch two different ways, do combos, and block. There's other things you can learn later too, like the new Human Shield option, where you can toss people acorss streets like they're only 10 pounds light. Of course, this is just for your basic fighting style. You'll learn new ways to brawl later in the game, as well! You also now also pick up inanimate objects like cinderblocks, trash cans, or virtually anything, and use them as makeshift fighting weapons. Your non-firearm weapons have greatly been expanded, and the variety of different melee weapons rivals that of San Andreas. However, in this game, you can make much cooler use of them! I stongly suggest once you hit the streets of new Stilwater, to find a Ronin gang member and steal his or her katana blade. That thing rocks! Both objects and newer melee attacks are also available in Grand Suck Auto IV, but Saint's Row 2 makes much better uses out of all of them! It's a complete no contest here in which game's are better. With weapons, all your favorites are back, and the annoying habit of constantly having to switch out guns for ammo to get different ones that have been taken off of your enemies is gone! Because now, we have dual-weilding, baby! Your guy or girl will be able to shoot out two Vice 9's, at once, now, and do it like the pro they are! Unlike San Andreas, you won't have to level up skill points to earn advanced weaponry weilding because the game assumes your guy is already a master of the firearms from the first game! I love how convient Volition are! They're willing to cut the crap (like having to swim miles to make it to shore) and just give you the fun gaming goodness you want from the get-go! When you deal with explosives, if you're too close to the blast, it'll blast out your character's ear drums and they'll be temporally deaf! It's a nice touch with really shows you how much explosives can mess your character up! Saint's Row 2 also gives you Autosaving, so if your game freezes on you or the power goes out, you can start off from the last mission or activity you completed. Autosaving at first doesn't seem to useful, but once an unexpected something DOES happen to you or your game, you'll be so glad it's there! I made it to Lv. 6 of Drug Trafficking and didn't save any of it when my 360 shut down on me. But with the Autosave feature, I was able to restart from the end of Lv. 5 and not lose a thing! It's such a great and convient feature to have!

Once again, you'll have to earn respect to do new missions, but the Activities now are a lot more fun, and many of the lame ones from the first game, except the stupid Insurance Fraud ones, which I've always hated, are gone. Activities are now divided by Diversions (the lesser, old Activities) and the true ""Activities"" now are the ones that take much longer time to complete, such as Chop Shop and Hit Man, which once again make a return. I hopped in a car with my girl and immeadially started a Drive-By activity on some Sons of Samedi. Now, in the Diversions, there are six levels instead of eight, and for some, you can continue up to each level without interuption. I didn't even know I was on Level 5 in Drive-By until I actually checked up the top of the screen. The new diversion activities are awesome. ""vehicle Surfing"" is tricky but fun, until you fall of the car, that is! In ""Trail Blazing"" you get to race to a checkpoint all while on fire, blowing up cars on impact and lighting people on fire, earning time. It's sort of a mix of Mayhem and Racing, and it's very fun. ""Fuzz"" is the Stilwater equivalent of Cops and you get to play as the all-around corrupt police officer, hurting people breaking the law, and getting good and violent footage for the TV show. By the further levels, it gets really fun and interesting, like stopping a Pirate-Ninja war! ""Crowd Control"" has you playing as a celebrity bodyguard, stopping mobs of crazy fans from hurting your client! Depending on the level, you can trhow people into chopper blades, toss them into attack dogs, crush them with a bulldozer, cram them into an airport security x-ray machine, or chuck em into an oncoming el train!

There are more ways to earn respect now, too. Inspired by the Balls Meter from the ""Scarface: The World Is Yours"" game, you can now earn respect by doing ballsy things that Tony Montana did in his game, like driving in the wrong lane of traffic and taunting bad people like cops and gang members, and also now pimps and hoes, who are now official ""enemies"", as well. The only thing missing is the ability to yell at people who crash into your car while driving. Just don't get TOO much respect before using it up on missions, though, as after Lv. 99, your respect is Infinite, and that sort takes all the fun out of it, having Infinite respect and all.

The new Stilwater is a much darker, depressing place than the old Stilwater, which is ironic considering that the old Stilwater was probably much more violent. It's about 50% larger, and the new places are less inviting to you than you'd think they'd be. They clearly don't like your kind around there. The new gangs have a bit more unity than the old ones did, and respect each other's territories, leaving the endangered Third Streets Saint's pretty much their only common enemy. Many parts of old Stilwater have been rebuilt by Ultor's multi-million dollar city renovation. With Ultor Corporation owning Stilwater and turning it into a bleak metropolis for the Upper Class and snobby, you'll have the incredible feeling of both familarity and newness, all at the same time. Some old, favorite neighborhoods will look familar, but will be dark, barren and full of bums and prostitutes. Others, such as the humble Saint's Row, have been completely taken over! Seems like at least 20 years of change since 2006, though, when our old familar Stilwater was Ultor-free. Only a few list of people actually return for the sequel, but luckly, it's all the ones you would want to see return, including your best pal, Johnny Gat. Also in Stilwater are the new gangs. They also follow the same trend of having a Drug gang, a street punk gang, and a Corporate Business gang. Taking the place of the Latin Los Carnales, the Caucasian Westside Rollerz, and the Black Vice Kings are the Haitian Sons of Samedi, the Caucasian Brotherhood of Stilwater, and The Asian Ronin. The fourth, ""unofficial"" gang are the Ultor Corporation, themselves, and they run pretty much everything in new Stilwater, including all of the police. The Ronin are probably the deadliest gang, as they all carry katana blades and chase after you on high speed motorcyles, which comes off as a lot more vicious and scary than the standard street car pursuits the other gangs do. I won't say too much, but there's a little bit of ""Kill Bill"" as you progress through the Ronin storyline. They're definitely the best to take on out of the three. The Brotherhood of Stilwater are basically just giant-sized bullies. They're all very large people with even bigger vechiles. They like violence just for the sake of it. The weakest gang has to be the Sons of Samedi. Bascially, all they do is sell ""Loa Dust"" (a kind of cocaine you smoke out of broken lightbulbs!) to college students. They're all very easy to take out and all of their vechiles are pretty weak. With these new gangs though, comes new vehicles, such as bikes, boats, and planes. They're all just about as cool, if not better than the selection in GTA: San Andreas. There are also plenty of new cars, including three new ones that put classics like the Zenith and the Attrazione to shame. Even though they're now a lot more common in a Stilwater that caters to the heartless and corporate republican Upper Class, you'll probably want the three new luxury/sport cars even more. They are the 'Hayate Z70', the Ronin's offical car, the 'Bezier', which is like a MUCH better Attrazione, and the 'Superiore', which is like a Lamborghini Countach. Just don't own more than two of each or else, you'll ruin their rareness of owning them.

The graphics, which I've yet to mention, are incredible compared to the old game, and yet, still have that Saint's Row ""toony"" look to them. They almost rival GTA IV in their beautiful lighting effects and such. Saint's Row 2 now, also like GTA IV, has the ""blurring"" effect of when you go too fast in a car or quickly turn the opposite way while running. The beauty of the new Saint's Row really makes you appreciate your 360. Name-brand artists are now featured for the music. No longer any obsure, underground third-rate Hip Hop stars. Arguably, it's a better sounding soundtrack than Grand Theft Auto IV (At least in the Hip Hop department, anyway). This time, when you listen to the radio, it actually sounds like you're listening to the *real* radio, thanks to the more mainstream artists and songs. The one thind thing that sucks though, is there's only about half the number of songs on this game compared to the original. There's also no more custom playlists, either. Instead, you get your own radio station to replace your old audio player. But at least the music is from people like 50 Cent, Nas, Fat Joe, Joss Stone, and Kelis. They're not my favorites, but I know people out there like them. Unfortunately, Aisha singles are still circulating around... not much we can do about that, though. And no, Saint's Row 2 doesn't allow you to go to the Cabaret for a nice Sunday evening out, or have your character watch TV while you're watching him watch TV!

Saint's Row 2 is a bigger, better, more FUN version of the original! I'd rate it about a 4.75 out of 5! *JUST* slightly short of perfection! There are some little problems still around, like the ragdoll physics of your character, and the fact that a six foot fall can still pretty much kill them. Also, don't expect EVERYTHING to be new and wonderful! But, would you really want the game to not have ANY shades of familiarity in it at all, anyway? If you liked Saint's Row the original, then it's virtually impossible to dislike Saint's Row 2! It's very, very easy to lose coutless hours in this game with all the fun, exciting, and crazy things you can do. It's the FUN game Grand Theft Auto IV failed to give us! There are tons of enhancements and new features in the game which will make it THE game you'll still be playing a year from now! (or at least, longer than you did with that Rockstar title!)

5,False,"04 15, 2009",A2W3JMA1P62IXL,B000ZKDOV2,Jeff Travis,"While Rockstar has been exploring `relationships' through Video Games, Volition has quietly caught up and perhaps surpassed the GTA series with the latest installment of Saint's Row 2.  I'm sure the purist won't appreciate the humor within the Row, but quit simply this game is fun and it replaces tediousness with all the elements that originally made the GTA series so great.  It has Jumps, Side Activities, Story Missions, Cribs (aka safe houses), building purchases and a whole lot more.

For years I have been hoping the game companies would grow up with the rest of us in regards to multiplayer.  Frag fests are fun with the right group, however when you want to tool around with a buddy or spend time gaming with the wife it just doesn't cut it.

Thank you Volition!  You've joined the ranks of Rockband and Left4Dead in providing us with a game that can be played as designed together. 80% of my time playing Saint's Row 2 has been riding shotgun with a buddy of mine and it's so much more fun than going at it alone.

With the complexity building an entire game supporting multiplayer there are some glitches and bugs.  Honestly in the 20 hours of playing with my buddy, I've been extremely happy at how few bugs we have encountered.  Yet they do exist and a few of them can be quite frustrating when it prevents completing a mission.

3,False,"10 17, 2008",A37KAUN3Q2765G,B000ZKA0KA,M. Voltaire,"IMHO, this sequel of the SOCOM franchise is an excellent, fun game with the following pros and cons, respectively:

- Close-quarter combat feel of SOCOM II
- Larger maps for 32 players
- Upgrades of SOCOM II maps (Crossroads, Desert Glory, Frostfire...)
- Small (16) and large (32) players versions of maps
- High resolution graphics
- Realistic sound effects
- Color customization of uniform, clan shield, face...

Cons:
- Some maps are too large for 16 players resulting in the rounds ending without all kills
- No offline version for practice (and in case the servers go down)
- Somewhat laggy
- Certain guns sound somewhat muffled even at point blank (maybe too much bass from my audio system, uncertain of reason)
- Game starts even when Seals/Mercenaries ratio is very unbalanced

Other thoughts:
The installation, download of update patch is somewhat inconvenient. 20+ minutes to install the game to the hard drive followed by the 1+ hour of patch download can really test one's patience especially when expecting immediate play. Game was purchased same day of release date yet needs a patch right out of the box? SOCOM Confrontation Online Team states
""Due to the tremendous launch of SOCOM Confrontation and large number of simultaneous players connecting, we are experiencing some server load issues..."" yet no one can tell how many players are actually online since there is no players count such as the one in SOCOM II. Currently, logging into servers is also a throw of the dice. ""Server initialization errors"", ""Unable to connect... rank, ratios... will not be saved"", game does not start even when all players have ""greened up"" issues plague this game.

Recommendation: borrow from a friend or play COD4 and wait until Christmas to get this game as a gift.

3,True,"08 26, 2010",A2K9BFRX8DL0K5,B000ZK698C,SCF,"I have an affinity for gangster games that take place in the 1920s through 1950s. As someone who enjoyed the first Mafia and liked the Godfather games (even the second one was tolerable), I looked forward to Mafia II.

Players of the first game will notice is that Mafia II is almost identical to it. Other than a slight shift in time period, this is practically the first game, remade. Right down to sticking with the mechanics of the faux-open-world instead of the modern open-world implementations (most notably, only having one mission available at a time in a very linear presentation).

While not the most beautiful game, it is definitely pleasant to look at. The city and vehicles are well rendered and feel alive. Mafia II's developers have spent much of the past year talking-up their whole ""living breathing city"" technology. They tout how realistically the people on the street react to events, for example. Frankly, I never saw it. There was nothing more realistic about them than in GTA IV. In fact, they could be dressed in period clothing and you'd never know the difference.

The most important thing to point out here is that the game has very little ""game"" to it. You are essentially driving across huge portions of the city from one cut-scene to the next. Then back home to sleep. Then back to your friend's apartment, to talk. Then to the next cut-scene, across the city. Occasionally, you might be told to interact with something which involves pressing one button that shows up on the screen (""press X to interact with this item""). On a few occasions, you might even find yourself firing your gun or punching someone or sneaking around a building. The majority of the game, however, will be you driving a car (without speeding or running into anything so as to avoid arrest or fines or expensive damage to your ride) across the entire city to watch a cut-scene and hop right back in your car to move on to the next cut-scene in another part of the city.

There are also a few significant glitches. Around the mid-point of the game, a mission directed me to follow a guy across the city. As I tailed him, his own car got into an accident and veered off the road, getting stuck between a building and other cars. After some time passed, the mission automatically ended in a fail-state. Penalizing me not for my skill, but for its own poor AI. I also read another reviewer on a popular gaming site who had a similar experience, but in his the guy he was chasing was killed in a car accident caused by the AI.

Then there are the checkpoints. Seemingly entirely random with no thought given to their functionality. A failure may set you back to a checkpoint that requires driving across the entire city again and watching another cut-scene, just to get to the point where a check-point *should* have been.

The lack of game may be more enjoyable if it was a great story. Instead, it's a very generic story. In fact, it's just a mix of parts (often directly lifted scenes) from various gangster movies over the decades, glued together. It's an entertaining enough story that you'll want to see the resolution to, but when you look back on the tale as a whole, it isn't set apart from every other GoodFella's rip-off you've seen.

As I mentioned, this is not an open world game. The only ""open world"" part is you driving across the landscape as you like. But there's not actually anything to do in the world. At any one time, there is one thing to do. One mission marker you go to and do something at (usually, watching a cut-scene). That's it. You can purchase from your choice of perhaps half a dozen wardrobes. You can go to the gun store (though I never bought a single weapon in the entire game, playing on hard, and never felt I needed to). You can rob stores to earn cash, which I never felt necessary throughout the entire game. You can steal cars and take them to a chop shop to earn money, which I never felt I needed to do. You can stop and buy food to replenish your health, which (again - on hard settings), I never felt I needed to do. In fact, I never did any of these things, because I always had more money than I needed, just from playing through the story.

If you're a fan of open-world games, I would not recommend this game. If you're a fan of Mafia stories and don't mind the generic ones, I'd suggest picking this one up when you can find it discounted for about half the retail price. If you are an enormous fan of this genre and loved the Godfather games and the first Mafia game, this might be for you. However, there doesn't seem any point in replaying this game and nothing to be changed or experienced differently in doing so, which leads me to suggest even to fans that they consider picking this one up only if they can get some sort of a discount.

There aren't enough classic gangster games, so I appreciate this title. It's just not quite the experience I was looking forward to. The atmosphere and characters are worthwhile, though, and I'd like to see them iterate on this concept with a Mafia III some day.",For those with an affinity for the genre.,1282780800,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

3,True,"07 6, 2010",AOYGPHW4YMYEO,B0010AYJXI,Shaide,"The game was fair but slightly ruined by poor controls. However, I do want to clarify now that, while the controls did take a bit of getting used to, once you were used to them, they were quite easy and comfortable, and to be honest, I can't imagine playing the game any other way. So, the controls were great, graphics and sound was superb, the acting was wonderful and the story was enjoyable. Overall I would have to say Alan Wake was a pleasurable experience.

Although, pleasurable as it might be, it was far from perfect! I've given you the pluses, now it's time for the negatives.

To begin with, the game felt like a long playable commercial for energizer and Verizon. I think I saw ""Energizer"" more times than I saw and heard the name ""Alan Wake"". Perhaps they should have just called the game ""And going...and going...""? I am seriously surprised that at some point the energizer bunny didn't come beating his drum across the screen.

Next, the game is way too short! The game is divided into 6 ""Episodes"" which is basically 6 levels. each episode can be finished anywhere between 1 to 2 hours, depending on how hard-core you are playing and how throughly you are investigating the locals. However, what this means is, you could in theory beat the game in about 7 or 8 hours. Now, normally that's not a huge thing, since most games feature an Online play mode, however Alan Wake doesn't offer any online play. Your gaming experience is just those 6 episodes. Although more ""Episodes"" will be arriving soon in the form of downloadable content(More on this later)

Another thing I dislike about the game, is that many of the ""Action"" segments take place in the woods. Now during the first 2 ""Episodes"", that was kind of cool! The woods are a scary, and creepy and offer plenty of places for monsters to hide. After awhile though? Come on! It gets old! There's only so much running around trees a person can do before they start to lose interest! Once they get bored of the same repeating settings, then they are going to start getting bored of the game!

The next negative? Well, that would be the ending! Now, I am not going to include any spoilers for anyone, but what I am going to say is that the ending is lame. It's one of the worst game endings ever. It doesn't even seem like an ending at all really! There's so much just left hanging and in the air, and what little excuse of an ending there is just leaves you scratching your head dumbfounded.

Now, granted! Maybe the ending wasn't really an ending, but instead left open to leave room for the downloadable content. Maybe the ""Huh?! Factor"" will be resolved with the coming episodes. Possibly. However, I feel that it's kind of a rip off. Like they sent out an unfinished product, expecting you to pay the amount that one would pay for a full length game, and instead they receive an unfinished game, and a code to get the next episode free, however the second DLC you are of course expected to buy. In essence, you have to pay AGAIN to finish the storyline that SHOULD have been finished in the final product! It's ridiculous! It's like they are trying to milk you out of more money than their game title is actually worth.

Yes, I know other companies have DLC as well, and to be honest, some of them I think are ridiculous, for instance the modern warfare DLC map package. However, some companies like Rockstar actually provide QUALITY DLC items! For instance Grand Theft Auto IV actually finished! It had an ending, then they released 2 other DLC packs that contained whole new storylines, that were connected to the first, but could be played separately and enjoyed and felt that you had a quality gaming experience with an actual ending.

Would I recommend the game? I would recommend renting it. Like I said, it's a pleasurable game, but it's also a quick game!

I tried a few Yoga classes when I was in college but decided to concentrate my efforts into a more hard core martial arts workout. Stupid me, I could have done both and been all the better for it. Still, after being becoming somewhat more adept at the 15 Yoga poses in Wii fit, I felt I needed more and the inexpensive Let's Yoga cart did the trick.

I love Wii Fit Yoga but Let's Yoga really adds so much more to the Yoga experience. Wii Fit is a pretty good (but small) comprehensive warm up but ""Let's Yoga would be like the real class. I would imagine a typical Yoga class might cost somewhere in the range of 10 to 25 dollars for one session. Just about the cost of the Let's Yoga cart. Imagine, you could do Let's Yoga for a few weeks and become familiar with a lot of the Yoga poses.  And then when you are ready for an in person classroom instructor, you will not be lost with all the poses.

The Lets Yoga instructor is also pretty good about explaining how to get into the poses. The cart even allows you to stop the session and reposition the instructor to view the pose from different angles. There is even a place in the cart that explains (and shows) all the various Yoga moves on the cart and even offers options for getting into the pose. And unlike the Wii Fit you can even design your own Yoga Workout.

The gameplay was pretty good, but I found a couple glitchy spots when playing in Free Play mode, and by the time it got done loading between scenes or from the college to the chosen adventure, I was falling asleep.

You meet Alessa, a younger Dahlia, and other characters from the first game (no spoiler, this is explained right in the booklet). Some connections and explanations are also offered which were pretty vague before. Lights and sounds also seem to draw monsters far more than other games (didn't seem to make much difference in the other games). The mirror idea was pretty cool too although it seemed to give you some controll over this horrific world.

The downside...
I was disappointed by the ""new features"" in this game. One is the use of fixed camera angles which I actually liked in resident evil. They could've worked here too but weren't handled as well as the RE games. At times a monster may be 2' in front of you but its off screen so you don't know until you either walk into it or shoot blindly. A couple times you walk down an aisle and disappear until you walk out- who knows if anything was there to pick up or examine. In other SH games camera angles may be used but at least you can hit a button and look around.

New combat features include punching... which makes sense (always thought it odd in SH& RE games that your options are basically run or shoot- noone can kick, etc). But on the other hand, I restarted this game and it takes something out of the ""scare"" when you can just walk up to the monsters and punch them into submission. Another combat feature is the ability to pick up assorted items for striking. At the end of the game however, I had a truck load of appliances and items which I never used. How many TVs, crates, etc did I have in my pockets?

As for the ""scare"", well there really wasn't one. This is more of an action game with horror elements that a disturbing horror tale. This is the only SH game that I made it all the way through without EVER getting killed. (I did run more than usual, but still, even the bosses were pretty easy).

There are also some movement differences and they couldve given you clearer reasons for going from one place to the next (If I hadn't looked at the map after leaving the hospital I wouldnt have known where I was supposed to go next).

Sure, graphics get improved, physics get augmented, various minor creative strokes get added; yet, the basic concept stays the same: build your city, keep the majority healthy and happy, maintain your finances in the black. In an attempt to spike this with a little RTS, skirmishes have been added lately. IMPERIUM ROMANUM is one of those cross-pollinating attempts.

Graphically the game is very well made. Zoom in or out and the detailed textures do justice to all of the buildings and environmental elements - whereas, the sounds follow the zooming level, getting louder as approaching. The citizens, though, feel like animated plastic toys, and seem out of sync with the rest of the imagery.
What I found particularly disappointing (for a game released in 2008), was the...sudden appearance of the structures getting built! I mean, if (7 years ago!) EMPEROR OF DUNE managed to have the buildings progress on screen, why do I see a worker hammering on the ground the foundations one moment and the finished, say, city-wall segment appear the next?

Rome was not built in a day; it will take something like...10-12 hours to complete its first run, with little replay value. Unless of course one is a Roman era aficionado.

Finally, IMPERIUM ROMANUM tries to incorporate some RTS elements in the form of skirmishes. Tries and fails. These skirmishes feel like a rushed afterthought and offer little to the overall gaming experience. Because an army has to be maintained, special buildings have to be built (barracks, archeries etc), on top of the usual city utility necessities. Likely, the interface is simplified and intelligent and this makes controlling the game easy. In the end, though, it is not worth the extra hassle.

Overall, IMPERIUM ROMANUM is a good City-Management game that has little new to offer besides improved graphics and a well below average RTS.

She of course does a number of impossible acrobatics, but that's part of what makes this game fun.  The scenery and textures are beautiful.  The water and lighting effects are superb.  While much of the game takes place deep in the earth or underwater, there are moments of big sky and bright sunshine.  Without a doubt, the visuals are the game's greatest strength.

The sound effects and music are nice as well.  The voice acting is fine enough, but I found it difficult to hear some of the dialogue during movies and cut scenes.  I had to blast my speakers to make sure I could catch all of it.

The narrative is somewhat unremarkable.  The game is about playing around with Lara and seeing what she can do.  I really didn't care anything about the plot.  The game is way too short, but I imagine there's some fun in replaying a level to find all of the treasure.

The game's greatest weaknesses are by far the horrid camera perspective and clipping issues.  You have very little control over the camera, and it seems to zoom in and out of its own accord, quite often locking your next ledge off screen, so that you have to guess and risk Lara plummeting to her death.

2,False,"01 25, 2011",A2BAWLYA43PJYN,B0012N94WO,Mr. Staack,"Let me preface this by saying I've played just about every Resident Evil / Biohazard game, including multiple ports and remakes on various consoles, and even the Famicom predecessor Sweet Home.  I was even a contributor to a guide book for Code Veronica, and have a very good minimum-ammo speedrun for several games.  I'm quite familiar with Resident Evil's bloodline and style, and have excelled in them.  As well, if you look through my history, I almost NEVER give bad reviews for games or review games that aren't marketed towards me.

With that said...  I think, had RE5 (and RE4) come out in 2002 or 2003, I would have given it 4 to 5 glowing stars.  However, I find RE4 and RE5 are very tedious and frustrating, as the developers adopted a slightly-modified version of the old ""mansion crawler"" control scheme (RE 1996 ~ RE:0 2002), and plopped it into an action-oriented 3rd person shooter, when the 3rd person shooter market has since evolved to more-precise control schemes.

Having played numerous other modern 3rd person shooters, I feel like I'm fighting the controls more than the enemies.  I would be more lenient with the controls in the context of Silent Hill or Fatal Frame (which, ironically, still control better), where your protagonists aren't trained combatants... But in RE4 and RE5, it's so bizarre that battle-hardened elite soldiers like Leon, Chris or Sheva can't do ANYTHING and move at the same time.  They can't shoot, they can't swing a melee weapons, they can't charge through an opponent, they can't reload, and they can't even heal without literally locking into position.  As an avid shooter, I understand that run-and-gun isn't very effective in real life, but having done numerous defensive shoots I know it's possible with practice and appropriate armaments.  I'm not an elite commando, and somehow I can maneuver through our range's Halloween animated zombie target shooting gallery and get high scores with a P.O.S. rental Hi Point or Soviet era C&R pistol.  So, I guess I just expect that elite BSAA agents can do AT LEAST as much, especially since they  seem fine moving around with guns drawn and trained during cut-scenes - jarring to say the least.  This also gives the enemy AI a distinct advantage, except when they're clearly scripted to accommodate for the controls (i.e., infected will run at you with a weapon raised overhead, instantly stop right in front of you, and then execute a slow attack animation that doesn't always match their charging pose) which is just as jarring.

The tired ""it's more challenging this way"" excuse is a cop-out.  Removing 3 buttons from the controller or disabling diagonals would also make a game more challenging, but breaking a game (especially without some context, like the character is injured, untrained, or a cheap 2 channel remote control tank) to make it harder is just bad design.  Especially from Capcom, whose development teams all should know better.  ""The controls are classic"" also seems like a cop-out.  Code Veronica had similar controls, and I loved the game...  But Code Veronica came out in 2000, on the Dreamcast, and such controls were still state-of-the-art or the best they could do with the given system and controllers.  Plus, it was still largely a mansion crawler, with emphasis on exploration, puzzle solving, and enemy evasion.  The controls worked in that context.  RE4 and RE5 are designed to be much more action-oriented (it's nearly impossible to proceed unless you kill EVERYTHING on the map), and should have had control schemes to match this evolution.

It's not all bad.  The game is VERY beautiful, and I still appreciate the convoluted Resident Evil storyline (though I hope a reboot comes soon).  Co-op is a great idea, though I've found myself hating most of my online partners (but that's not Capcom's fault).  The AI partner is at least decent, if a little too exploitable, though sometimes feels like one more level of micromanagement that detracts from the action.  I like many of the ideas behind the game, and would have liked it if the control scheme matched the style the developers had put forth (a 3rd person shoot-em-up).  Had it been a classic mansion crawler, like it's predecessors, I would have been far more lenient with the controls and enjoyed the game far more.  I was frustrated with the game from beginning to end, and have stopped playing it after only one play-through.

This is an awesome open-world third-person shooter with MONTHS of play value!!!

Your character is some kind of South American operative at large in a LARGE island country ruled by evil dictators.  Or something like that -- I'm more interested in the missions and random mayhem than the back story!

The more mayhem you create -- CHAOS! -- by blowing up government installations, the more missions you are awarded by various revolutionary groups scattered around the country.

The controls are spot-on, you have access to lots of weaponry and vehicles -- include choppers and fighter jets -- and the graphics are excellent.  And did I say the country is HUGE?  Well, maybe not as big as the US of A, but it's big enough to encompass a variety of terrain from snow-capped mountains to beaches to lush jungles.

At a price of under $20, the purchase of this game is an absolute no-brainer and IMO one of the best values in gaming.  And I haven't even tried the online multiplayer.

Highly recommended for fans of blast-'em-up shooting action!

UPDATE: I have put in more than 80 hours playing this game so far, and there still is a ton more to discover -- and blow up!  In fact, I saw a message stating that I had only discovered about half the locations available on the island.  That means I can expect more than 160 hours of single-player playtime in this game, and it's all killer, no filler!

IMO this is one of the most fun open-world third-person shooters I have ever played, the lack of funny radio stations in the vehicles notwithstanding.  If you like shooters, you REALLY need to play Just Cause 2!!!  And NO, I don't work for any of the developers responsible for the game...

UPDATE NUMBER TWO: I just have to emphasize my enthusiasm for this game again.  I have played a ton of video games since the days of ColecoVision (!), and I don't know when I have ever spent so many enjoyable hours playing a single game.  I have now put in well over 100 hours of game time here, and the end is nowhere in sight!  The ONLY downside is I know I am going to experience MAJOR withdrawal symptoms when I do finally beat Just Cause 2.  Fortunately I have also heard whisperings that Just Cause 3 will be coming in 2015, and I for one will be elbowing others out of the way to pick up a copy. Did I say this game rocks?  Yes, I did, up, down, over, and under, inside and out.  Scorpio!  Scorpio!  Pick up a copy, and you'll see what I'm getting so excited about.  (And did I mention I'm an old geezer who doesn't get excited about very much these days?)

The World Ends With You is one of the quality games that Square Enix has ever made, period (and dare I say better than most of the stuff that Square Enix has given fans for years). This game just moved up on my top ten DS games of all times (DS games) and is ranked very highly in terms of RPG games (its up there with Disgaea and Tales of Symphonia).

The story is about an emo teen named Neku Sakuraba who wakes up in the middle of Shibuya with no memory of his past and suddenly being able to hear the minds of people. He's suddenly attacked by a frog monster called a Noise forcing him to retreat to the statue of Hachiko where he makes a pact with a girl named Shiki Misaki. She explains to him that he's involved in a Reaper's Game and how they must work together to survive 7 days to get out of Shibuya. The only problem is Neku is a loner and would rather shun the world than help someone he doesn't even know. Little does he know that while in the Reaper's Game, he'll understand what the power of friendship means.

This game was on my list for a long time with comments on everything about the game is better than what Square Enix has made as of late and its true. This game is HARD, has awesome music and believable characters that is easy to relate with. The world of TWEWY is very unique and even though you're playing the game for 3 weeks in game, you feel like you're on a journey.

The game is VERY hard. The game WILL punish you if you don't understand how the mechanics work. Yes people play differently with the pins but some pins are needed to win on higher levels. The game is difficult with the partner system where you and your partner shares health (the bosses do too) and you get a game over if one partner is killed in battle. The computer is not that good being an AI sadly (le sigh) so you have to do ALL THE WORK (again) in terms of controlling them. This makes the game even harder though as you have to pay attention to the top AND bottom screen. Neku fights on the bottom with a variety of tactics while the partner is stationary at the top of the screen with limited options. The game ranks you based on how quickly you kill the opponent and how much damage you take. The less damage you take, the higher your score. The goal is usually to get an S rank (star) to get the most out of the BP system where you can level up your pins. And of course the game actually doesn't tell you that the pins can evolve depending on how you level them up (by battle, tin pin (I hate this game!) or turning your game up and evolving via time you stay away from the game).

The battle system overall is very fast pace and you can't make any errors on higher levels. Outside of battle, you can equip Neku and his partner with items (and its brought up that if you match the items based on the area they are in Shibuya, the higher the sync rate and damage in said area. To wear an item, you need a high bravery stat (which Shiki starts with a high bravery being a girl and all followed by Joshua for obvious reasons) and you can only wear one item per section (so its not as awkward like in Disgaea where you can for some strange reason equip two glasses). Also the character can eat regular food like in the actual game because this game is very realistic in that you can only eat a certain amount each day and then wait 24 hours before you can eat a bigger meal. Each character has their likes and dislikes and its based on their personality. Beat loves fast food but hates sweet while Shiki is the exact opposite. Joshua clearly states he's a ramen person etc.)

The partners themselves are all useful in their own way. Shiki is your first partner in the game. As the only female partner she has the advantage of being able to equip most of the items given at the beginning of the game and is easy to get a combo with given her special ability on the top screen is just her matching up the card symbols. Alas, her biggest weakest is the fact you lose her after the first week and while she has the items when she joins in near the end the game her attack becomes pathetic in comparison to the other characters. Beat has the advantage of being the last partner to pair up with. He's fast and has a high defense of his defense is terrible and he's rather wavy when he attacks given he rides on a skateboard. Plus, his ability requires you to get pairs and sets on the card game of hearts, clovers, diamonds and spades (in honesty, I'm not going to pretend like I know how to play Beat and I just attack the way I attack). Joshua is the hardest partner of the 3 to master especially given how he starts out in week 2 as pathetically week and I don't know if it was just me but HE JUST STOOD THERE during the week 2 day 1 boss. I mean I was having a hard time on the bottom but he did no damage whatsoever on the top and its like ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" Yes Joshua gets better near the end of his week when he decides to start levitating but come on! You make a hard game even harder! Alas, mastering Joshua is crucial for beating bosses on higher difficulties especially the bonus boss as not only is it easy to spam attacks while levitating but levitating works better in terms of dodging.

The characters are still the best. All of them have their strong personalities and flaws. The flaws are why they're in the game to begin with but without spoiling their backstory, I'll just say that each character turns out better by the end of the week. Neku is the main character who gets better so while its easy to hate his personality at the beginning, by the end of the game, he's a very likable protagonist and because he becomes more like a hero is important to the end of the game for a certain character.

The music is the best and its even better when you realize Neku is the one listening to the music in battle. The music changes constantly so you're never stuck with the same BGM and on the menu option, you can basically change it to how you see fit after you buy the CD. Personally, Calling is my favorite version (and I can see why people complained when it was changed in KH:DDD) and Give Me All Your Love is so...heh heh. And I still want to know what the song Twister is talking about.

1) I get frustrated when I am wandering around the African jungle looking for a tiger in a tree and I can't find it. Or I can't figure out how to get to where the giraffe and elephants are sleeping.  There needs to be a ""help"" screen you can go to when you get stuck.

2)  When I first started playing, I really began to feel the effects of motion sickness!  You have to control the camera (Wii remote) movements so you aren't racing around in circles and feeling nauseous.

This game can be a lot of fun.  I appreciate the challenge when I finally figure out how to get down those cliffs, waterfalls and hills to the other side.

I don't think this game is for ""Everyone"", because I could see younger children giving up during those long stretches where you can't find the vulture sitting and you aren't given anything else to look for, and the guides aren't talking.  There is only so long you can listen to chirping crickets without giving up in frustration.

I don't like that when you find something out of order, you don't get credit for it if you take a picture of it.

Other than those little complaints, I really do like the game.  When I'm accidentally bumping into white rhinos, lions, a porcupine, or elephants, or having them charge me my heart races like I really need to get away fast, LOL).

TS2 is the worst out of the three because risk shots are near impossible to do and really takes away an important feature (and fun factor) to the game. So far TS3 feels a lot more fun and challenging to play.. with one complaint, the risk shot feature. Its still difficult to use but a little better than in TS2, at least now I am able to perform power serves and aces on a consistent basis. 2K needs to seriously rethink the risk shot system and make it a little easier since its frustrating and a chore to use. With that complain aside, once you go through the Top Spin school and get the hang of the timing and positioning the gameplay is incredibly fun. Graphics are top notch and authentic as well, better than VT3 IMO. Nice little details like the players start sweating later during the match and get grass stains on their clothing.

-easily 200 hours of gameplay for OCD completion freaks
-hilarious amalgam of famous dictators (Mao, Marcos, Baby Doc Duvalier, Kim Il Jung, etc.)

The bad
-PC bugs
-irritating and time wasting game mechanics

Bugs and basic game mechanics make this game a little irritating to play.  Little things like having your black market weapons/vehicle purchases disappear if you die or exit the game.  Having manual saves put you back at checkpoints.  And there are a couple of bugs on the PC game.  The one that really sucked was when you are sent to blow up an offshore oil rig.  If you attack it and destroy more than 15% but less than 85% and then die, you will not be able to finish the mission.  That's because when you start up again, the program doesn't register what you've already destroyed in your fist attempt when you blow it up again.  And you need to get to 85% to finish the level.  So if you blew up 30% of the targets in life 1, your maximum possible score in life 2 is 70%.  It took me a while to figure this out, and I wasn't the only one.  To fix this you have to completely exit the game, and then restart it and that will reset the damage meter.

This game really could have used more dev time (although what game doesn't?).  Refining the game mechanics and eliminating the bugs would have made this a easily a 4 star game.

Other thoughts: My favourite two mods were playing as Kane (the hot helicopter pilot) instead of the grizzled dude, which made the game easier on the eyes.

4,False,"03 28, 2012",A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B0014CN2H6,Richard Baker,"The Good: Great story, interesting battle system, decent voice acting, beautiful anime cut scenes

The Bad: Generally the same, woeful graphics, loading......

I heard all the hoopla about Persona 3, but the next gen craze side tracked me from it. I finally rented the game and I have to say I am very impressed. I'm tired of the same old random battle JRPG with clich stories, characters and battle systems. P3 tries to do something different with practically every element. When you start the game out you'll notice the game has beautifully drawn anime cut scenes. The story doesn't become very clear until after you start playing, but this is OK.

The first thing I have to say is that the game takes FOREVER to get going. Maybe 5-6 hours into the game you'll really start getting interesting and most of the play mechanics and taught. When you're not fighting you'll be living your regular school life by studying hard and preparing for exams. The game has a calendar event setup and you go to school, talk to some people, you can choose to stay awake in class and listen to the lecture to increase your academic skills. Sometimes you'll have to answer questions (it's mostly guessing) and maybe your charm will increase. After school you can meet up your friends to strengthen your Social Link (more on that later). Depending on the responses you choose will affect your relationships. You can also go around shopping at the mall for items, weapons, armor etc. Another thing I have to mention is there isn't enough to buy before the next moon phase (more on that later). So you there is one new thing for each member and that's it. This can make traveling the upper levels of Tarturus even harder (more on that later).

The game's story is about Shadows that try to wreak havoc during the Dark Hour which is midnight. During this hour the Dorm you stay at turns into a mysterious tower known as Tarturus and you must climb the tower fighting stronger and stronger enemies. Every 30 days you fight a boss and some event happens that evolves the story. During those 30 days you have to increase your Social Links, level up, and acquire all that you can before the big boss. When you fight in battle you use your Personas which are like Aeons (think Final Fantasy) and they are your strongest attacks. You'll rarely attack yourself so you always concentrate on your Personas. Some Personas have different magic abilities etc. The battles are won by determining the enemy's weakness and exploiting this. When you hit their weakness you get one more turn and that enemies falls down. If you get all the enemies to fall down you can do an all out attack where all the players will maul the enemies for extra damage. This is key to mastering because you can die very easy early in the game because leveling up takes longer that it should. Luckily you can switch Personas in mid battle so you can exploit accordingly.

One irritating thing about this game is they changed the elements' names. Instead of Fire, Ice, Wind, Fire it's Zio, Bufu, Garu (light) and it's really stupid. Why did they do this? Probably just to be cute, but it confuses you and you have know idea what these names mean. Once you win a battle you may get a Shuffle Time which lets you see faces of a card and it shuffles them around. Some may give you bonus experience, some may be new Persona, some may be weapons. While you run around through Tarturus you can see the Shadows so this game isn't random. If you hit them first you get an advantage, but let them hit you and it's not so good.

The game mainly evolves around Persona so, of course, you can make your own. Take your cards to the Velvet Room and you can combine them to make better Personas. Now there are attributes and rules, but these are confusing and pointless so you just add a few up and see what it makes. It's really simple and easy to use, but you can't do this for a while because you can only create Persona that are at your level. Also in the VR you can take requests from Elizabeth by bringing her certain items at certain dates for rewards. I found this very hard because you never really know what she's talking about half the time. I think it's mainly there for completionists.

Social Links effect your Persona because if you have a friend that is a Magician SL all your Magician Persona will level up faster. Of course there are events every day that always change. Sometimes you can't go to Tarturus at night because your members are too tired, some may get sick, some may be busy studying for exams etc. This changes things up all the time so not one day is the same. When it all boils down is that the game is generally always the same. Go to school, go to Tarturus over and over. There are no worlds or levels to actually explore so this may disappoint some people. When in doubt pick up Persona 3 because you are going to have a blast and there are dozens of hours of RPG goodness here. With decent voice acting, memorable characters, great battle system you will truly love this game.","Great story and characters, but hard, hard, hard",1332892800,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Vesperia has taken almost everything I loved about Symphonia and improved on it.

Let me just get this out of the way now. The biggest flaw with Vesperia is its story. A lot of Tales games have confusing stories but Vesperia takes the cake for being the most confusing on an hourly basis. In other Tales games you know what you're trying to achieve more or less from the beginning. In Symphonia you're trying to save the world from decay. In Abyss you're trying to stop the miasma. In both games the situation takes numerous complicated plot turns that completely alter the manner in which you're expected to succeed in your task or even what that task means, but on the whole the initial quest leads directly to the end quest. In Vesperia you have no idea what's going on until you near the end. At 30 hours in I still didn't know what was happening and I had no indication that the world was in danger at all. After every major event Yuri asks Estelle whether she wants to continue on her current quest (which changes repeatedly) or investigate some new incident. The party is constantly struggling to find a reason to stay together. There's not really the sense of unity that the other games had. This is all tied into the game's theme of growing up and deciding your own path, but it's a really bad idea from a storytelling standpoint.

Now if that sounds bad, well, it kinda is. But it's not as frustrating as it might seem. This is largely because of the characters. Vesperia has assembled one of the best cast of characters I've seen in a video game. Yuri Lowell is the lead and he's a ball of laughs. Unlike other Tales protagonists he's not quite as kiddish (he's 21, an old man by Anime standards). I was very impressed with what they can do when they have a more mature character like this. When the game goes for the stereotypical Tales character reveals (gosh, is that obvious princess really a princess? No...) Yuri reveals he's known the entire time and just hasn't bothered to tell anyone. You can feel his self-satisfied smirk at watching the others in shock. His friend and foil is Flynn (an NPC unfortunately). He's the second part of the duo and is essential to the question that drives the game: is it better to work from within a crooked system to try and change it from the inside, or to oppose it directly knowing that it means not much will get done. Yuri takes the latter approach, Flynn the former. As you might imagine this leads to some conflict but also some really interesting exploration of the issue.

The other characters are good too. Estelle is totally not a princess. Honest. Raven's the untrustworthy scoundrel type who's always whining about his old age (he's somewhere in his 30s the poor man). Karol is a kid who wants to overcome his fear of, well, everything, in order to become a guild leader and respected person. Rita's very angry and likes hitting people. Judith is... odd. Let's leave it at that. Repede is a dog. With a  pipe. Yeah, I don't get it either. These characters are fun to watch and we still get the great Tales cutscenes that reveal background details and conversations to expand on the plot and characterization.

The mechanics of the game are basically the same as earlier ones. We still get an open world and enemies you can see approaching and sometimes avoid. Fighting is done in a fighter game format and real time. Your companions are computer controlled, although you can determine the tactics they should follow or override their commands. The graphics are much better than in Symphonia, while continuing the same cell shaded style. Instead of the big headed wide-eyed spheres of that game we get more realistic Anime figures.

I don't think this game quite beats Symphonia, although it definitely has areas where the improvement is massive. The plot is to blame for this defect, but it's never bad enough to make the game anything but fun. You want to find out what happens to these characters, even if you don't necessarily want to see it told in this way. The cities are charming, the gameplay first rate, and the plot (when it finally shows up) decent.",Awesome Characters Make Up for Weak Plot,1422144000,,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

I was very dubious about picking this up as it's predecessor has one hell of a reputation for being scary. Thankfully while the game is still very creepy and there are a few ""WTF!"" moments sprinkled here and there, the ride was still a ton of fun.

He has the ability to enhance his speed thus slowing down the action on screen long enough to pump whatever's bothering him full of lead. The speedy regeneration of this ability, coupled with the copious amount of ammo and gun types lying around means that as long as you're careful, you'll never be caught in a fight you can't handle.

Speaking of guns, this game has some of the most satisfying guns I've ever played with. Enemies meet their end in very messy ways with some even being torn in half.

Sims 3 is a major... drain on your PC, it's true. It's not nearly as much of an overhaul graphically or even gameplay-wise as Sims 2 seemed it was to the original, but then again, how could it be when there was such a leap forward in playability between there.

The Sims 3 gets a lot of grief for not being able to play multiple families, if there was one thing I see over and over and over, that is it; but you CAN play multiple houses within the same game, if you bother to look deep enough within the menus, buried in there is the option to change which ""active household"" you're playing--or, crazy enough, someone could just learn to read instructions which clearly point the way (once you do it once or twice you are unlikely to forget the simple click-thru routine).

That aside, the Sims themselves this time around are much more ""living"" people rather than being barbie-dolls that you must tell to do everything and anything, they really seem to have some greater spirit involved in everything they do, from animations to decisions they have, and especially the upgraded ""Wishes"" system (aka ""Aspirations"" from Sims 2) all tend to feel more organic, with much more rewarding goals to earn with all of those Lifetime points. Instead of buying silly things like life plants and face changing vanities, there are many-leveled, permanent gamechangers that change how your sim interacts with the world (eg. Observant helps your sim almost-instantly pickup on friends' personality traits for better conversations, Slacker helps your sim slack off at work while still getting a good performance, and so many more).

Between this new wish/reward system and the new ""Style creator"", this is easily worth the money. With the Style Creator it takes the idea that the Sims 2 introduced--of being able to click on some furniture or wall patterns or appliances--and added it to virtually anything you can buy or build within the game, making EVERYTHING that's material now virtually customizable! It truly opens up the aesthetics of the game, which helps to feel immersed and like this is your own.

Good graphics compared to many other RTS games I have played.

That all sounds fantastic, but don't lose sight of the short (but VERY SIGNIFICANT) list of CONS:
--------------------------

*Limited Installations mean you don't really 'own' the game, you're just renting it at full price. (if you're buying a retail copy, and not a copy from Steam)

*SecuROM (again, assuming you're getting retail and not Steam) This SecuROM stuff that RA3 will install on your computer before you're able to play is BAD NEWS.  Many people have had serious difficulties with their computers after SecuROM has infested them, and apparently it is not very easy to get rid of once it has infested your computer.

*The RA3 Tanya just wasn't as good as RA2 Tanya.  Kari Wuhrer did a much better job, and the actual Tanya UNIT is not as fun to play with either.  Tanya's range has been reduced to a point where enemy infantry (yes, even conscripts) can now shoot Tanya before she can shoot them.  Tanya is no longer the sort of ""hero"" unit that, with a small amount of support and a good deal of micromanagement can wipe out whole platoons of enemy infantry and bases with style.  This was a huge negative, as Tanya has played a very central role to the Red Alert universe for several of the Red Alert games now.  Going back to the Kari Wuhrer point though.. Kari was much more ""tough"" whereas the new Tanya is basically a cheerleader dressed up as Tanya, and she really just doesn't fit the role as well.

*Tanya's guns just aren't as good (or cool) as they used to be.  Looks like she's got some Desert Eagles now or something instead of the classic old .45 colts, and her range has been reduced to a point where she is basically neutered as a unit.  Not cool.  I don't even use her anymore to speak of because of this.

To sum things up, you'll probably enjoy the game, but it just lacked some essential things Red Alert 2 had.  However, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you purchase the game on STEAM instead of in boxed retail form, since STEAM will not include any of the activation limits or SecuROM malware/trojans/spyware type of crap that will infest your computer if you install the retail version.  I might have given the game 4 stars or so if not for the negatives I listed.  Due to SecuROM in particular, I'm gonna have to give this a measly one star.

I didn't have most of the game play problems that others have mentioned. The cover system seemed to work fine in the crouch position. Stealth, martial arts & shooting worked better with a little practice & each upgrade to AP etc. Stronger AP for the assault rifle, toughness, martial arts, and tech attributes helped a lot. Adding more endurance & health bars too. Upgrade his armor since the AI will as you progress in the game. Purchasing better armor does protect him more as well as buying & selling intel at times. Also, the special gadgets were easy to use and very useful!

Using martial arts was entertaining and fun, I didn't have any issues with the controls or actions.
Stealth was very sensitive since I didn't upgrade it much but even then, sneaking up behind the AI always worked and then you can either kill or take them down. Don't be wearing noisy armor or step on creaky boards etc, it won't work then! lol

The only negative to me is that I don't think it was fair to sell the game at full price since it has quite poor graphics along with bland environments & some other issues most games don't seem to have these days. I assume the developers & all involved didn't have much of a budget to go on.

They're unresponsive and difficult. Selecting a planet or area to go to will often have your spacecraft circling all over the screen and disappearing to the upper left. Selecting items in the menu requires multiple attempts to simply touch the command you want.

The time based mini game that you have to complete somewhere around 30 times on varying difficulties, to progress to the next area is irritating. This would a great idea if it weren't for the touching screen and multiple falling blocks wasting time.

The first couple of times of beating the game are very fun, especially with friends, I will hand it to Blizzard. The art is nice, the music is not bad, and the environments are somewhat interesting.

Then you reach the brick wall that is known as Inferno (the hardest difficulty) and you realize what Blizzard has been planning all along.

The mobs in Inferno suddenly become godlike and all your gear becomes instantly obsolete. Elites and even regular mobs will kick your ass unless you upgrade your very quickly.

To make matters worse the game PUNISHES YOU for playing co-op on Inferno, the already disgustingly difficult mobs become near godly and unless you and your friends are supremely geared it's going to be an excruciating exercise in futility.

Problem is that 95% of the loot you get in Inferno is literally garbage, so bad that even the NPC vendors will be reluctant to accept them. Magic find increases the chances of getting yellow items, but chances are they are still crap.

There are far too many possible attributes during item rolls, so as a result you will almost always get items which make no sense whatsoever (example: Wizard hat with Strength, or Barbarian sword with Intelligence, etc.) and weapons in Act 4 of Inferno with 200 DPS. It's infuriating.

It is so bad that when I killed Diablo on Inferno he dropped only blues, and not just any blues but TERRIBLE blues, stuff so bad you wouldn't even use it on Hell difficulty.

So you're thinking to yourself, WHY WHY WHY would they do this?! Why make the mobs so difficult and the gear so bad?!?!

WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE REACH THE GOAL OF BLIZZARD'S GAME DESIGN IN DIABLO 3: THE REAL MONEY AUCTION HOUSE!!!

As stated Inferno is so ridiculously difficult and the loot generally so bad that the ONLY WAY to progress is to use the Auction House.

I only managed to beat the game by bidding low gold on items and shopping intelligently, but it took wayyyy longer than it should have. Not only this, I was BASICALLY FORCED TO USE THE AUCTION HOUSE TO BEAT THE GAME.

Trust me this isn't just unique to me because I suck, 90% of my friends gave up at Inferno Act 1, those that stayed have had no choice but to use the Auction House as well. The game isn't skill dependent, it is only gear based.

PROBLEM IS that the gold prices of items have flown through the roof due to inflation, botters, and exploiters. So expect to see any half decent weapon for at least 10 million gold, which is no small amount of money.

So a lot of people have resorted to using the Real Money Auction House and it's absolute chaos. I've seen people spending over $500 (yes real cash) on a SINGLE ITEM, a virtual item folks that will probably be obsolete in the next patch or expansion.

I personally don't believe in spending real money on video game items (especially absurd amounts like stated above) but to each his own.

-----

So I really can't help but feel like the entire game was designed to revolve around the Real Money Auction House. The difficulty is absurd at inferno, many of the bosses are basically gear-checks (can only be beaten with certain amounts of DPS) and the loot is so bad that you have no choice but to use the Auction House.

This game is a money grab, it's pay to win, and I'm not sticking around for when they implement Player vs. Player where it's going to be the battle of the credit cards.

I will admit that I got more than my money's worth and it was fun at times, but this franchise has been ruined and this is by FAR the worst Blizzard game I have ever played. I will not remember this fondly like I do Diablo 2 or the Starcraft Series.

You take the role of Van Helsing, vampire hunter, on the bloody trail of Count Dracula. The game begins in London, where Van Helsing has just received a letter from Jonathan Harker.

Dracula: Origin is plenty dark and gory; the game is rated T, and there's certainly a lot of blood and gore (including graphic torture, mutilation and satanic rituals). The game's locations (London, Vienna, Cairo, Transylvania) sparkle and really add depth to the story; puzzle-wise, you spend a large amount of time in Cairo exploring the market, museum, and several residences. Sadly, the section in Transylvania felt more like a tacked-on afterthought. The ending is super-brief, but I enjoyed it.

Graphics: the prerendered backgrounds are generally very intricately rendered, with period touches (detailed paintings, tapestries, etc.). The character animations are somewhat less successful; Van Helsing's movements are wooden (this is a third-person perspective, so you're watching Van Helsing move *a lot*). The cutscenes are beautiful, though. Lip synching is somewhat off in cutscenes, but it's generally not a distraction. The load screens are more of a watercolor wash instead of rendered (and load times are short).

Sound: the background music is generally unobtrusive, with a piano-based score that includes fear-drenched organ and quivering strings from time to time. For some reason, the music in Cairo reminded me strongly of Big Fish's soundtrack to their Blood Ties game. Sound effects are very good. It's obvious that English was the second language; there are some subtitles in particularly that don't mesh with the recorded dialogue. Also, Van Helsing got on my nerves; his melodramatic, gasped ""Closed!"" at finding doors locked was grating.

Gameplay: Dracula: Origin is an inventory-based game. You only pick up what you need, and it's generally pretty obvious what goes where (although some solutions are a bit of a stretch). There are several puzzle varieties including decoding, sliders, logic puzzles, and find-the-items. The game leans towards the easy side, with plenty of hand-holding; on many occasions, I longed for a more difficult solution. It would have been nice if two different difficulty levels had been included (beginner and advanced), but I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzles.

Are there some shortcuts in design and graphics that I found annoying? Yes. But Dracula: Origin looks great, plays well, and is certainly one of the better-looking adventure games to come out recently. Because of its intuitive puzzles, this is a perfect first game for those new to adventure gaming.

MK vs. DC brings this series back to it's roots and it's a lot of fun. The fatalities can be lame but they still do what they're supposed to - give you closure to a hard fought victory.

The fighting engine is a little stiff but it doesn't hinder the game play and you get used to it relatively quickly. Besides, I found it more enjoyable that Soul Calibur 4.

Bottom lins is that the game is fun. I received it today and played through the arcade mode with Scorpion and I can't wait to play through it with the other 19 characters.

I hope Midway keeps this engine and fine tunes it for future MK releases. Here's also hoping that the next one is a mature game too. I like the DC characters though and this is a nice one-off game.","Very, very fun!",1227398400,14,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I haven't played a Mortal Kombat game since Mortal Kombat II on the Sega Genesis.  But, I thought I'd give it a try.  So far I haven't played all the way through the game, but I have made some observations:

1) The graphics aren't too bad, but there are some spots where it is almost painfully under par (e.g. at the crux of the arm/inside of the elbows where the arms bend, it almost looks like a plastic toy).  The animation isn't the best, either.  I've definitely seen worse, but I do expect better from the machine that is supposed to be the biggest baddest thing on the market.

2) The voice actors really stink.  I don't think there is a single character in the game where I could say that the voice actor was good quality.

3) There isn't really any plot in the storyline

4) Arcade mode is exactly what you would expect and delivers in classic Mortal Kombat style.

5) Combos just don't work the way they're supposed to. After attempting the combat challenge, I can say that you have to be way too exact with the timing of your button-pressing for most of the combos to work.  It becomes extremely frustrating very quickly.

And that is it from me on this game.  I am waiting to receive the game guide that I bought from Amazon, as well.  We'll see if maybe reading up on this game helps the enjoyment.  So, look for my Mortal Kombat vs DCU game guide review in the not too distant future.","Eh...fun, but not great",1342483200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5,True,"06 30, 2008",A3QQGPI3CTV9SX,B000VJRU44,skf1965,"The other night, after indulging in some greasy lower-Manhattan takeout, I received my Wii Fit from Amazon.  I put the box near the television, took some Rolaids, and resigned to test-drive Nintendo's new fitness machine in the morning.

The next morning I warmed myself up for a high-tech exercise experience by playing some of Marvel's Ultimate Alliance and some Paper Mario on the Wii's Virtual Console.  After a few of hours warming up my fingers, I was ready for the Wii Fit.

The game is simple enough to setup; the installation of some batteries and an uneventful synch up of the Wii Fit Balance Board with the Wii console are about it.

My first session with the Wii started with entering the date, my age, getting weighed, and an initial body balance test.  Wii Fit used those data to calculate my Wii Fit age, an embarrassing 47, about 12 years ahead of my actual age. I immediately repeated the body test and scored an ego boosting age of 31.  Much relieved, I listened as the Wii helped me set fitness goals. It told me I should shoot for a body mass index of 21 instead of my 24 (i.e., lose some weight).

Based on my Wii fit experience so far, the technology's strength lies in two areas. First is its variety. There's a large variety of strength, balance, aerobic, and stretching (yoga) exercises, with additional exercises unlocked after completing basic sessions. The more you use Wii Fit, the larger the selection of exercises.

Wii Fit's second strength comes in its coordination of the balance board and the Wii's position sensing tech. The system does a good job of tracking where the user is and integrating that into game play.

I like Wii Fit's aerobic exercises the best. In the meat-world, I enjoy running, so it wasn't really a surprise that I liked Wii Fit's running exercises. It gives me the opportunity to run with a dog, something my real dog shrugs off all requests for (She usually responds to my requests to run with a ""you're joking right?"" look.). If you have other Mii's on your Wii, you'll occasionally see them run by you. There`s also a never-ending supply of people waving at you and cheering you on during runs. Before Wii Fit, I'd never would have guessed running in place could be anything but boring and awkward.

Again, the Wii's positioning system seems well suited to keeping track of my running-in-place gate. The running exercises start with short intervals and work up to a free run mode.  Be sure to wear sneakers while Wii Fit running.  Running in place can be hard on the forefeet.

On the down side of the aerobic games, Wii Step seems to be a bit on the slow side. It's like a lazy Dance Dance Revolution.  It's not that Wii Step is boring, it offers some insanely catchy, but unvaried, music and the advanced version of the game is fairly challenging. The problem is that Wii Step didn't offer much of a workout.  In the accompanying video, when I look at my watch, I wasn't checking the time, I was checking my heart rate.  My average heart rate during Wii Step clocked in at around 110bpm, about my heart rate during moderate walking. Still, the ability of the balance board to detect my position was a real high point of Wii Step. Also, I swear I saw Greg Allman in the audience watching the virtual step class.

I also haven't been able to get the hang of the aerobic boxing class.  Wii Fit consistently misses my left, or I have a terrible left. I can't tell which. On the plus side, the boxing exercises push my heart rate higher than the step classes do.  The boxing sessions also have the interesting initial shock of suddenly appearing shirtless with an overly butch shirtless man.

The strength and yoga exercises are not as fun-oriented as the balance and cardio exercises, but are focused and straightforward with good instruction from very non-Nintendo appearing fitness trainers.  I'd never attempted any yoga until Wii Fit and was able to follow the exercises and feel like I was accomplishing some real stretching. The pushups with side-planks also offer a decent body-weight workout.

Wii Fit's balance games have offered me the most challenges.  They're fun too. You get to play as a fishing penguin on an ice-float; see your Mii's transformed into rolling balls; play a boy in the bubble floating on a river; and do some skiing. A note on the skiing: the slalom steering is exactly the opposite of what you do during actual skiing (In the game, leaning to the left makes you go left.). That took some getting used to.
According to my exercise watch, I've been burning between 300-450 calories per 45-55 minute session. That's less than what I'd burn at the gym, but more than what I'd burn playing Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, or even Resident Evil IV.

I'm enjoying Wii Fit and I can feel some muscle soreness in my hips from the strength and yoga exercises I did yesterday.  I think that's the point of Wii Fit.  It offers palatable exercise in the privacy and convenience of my home. I'm more likely to play Wii Fit after a long day at work than I am to pack up my equipment and run to the gym.

The only other note I'll make is that after four days of play, at about forty-five minutes per session, I've already had to replace the Wii Balance Board's four AA's. Having rechargeable on dock is advisable.",Gaming from Couch Potato to Buffed Tomato - Wii Fit,1214784000,17,,

I suppose that my expectations could be considered to high. This game is nothing more than an upgraded version of Lineage 2 meets World of warcraft. You have a WoW style quest system in a Lineage 2 style world and lore. Open world PvP which is not optional as well as a very steep grind. If you are the type who enjoys to quest for 10-12 hours to gain a single level then maybe you will be able to reach the level cap in this game. From my personal experience Aion has a much steeper grind than WoW so if you are looking for something more casual, or an upgrade to WoW I would say try other games first. This can be a fun game but only if you are willing to put in the huge massive amounts of time it will take you to level up your character.

Along with the terrible grind you also have a broken security system. In the 2 months that I played this game 3 people in my Legion were hacked and their accounts suspended. They did absolutely nothing wrong in fact I knew one person from another game who came with me to try this one. Ncsoft does a terrible job at keeping the game secure and your account can be compromised at any time.

Typing or sending messages through PSN is an option every single user has and thank goodness for it as it has provided millions of people another method to keep in touch with quick replies back and forth. The only issue with using the PS3 controler to type is time. The amount of time it takes to send a simple message like

""Hey, watch out for the sniper! He's gonna be behind you in about 30 seconds!""

takes about nearly an entire 60 seconds to compose and then send! By the time this ever happens, my team mate is already done and dead. In any real situation, time is money! Even in gaming! Wining is money and having a faster way to transfer communication with multiple users on PSN is one of the very necessary things for me.

The underwater visuals are incredible from the sea floor, hidden treasure, coral, caves, sunken ships, schools of fish, dolphins, manta rays, whales, and much more. Sunlight from above will also filter down below the surface.  Day also turns to night and you can go night diving where you may find different types of sea life.

Now, when you are on the boat, it's a different story.  The visuals look incomplete. The boat, character, water and skyline all have a ""unpolished"" look to them.  Also, your character apparently has something  shoved up his or her rear as you walk around the boat ""stiffly"".  But, this is all minor stuff as you will be underwater most of the time so, it's not a big deal. Again, the underwater world is absolutely a joy to the eyes.

The music is nicely done and very relaxing, but you can load up your SD Card with .MP3 files and listen to your own music while on the ship or diving below. That is a very nice feature and I believe only the second developer to implement this feature on the Wii so far.

You will also be able to customize your character by changing your diving wear and equipment.

The game is totally laid back and you can pretty much do whatever you want, when you want.  But you aren't completely on your own. There are definitely specific things to accomplish if you want to. You will receive emails from people wanting you to investigate a specific underwater location, find a special fish or hidden treasure, take photos or even to go along with you as a diving guide. Many of these result in rewards such as new equipment and gear.  You actually should accept the first few email requests as it's the only way to get the underwater pen and camera and to unlock the Wi-Fi Connection gateway.

You will help a dolphin early on in the game and he will then become your partner and you can go on dives together. The dolphin will actually help you find hidden items on the sea floor. You can also have the dolphin do tricks up above while you are on the boat.  It looks like you can have up to 3 partners to play with. I've only found the dolphin so I don't know what the others will be.

I haven't tested the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection feature, but you can have a Wii friend come over to your boat (or you can go to their boat) and you can go on dives together. Looks like that can be fun. You can communicate with various pre-set greetings and commands or use an underwater pen to draw or communicate (like a whiteboard).

Typically, a game on normal mode on the Xbox 360 version will last about 3 hours, but on the PC it would last around 12 hours. Also, there are not nearly as many different types of units and buildings as before. Nor are the options like treaties and trading nearly as diverse.

What I've always had a problem with Civilzation is that there really is no actual single player campaign. It's more of you rather play against someone online or a bunch of computers. Therefore, Civilization loses its edge after a short time.

On a positive note, the gameplay is smooth, the graphics are standard, and the strategy side is still very much there. There are five modes of difficulty and you can also download maps that change the game to give you a lot of money, have the barbarians be a lot more hostile, have the building be a lot faster paced, things of that nature. A pet peeve for me is that the achievemants were pretty easy to obtain and although AP don't mean anything in reality, I take pride in having 17000+ points. So I didn't mind earning about 700 AP in a week or two of purchase without trying.

So get this game over other strategy games like Halo Wars (eye rolls) but don't expect to be playing this game for more than a month or two. It unfortunately gets dull and repetitive after a while.",Fun But Dumbed Down In Comparison To The PC Version,1261094400,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

5,False,"11 11, 2008",A105S56ODHGJEK,B000WQ3838,Peace Daddy,"Tons to talk about with Midnight Club Los Angeles so I'll get right down to it. With the extended wait for this release, I had high hopes and Rockstar delivered on every one of them. The graphics on here are much smoother than on Rockstar's other big release this year, Grand Theft Auto IV. Frames flow seamlessly and this game looks incredible when played on your HDTV. When you first pop this game in and start your career, you're given a horrible hooptie that you're expected to start winning races with. Don't be discouraged, this game is pretty hard at the start but once you get into the flow of things, you'll find yourself winning races, racking up cash, and driving much nicer vehicles.
If you're looking for a storyline, you're better off going with Need For Speed Undercover, because Midnight Club LA has no storyline. Sure, you'll meet people along the way and there's a few cut scenes here and there, but this game is all about customization and racing.
The customization possibilities on here are literally endless. You are given full access to every shade of every color imaginable, as well as all sorts of shapes, designs, and letters that you can use to create whatever your heart desires on your car. Once you have your car looking the way you want, be sure to upload it to Rate My Ride and check out the creations of others while you're at it. If you're confident in your work and you make your ride purchaseable, you stand the chance at making some free money from others buying it. Your ride can sell online an unlimited number of times, and all the while you get to keep it along with the cash it makes. The one flaw with this that I've noticed is that once your ride gets 8 or 9 ratings, it really sits without being rated at all after that, and you're better off deleting it and reuploading it for a chance at more ratings.
One thing we were disappointed in with this game is the omission of custom soundtracks. You do have the option of playing music directly from your PS3 harddrive while playing the game, but it makes it pretty much impossible to change songs easily while you're racing like you can with the game's built-in soundtrack. Also, you cannot play your music while playing online.
The gameplay itself is great. This may be the best racer yet released for the PS3 or Xbox360. Los Angeles is absolutely stunning, especially when viewed at 200+ miles an hour. There's not as many gigantic jumps on here like there were in Midnight Club 3, but there's still a decent amount of air to be had. There are also 60 collectibles (yellow Rockstar canisters) hidden throughout the city. When you find these, you can open up all sorts of different cheats, but the cheats cannot be used in races if you want to earn cash or further your progress. The game also brings back the use of special abilities. Agro, Roar, and Zone are all back once again, and MC:LA introduces us to a fourth special ability called Emp. Emp releases an electric charge that temporarily disables all of the cars around you. It's interesting, but it can be very frustrating when used. If your opponent is directly in front of you and you use Emp, your opponents car reacts wildly and you really have to watch yourself or you could end up in a messy situation. Whereas with Agro or Roar, if your opponent is in front of you and you use either of those, there's little to no possibility of you crashing into them.
Online play is decent but does come with a few flaws. The frames get jerky at times, and at other times during a race your opponents cars appear out of nowhere, or appear to drive right through you. Other than that it works, and the ability to earn cash in online races is an added bonus, although it's not nearly as much as you earn during regular play.
Overall, Midnight Club Los Angeles packs a punch worth every penny. If you're a fan of any of the earlier Midnight Club releases, or just a fan of racing games in general, I would highly recommend this game.",Perfect continuation of a great series,1226361600,,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I had no idea of what was to come when playing this and HOLY WHOA!!! This game is truly among the most disturbing and terrifying games I've ever played on the xbox 360 and surpassing what I felt when I first played the original Quake, Doom, and even Mortal Kombat games back in the 1990s. This game, known as ""Dead Space"" to me is a brilliant cross between Resident Evil, The Thing (1982), and the 1997 movie ""Event Horizon"".

 This game is of a story of a planet-cracking mining ship called the USS Ishimura that had a crew of over 1000 but then contact with it was lost after it encountered an alien artifact called The Marker. A team comprised of protaganist Isaac and several others are sent to investigate and search the ship for survivors as they are unable to establish contact with the ship. What they discover is horror beyond imagination.

 This game truly is among the best games ever made but man oh man, it truly is one of the few games that I can say truly scared the daylights out of me. Enemies will spring out with no warning, in darkness, in poor light, and through any opening imaginable. They are truly frightening, ruthless, and horrifying on every level.

 Play this game on a dark, rainy or stormy night, or late at night, with the lights turned off, and the volume up loud. Whatever you do, prepare yourself for real frights and galore. I've never felt so disturbed or scared by a video game, not even by Resident Evil, Quake or Doom. And because of it, ""Dead Space"" and it's sequel are among the best games ever for the PS3 or Xbox 360!

I couldn't believe it kept getting me, but it did!  The key is that it doesn't inundate you with enemies like most games (which kills suspense).  You are also rarely ganged up on, which is nice (but you better be ready at ALL times).  My only complaint is that the game character is a bit sluggish (compared to Halo 3 for example), but this only adds to the realism.  How fast could a person really run around wearing a heavy-duty work suit and wielding a big tool for a weapon after all?  And speaking of tools, nearly the entire weapons arsenal is industry tool based (in a distant future of course).  I found such an approach to be an awesome (and unique) experience.  The sound track is unbelievable and really adds to the intensity and suspense.  The graphics are also excellent which of course makes a game like this even more realistic (and scary).  The storyline and voice acting are also top-notch.  If you are brave enough, turn off the lights, crank up the volume and really let yourself get immersed in the game.  If you are not creeped out in short order something is probably wrong with your amygdala.  Highly recommended.

It was a lesson, really, to teach me that movies weren't real so that I would stop hiding under the couch whenever my step-dad let me stay up late to watch KTVU's ""Creature Features"" on Friday nights.

It was also the most heart-pounding, tense, gritty, awesome space adventure I'd ever been on. I was blown away, and it made me an instant master of the horror genre - nothing else would ever come close.

Fast-forward thirty years (30 years? crap, i'm getting old) and umpteen ""horror"" video games, and nothing else had ever managed to provoke that same level of newness, excitement and sheer terror. And then I started playing Dead Space.

The story of Dead Space is tight and (mostly) believable. I won't recap the entire plot, but it was refreshing to be a ""normal"" crew member thrown in to an extraordinary circumstance. The introduction of the story and the amount of time it takes to get from ""start"" to ""holy crap, how do I kill that thing?!?"" is pretty long (4+ minutes), but it is worth it for the complete picture of the story it lays out.

The true glory in this game are the various creatures (mesomorphs) you have to battle as you make your way through the ship. They get increasingly harder to kill, as you get increasingly more effective weaponry. I have a friend who worked on the game, and he insisted that they designed the game so you could make your way through it with the most basic weapon: the Plasma Cutter. I took him to heart on that, and kept that as my weapon of choice on my first time through.

Dead Space has incredible visuals, the mesomorphs are freaky (the babies-turned-attackers are downright sick and nasty), but what really sets this game apart is the gameplay itself. Headshots alone won't get you out of a jam: you have to learn how to dismember your enemies, and even then they'll continue to crawl, scratch, or drag themselves after you.

If there are downsides, it is the similarity between how each level starts & ends. The inter-ship tram is pretty much the go-between for each level. Once you're back at it, you know you're safe, and know that when you start the next level you'll make your way to a new portion of the ship, get one to five minutes to explore before all hell breaks loose. But each level has a different challenge to it that you have to figure out. Which weapon to use on what set of enemies in what order all makes a difference. It's a strategic puzzle of dismemberment and mayhem. Sweet.

Also, DS follows the old-school ""big boss"" scenario, which seems a little dated, especially when facing the ginormous boss at the end of the game. Some levels have ""bosses"" others don't. A small chink in otherwise glowing armor.

Speaking of armour: you can collect cash and items worth cash, then spend the money at various stores throughout the game. Never before have I so immediately opted to upgrade my armor. Usually I get the big gun, then upgrade the defense: not in Dead Space. Every time I got the chance, I upgraded the suit.

Once you finish the game you can go back through on the same difficulty setting and keep all of your accumulated weaponry and defenses. Sweet. Never been a better reason to play a game a 2nd time.

As you have heard this game borrows heavily from many titles from both cinema and gaming. This works to this games advantage in so many ways. This game really sucks you in to the point where you become totally absorbed and immersed in your surroundings.

The gameplay is excellent as there are many different functions that can be utilized using the controller. Anti-gravity is definitely a stand out feature on this game. There is nothing else like it out there. Combat is also a great feature that is made a lot of fun by using the dissecting feature. Enemies are hard to take down as they are fast and have thick skin. There are a few weapons to choose from and all have their pros and cons on individual enemy types. There are a few puzzles scattered about the game that make for a fun change of pace.

Graphics and sound on this title are some of the best to date. The main characters costume is truly an awesome sight to behold on the screen. The enemies are scary and disgusting which makes you want to kill them ASAP. A few reviews mention that the game gets predictable after awhile. Although you will get a sense of when an enemy is going to enter the scene due to a cue via scary music, you will still be jolted quite often as they don't always come from the same areas as some say. The music and sound effects are critical in making this game as great as it is.

The storyline is another plus. You are basically spending most of the game trying to get your ship up and running. This entails a lot of running around trying to perform various tasks while fending of the Necromorphs. This game was put together perfectly. I can tell that they spent a lot of time and effort on this game to make it the best they could. It paid off bigtime! I'm really impressed by this one. It keeps my interest whereas a lot of other games in the same genre can't even come close. It's hard to put the controller down on this one. It's truly a beautiful game in every aspect.

I have nothing negative regarding this game except that it would be nice to see another human being every now and then (that isn't dead) as this game has a very isolated and claustrophobic feel to it. Dead Space can make you feel a little jumpy right after you play it, especially at night. That's the power of a great survival horror title. It can really give you an adrenaline boost every now and then. Dead Space is probably only a half star lower than Fallout 3 and Bioshock imo.

The product installs a great game.  That being said, it also installs spyware/malware onto my computer.  This is the same type of software that I have paid programs to remove for years.  Why would a user want to install it deliberately onto their machine?

If you buy this product, know that one day it will cease to work.  I don't care if it is 6 months from now, or 10 years from now.

Newton,"First off, this game pokes fun at current ""metal"" trends while attempting to tell a story worthy of the 70s metal bands that meshed mythology and modern culture.  The game succeeds, in my opinion, in just about everything it sets out to do, and does it so well that it makes the endeavor of this mixed-genre game look natural and easy to accomplish.

You can't discuss this game without the tongue-in-cheek-yet-serious storyline.  The quirky characters and the fact that this is all being done in over-the-top fashion makes it hard to take seriously, but that hint of humor is what lends the game's story its sense of urgency.  If the game took itself seriously and didn't play these over-the-top characters for laughs, it would become tedious and overwrought.  The fact that they copped to their own camp value is what keeps it from being pretentious.

The game itself is actually a realization of Action games, Exploration/Free Roam games, and Real-Time Strategy.  Fans of one or two should have no problem with this game (though people who dislike RTS will find this game least agreeable as most major plot points revolve around RTS battles.)  You drive around the landscape in your upgradeable car, doing open-world missions and races.  If you upgrade your car for weapons, you can also shoot things instead of hopping out of the car to fight people (which, oddly enough, my axe kills things faster than lighting something on fire, shooting it with a chaingun, running it over, then backing up over it.)  Some of the missions will see you fighting things solo, but this is rare.  You will usually have minions helping you out (similar to Dynasty Warriors.)

Finally, the big thing is the RTS element.  While it couches it as a ""battle of the bands"" kind of rockshow, it is a serious (if a little bare-bones) strategy battle.  In true Rock-God fashion, you have to play some epic riffs and get your hands dirty leading your troops for the most part, and you can either fly around the battlefield or take your car (which is a bit of a disappointment, as stated above, for the damage it does compared to a few whacks with your axe.) to explore your options and set waypoints.  Each unit can also be ""teamed"" with to create a different or enhanced effect and, later, you can upgrade your main base and your basic units as well.

For all the wonderful setting and awesome music (which, admittedly, should appeal to anyone who is considering this game,) all the quirky characters and cool cinemas and events and so-on and so-forth ... the game is depressingly short (figure 8-10hrs at most for the core story.)  Like most free-roaming explorers, the game depends on your desire to ""catch 'em all!"" to keep you playing, either looking at all the cool setting or finding all the collectibles.  Admittedly, I'm interested in the fascinating metal-style mythology of this epic world, so I'm hunting for that now.

The game's brevity would seem to be an unfortunate decision to include RTS multiplayer in the game.  This has very little interest to me, and I would've much rather seen them incorporate the coding into additional story missions rather than saving it all for multiplayer (with no way to familiarize yourself with the other factions' units and abilities other than playing against a typical AI which substitutes higher resource and production rates for actual skill.)  I would have loved to, instead of playing multiplayer RTS, had to play a mission or three as the goth faction or the demon faction, especially because it would've fleshed out these adversaries just a little bit more and made it a little more satisfying to beat them.

Other minor gripes include the often-used mechanic of ""water is deadly,"" in that if you end up driving your car into the ocean or off a cliff, rather than just have a quick cinematic of your character crawling, annoyed, out of the surf, you go back to the last mission you accomplished after a brief death sequence.  Another minor issue is that I found it hard to give intricate commands to my troops (though I suppose that kind of fits given my troops.)  Also, re-used voice-clips during the missions and RTS tend to get a little old.

In all, this game is definitely a rental, but metalheads on a mission to relive the days of epic albums should probably pick this up ...","A ""Black Diamond"" in the Rough this one",1255737600,17,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Mindless fun, but a nice bonus that can border on obsession.

And....

I have to be honest...there is part of me that lives for this sort of over-the-top, plain and simple shoot 'em up with flair....plus throwing in bullet time, acrobatic sword fights, wall running, & angel dives(just to name a few....)never hurts. The upgrades and arcade-like tally system for style/kill points works well; much like Red Dead Revolver, you get a score at the end of each scenario, and points depending how well you did. You can repeat the level to get a better score if you want...and you will.

I was impressed how easily the controls flow once you get used to them; I can tell this will be a game worth repeating, as by the end of the first run, the controls will be second nature; then you can go thru it again and kick some serious butt. The controls do take a little getting used to, but eventually 2nd nature.

I found elements of some of my favorite games in here....both good ones and guilty pleasures; Bloodrayne(the heaviest influence to me in this game...), Total Overdose, The Club, Samurai Western, Killer 7, Max Payne, POP, Ninja Gaiden, & Stranglehold...just to name a few. Plus the whole 'grindouse' look is great; there are some pretty funny little cut scenes in between......

Somehow this works. Mindless but actually fun. And after coming off Fallout 3 for about 150 hours(sad, I know....), this is a welcome find.  Not for everyone, but def a grade A 'B Movie' style game....

I did hit one frustrating part: The training near the beginning that had the timed target shooting while running thing; it took me a while to learn some of the movements as far as running up against walls, jumps, etc....it was mildly annoying but proved beneficial in the end as you will be def well versed in Rubi's abilities....

Try the demo on xBox live or on the PS3......if you like it, the game is mostly more of the same.

3,True,"01 22, 2011",A3HN7D7HEQGM1R,B000ZK6950,Brendan Foy,"I realize this game has been reviewed to death here at Amazon but I figured I would add my own two cents considering I am not a regular fan of the series.  The only Resident Evil game I have played in the past was Resident Evil 2 and I never played the much accalimed Resident Evil 4 so I will not be comparing this game to that classic.  I will be judging Resident Evil 5 on itself alone and what it tries to be compared to what it ends up being.

First off, I played this game through on coop with a friend as it clearly was not designed with singleplayer in mind.  I will not comment much on singleplayer as my time with it was limited but thanks to the limited A.I. of Sheva, your partner, you spend a large chunk of your time babysitting her and monitoring her inventory instead of enjoying yourself.  It's perfectly playable on singleplayer, but this game was made for a cooperative experience.

Moving on to coop, Resident Evil 5 is a fun game with a friend.  It is not the best out there and suffers from some awkward game design decisions but you should have a good enough time playing through this game with a human partner.  During my playthrough I noticed that the game had a rather dated feel to it underneath the gorgeous coat of polish.  The graphics in this game are quite impressive, even in split screen coop.  The screen is split in a way where the top view is not directly above the bottom view, but where the top screen is to the left of the top portion of your tv and the bottom screen is to the right.  There is a blank black space to one side of each screen which I felt could have been used for U.I. data such as ammo count, health and the mini-map so none of this obstructs your view when playing the game.  The blank space is just a waste of space imo.

The characters are quite detailed, they look good, the enemies are just as impressive and the bosses can be a sight to behold.  The environments are just as meticulously detailed with some impressive lighting effects in certain levels but there is not nearly as much object interaction or environmental destruction as I would have liked (such as shooting out lights) and the level design is very linear.  Nice looking levels but I feel as if I am being pushed along from point A to B on a set and predetermined path which makes the levels feel much smaller and confined than they should.

The gameplay is where the mixed emotions come with this game.  Yes it is fun, but it seems as if it could have been much better had they just added in some basic controls that are commonplace today.  I never did quite get used to having to stop dead in my tracks to aim my weapon and fire, it's just awkward.  The game does not even allow the player to reload while on the movie, you have to come to a complete stop.  Stopping would be fine if it was to steady your aim but it would just make sense for the game to allow you to shoot, or at least reload, while on the move to provide for a more fluid gameplay experience.  There are also no evasive maneuvers in the game either which make the controls feel even more restrictive and there is no designated melee button, just a QTE option which appears if you stun an opponent with a gun shot.  This QTE driven melee I found to be unintuitive and a hassle.  The one move you have in the game to make your character more nimble is a side strafe, which is as basic as it gets, but at least it's still there.  You can sprint too, thankfully.

The aiming and shooting itself works just fine though.  It's a pretty old system, but I took pleasure in using it.  Challenging enough where you have to steady your aim to get that perfect shot but accessible enough where you don't waste too many bullets and suddenly find yourself out of ammo.  Shooting and killing is fun and the weapon selection is decent but nothing too special.  There are a couple special weapons in the game which are very cool to use but they can only be used in certain spots.

The sound of the weapons is a little underwhelming, particularly the shotgun which just didn't have the Boom I would expect it to have.  Environmental sound effects were much better and the voice acting was decent.  The story was forgettable, but perhaps that is because I'm not too familiar with the RE lore considering I only played one other game in the series.

The one game in the franchise I played before this, RE2, was true survival horror.  It scared the crap out of me in certain areas, I will never forget that room with the two way mirror where I just knew something would jump out of it, and eventually something did, as soon as I stopped expecting it.  That game got me everytime, it was an amazing experience.  I knew going in that Resident Evil 5 would be an action game so I will not take points off like some for it not being scary at all, but it's not a grade A action experience either.  It just isn't as good as other top quality, high octane shooters out there because of the restictive controls.  Even Dead Space, which is a much slower paced game that relies on horror more than action, felt more flexible with it's controls.  I just didn't see the reason to keep the constricted survival horror controls of the old days in what is now an all out, unapologetic action shooter.  It feels like this game has an identity crisis where it can't completely let go of the past, yet wants to evolve into something else.  Still definitely worth a look, I just hope the series finds itself in the next installment.

There is also a horde like Mercenaries mode at the end which I played for a bit but I am not too big a fan of these types of modes.

Pros:
- Graphics
- Boss Fights
- Coop Gameplay
- Fun Action

Cons:
- Gun Sounds
- Restictive Controls
- Convoluted Story with a predictable twist
- Frustrating Single Player thanks to bad partner A.I.

5,False,"08 13, 2009",A3OND36Q71G76D,B000ZK7ZOY,W. Scott Heitman,"The critical reception to Bionic Commando was anything but kind.  The PS3 version of the game is sitting on GameRankings with an aggregate score of 72%.  I've seen games get the short shrift before, but never so much as Bionic Commando.  I have a small confession to make;  I'm only halfway through the game, but I'm so enamored with it that I couldn't wait to write a review.  Here's the breakdown:

Graphics: Stunning throughout.  Animations seem realistic (considering the subject matter at least) and environments are breathtaking.  Not much to say because there's nothing to complain about.

Story:  I've heard that this aspect takes some criticism; apparently the ending is love it or hate it.  I'm enjoying the story partly because of the effective voice-acting.  Steve Blum always puts on a good performance, and he's effective here as Super-Joe.  I'm not familiar with the VA for the main character, but he certainly does a good job of making me believe he's enjoying the swinging as much as I am- which brings us to...

Gameplay:  There's nothing else on the market like BC.  It's not an FPS or even a standard 3rd person shooter.  The main focus is on effective use of the bionic arm.  The result has been compared to the Spider-man games, but such a comparison leaves out the nuances that BC brings to the table.  First of all, the level design is superb.  Whereas the Spider-man levels games are typically limited to swinging around the same old skyscrapers, BC's levels are filled with all kinds of broken buildings, suspended railways, caverns, and more.  Even if the mechanics of the swinging were identical, the game would play much differently.  But the swinging requires more precision than SM.  Some players make the mistake of giving the game five minutes and deciding it sucks.  It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using the arm, but once you've got it, you're in for some gameplay gold.  The reason the game ""works"", in my opinion, is that it doesn't focus on split-second reactions and near-impossible jumps.  Instead, the emphasis is on tactics.  How does one effectively navigate the war-torn landscape and attack ones' foes while evading their gun-fire?  Answering this question is the job of the player.  Using the arm, for instance, to swing into battle and then swing out to recover is a rewarding experience.  The boss battles, in particular, do a fantastic job of highlighting the difference between this game and your vanilla third person game.

Sound:  WOW!  If you're familiar with the themes from past BC games, you'll recognize some remixed themes.  This soundtrack, however, is simply outstanding.  From the elegant piano theme in the main menu to the thundering symphonic arrangements during battle, these pieces do much to elevate the gameplay to something truly special.  On a related note, I intend to do some serious searching for the sheet music to the menu music; I would love to play that on the piano.

Let's talk downsides for two seconds.  I've heard a lot of criticisms, and these are the two that I deem to be accurate:
1) Radioactive out-of-bounds.  Linear games have the difficult task of creating some means to provide limits to the environments.  The standard but laughable solution of times past has been the familiar ""invisible wall"".  BC tries something new by simply killing the player if they stray out-of-bounds for too long.  It is explained that much of the city is irradiated and that our protagonist must avoid this stuff like the plague.  Most of the time, this radiation is clear enough to see.  But those few times it surprises you can get pretty annoying.  This solution to an old problem might even be elegant if well-implemented, but there are some weird choices here.  Sometimes, the UPPER HALF of a building will be irradiated.  Usually, level limits are lateral in natural, so coming across this can be vexing.
2) Collectables.  See, you're gonna die a lot; this isn't an easy game (on Normal, at least).  Most games don't make you re-collect collectables if you die before reaching the next checkpoint.  Well, BC does.  Get used to it.

These cons are really quite minor in comparison to the fantastic gameplay on offer.  Every major aspect of BC screams high production values, and the gameplay offers something truly novel and rewarding.  The price of BC has plummeted in most places.  I found it new for 20 dollars.

--------------------------------------------------

I played a little of the PlayStation 2 version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game and LOVED it!  This is my quasi-review of the game taken from all of my hand-written notes.  Apologies if it's a little rough or a bit disjointed as I pretty much took it from my notes. In this review, I will be using ""PS2"" as shorthand for the PS2/Wii version (stylized), and ""PC"" as shorthand for the PC/PS3/X360 version (realistic).

The first thing I noticed when the game booted up is that the Loading screens are ridiculously long - at least 30 seconds or more.  One comes up just before the start-up logos, then another before every level. The PS2 cuts out a good part of the opening cinematic compared to the PC.  I'm sure they did it for disc space reasons, but it's still very disappointing and makes the opening feel hollow.  Gone are the ""glowing eyes"" shot (it adds to the creepiness of the scene), the shockwave, the Ecto-1, the opening cast credits (the main cast is at the top of the scrolling credits), and the theme song really (just as it kicks it, it stops cold).  If there's one positive to say about the PS2 opening, it's that when it cuts into the No Ghost logo on the screaming guard's face, it's an exact callback to the opening of Ghostbusters where the same setup is done with the screaming librarian.

The game starts off at a bunch of selection screens.  You can choose your difficulty, of course, but more importantly, you can choose the gender of the Rookie character.  The male model is a blonde surfer dude, while the female model is a cute brunette - kinda like Kylie from Extreme Ghostbusters without the Goth.  However, since the game uses the same audio assets as the PC, there are many times when the guys will call her a ""him"" or ""he"".  There are also various options you can change, including turning off the autosave feature.  I don't know why you'd want to do that as I didn't see any way for the player to manually save the game.  I would have preferred to be able to save anywhere, instead of only at the end of a level or if I made a change in the Options menu.

When the game proper starts, it places you in the firehouse.  If you've been following the game and the images from the PC version online, you'll immediate notice how sparse it is.  There are none of the little fan service easter eggs found in the PC version, other than the Vigo painting (not available right away) and the ability to slide down the two poles.  Heck, other than the general look of the place, it doesn't even have the same layout as the firehouse in the movies or The Real Ghostbusters.  I mean, the upstairs area is one little room, with NO beds!  Where does everyone sleep?

I have no problems with the character design and visual style.  Everything and everyone looks good for that style, but that's not to say that it's perfect.  If you look carefully, you'll notice that someone forgot to connect the Proton Pack to the Neutrona Wand.  Oops.  I also noticed two instances of flickering textures in the hotel level: a painting in the main lobby, and a ceiling panel when chasing after the angry chef.  An interesting little ""nuance"" of the game is that when not in ""action"" you can move the Ghostbusters around by pushing your character into theirs.

The controls work really well on the PS2.  After a few minutes, you'll get the hang of them and they become almost second nature; very intuitive.  Though it's very annoying not to have a run button.  What ISN'T so intuitive is the wrangling and trapping mechanic.  Once a ghost's energy has been depleted, you need to continue holding R2 (the fire button) to keep him in the stream (if you were also holding circle for the camera lock-on, you can let go of that), then flick the right analog stick in the direction of the on-screen arrows to slam the ghost around.  After a few slams, you'll get the final four-way arrows, so you can then slam the ghost in any direction.  Then you press triangle to get the trap out, and hopefully get the ghost quickly in the trap before he gets loose and you have to do the whole annoying slamming procedure again.  I much prefer being able to slam the ghost how I want, when I want, and where I want, like on the PC.

The game retains the PKE Meter scanning feature of the PC version, but there's DOUBLE the amount of entities to scan - including some people!  The on-screen crosshair gains a circle when it's over something that can be scanned.  Green if you need to scan it, white if you already did.  There's over 100 Tobin's Spirit Guide entries, which are split into two collectibles: scans and art pages.  You perform the scan to get the data on the entity, and you collect the art page to get the picture of the entity.  A word to the wise: be sure to scan everything, then destroy everything.  You never know what items have Tobin's Spirit Guide entries, or what objects are hiding art pages inside them. Also, items in the Help & Tobin's Guide menus blink until you've viewed them once, and the Pause menu will dim is kept on screen too long.  I guess this is to help prevent burn-in on your TV screen, so it's a good thing (it brightens up again as soon as you push any button).

One piece of equipment that isn't retained is the Slime Tether.  Slime Mines replace the Slime Tether as the Slime Blower's secondary fire mode.  That's kinda disappointing as I wanted to give the Slime Tether a trial run, but I guess that the PS2/Wii hardware couldn't support the Slime Tether.  The Meson Collider and it's secondary mode, the Overload Pulse, are both eliminated entirely from the PS2 as well.  Also, the health and pack overhead meters are on the on-screen HUD, not on the pack like in the PC.

The controller vibrates (rumbles) when you overheat, so if you don't keep an eye on your overheat meter, the controller will let you know.  I was expecting, and hoping, that the rumble would have been used instead for when you're firing your proton pack.  You know, to make it feel like there's some kickback from the weapon...ahhh, piece of equipment.

Going into the first level (the Hotel Sedgewick), Peter is telling everyone to try to look highly trained, but his lips aren't moving at all.  I noticed a few cutscenes like this, and I've only played the first three levels so far.  This shouldn't have made it into the final product.  Heck, bad lip sync is better than no lip sync.  Almost all of the cutscenes are rendered using the in-game engine.  Only four of them are pre-rendered video files.  I'm guessing that since the player can choose the model of the Rookie character, this was probably the only way to do it.  The Rookie doesn't appear in any of these four cutscenes.  Video files, including the pre-rendered cutscenes, have this interference in them that doesn't happen at any other time.  I first noticed it during the start-up logos.  Also, when an in-game cutscene appears, no matter where in the area you and the guys were when it started, you'll be moved to where the cutscene wants you to be.

There were a few instances of unrealistic behavior from the Ghostbusters.  One example is when I was charged with zapping and trapping Slimer in the ballroom, while Peter stood in the background doing nothing.  I understand he wants me to do it all by myself; and if he did take control, there'd be nothing for me to do (the game would play itself); but it just seems totally unrealistic for him to just stand there not doing a darn thing.  The least he could do is help.

What are probably large, whole levels on the PC are broken up into smaller levels on the PS2.  For example, your first trip to the Sedgewick is three levels on the PS2, in between each is one of those long loading screens.  Damaged objects from one level will be restored in the next level, if both levels take place in the same place and time - such as the first three levels in the Hotel Sedgewick.  But let me tell you... the environments are oh-so-destructible.  Probably not as much as in the PC due to their being less objects, but its still very fun to destroy everything.  Even duct work on the ceiling in the kitchen is destructible.  Heck, even the tiny little ball lights hanging from the ceiling in the kitchen can be destroyed.

You can quit the current level and go back to the firehouse at any time, but you'd lose your progress in the level.  It would have been nice if they gave this option in between levels - you know, after it saved your progress, and BEFORE you wait 30 seconds or more for the next level to load.  When you go back to the firehouse, you'll have access to things that you didn't when you started off there.  You can view the credits (second floor, cabinets next to far pole), replay completed levels (second floor, television), talk to Vigo (basement, no interact circle appears near him, but pressing X makes him chatty), view the actual Tobin's Spirit Guide book (basement), and collect two art pages (both in the basement).  This is in addition to sliding down the two poles, going to the lockers for profile maintenance, or going to Ecto-1 to start the next mission.  The background music in the firehouse repeats WAY too often, but I like the animation of Peter behind his desk, which at one point had him leaning on his Neutrona Wand.  The text in the Tobin's Spirit Guide book should have been made darker, so it's easier to read, and it had entries for things I hadn't seen yet (possible glitch?).  Another firehouse glitch: Go up to the Slimer cage, then walk backwards from it and you'll hear the ""interact"" sound effect.  On rare occasions, the ""View Tobin's Spirit Guide"" graphic will pop up for a split second in the lower right corner.

There's no split-screen multiplayer on the PS2, only on the Wii.  This is a single-player only game.  That's sad because the PS2 can do local split-screen multiplayer, and even online multiplayer.  I don't see why this had to be cut out.  Also, the PS2 save icon is a big black cube with the box art on it.  I'm disappointed, as I was hoping that it would have been a 3-D representation of the No Ghost logo.

Although at times the stylized game feels rather hollow compared to the realistic game, it's not really fair to compare them like that.  The way to look at the two versions is like two different directors making two different movies of the same story/source material in two different styles.  It's as if Sam Raimi and John Lasseter both decided to make their own version of Ghostbusters.  Each has some similar story elements, and each has unique story elements.  You need to play both versions of the game to get the complete experience.

And that's my overall impressions and notes about the PlayStation 2 version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game based on my playing of the first three levels.  The stylized version may not be as cool as the big, bad realistic version, but it's a worthy addition to the franchise and leaps and bounds better than all of the other Ghostbusters video games that have come out in the past twenty-five years.","We Came, We Saw, We...Wait, Where's Multiplayer?",1247184000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation2'}",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IY5Ik67FL._SY88.jpg']

Ghostbuster fall down, I leave him down.  If you enjoy a video game version of the Medical Alert braclet commerical, Ghostbusters: The Game is for you!

Besides the repetitive gameplay (you are either shooting ghosts with 1 of 4 weapons, or shooting ghosts and trapping them), the unendurable load times in between deaths (10 seconds, at least), and the puzzles (that aren't brain busters but sometimes take forever because the objects aren't rendered well), what I've found most irritating is the glitches.  I've had to restart several checkpoints because of in-game errors and if you think Peter Venkman gets irritated with Ray sometimes, you haven't seen me having to replay a 15 minute ghost shootout when I was deathly bored the first time.  There are way too many flaws in this game for anyone to pay actual money for it.  Ghost money, maybe.

3 notable examples of errors I enjoyed:  I could not leave the kitchen after killing all of the ghosts because the game didn't register it (the Ghostbusters have to say ""all clear,"" but never did), and in the graveyard a ghost got stuck in a tree on the other side of a wall, so I couldn't trap it and therefore could not advance.  Strange, but no, gentle reader when something is strange in your neighborhood you don't call the Ghostbusters.  You call the nearest resell shop and ask how much they are giving for a used copy of this game.

And the third example, something that actually made me spit:  when you get knocked down, it will happen quite often that the other Ghostbusters, if any of them are standing right next to you, will run away instead of picking you up.  As he returns, he's knocked down and you fail the mission.  That means you have to watch and listen to the same scene, sometimes 20-30 times, depending on the difficulty level.  Fun?  No. Not fun.

What I'd recommend is renting it for a friend and watching them suffer playing it.  Whenever there is a cut scene, ask the victim to call you back in the room so you can watch.  You'll save yourself money, you'll safe yourself grief, you may lose a friend ... so, make sure you invite a so-so friend.","Good for the Story, Bad for the gameplay",1250640000,6,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

If you thought the graphics for Uncharted II was great, wait until you see GOW III. Character models are amazing, environment designs dazzling, texture superb, and the lighting effects are illuminating.

GOW III starts off exactly where GOW II ended, with Kratos on the back of Gaia scaling Mt. Olympus. And just like GOW II starts off with an epic boss battle, just this time it's bigger and more brutal. If the first boss battle is any indication of how the game will play it's that GOW III is bigger, badder, and more extreme. As it should be, because Kratos is after the King of Gods and if he has to go through all the other Olympians so be it.

The mechanics in GOW III is literally the same as the previous titles. Combos are handled the same way as well as movement, upgrades, and items collection. There are a few enhancements though, Kratos can now latch onto enemies to be carried or rush straight into them after. He can also grab enemies and use them as battering rams, or throw them, and climb on cyclops and hounds to attack other creatures. Secondary weapons such as your bow has its own meter no longer shared with the magic gauge. Also, the QTE buttons are now located on the screen based on their layout on the controller instead of just in the middle of the screen. For example, now the triangle QTE button will show up on the middle top of the screen, circle on the middle right, etc, etc.

There are new items to collect for replay value similar to the jars in GOW II, and new weapons to enhance. Unfortunately among all the weapons, the Cetus Gauntlets are the only one that plays differently from the blades. Not much weapons variety compared to GOW II's spear and hammer.

As far as the story goes, this is the final installment to Kratos's story and I honestly believe that it's a fitting end to this Greek tragedy. The themes of the first and second game carry through into the third and befits the final end.

Players who enjoy the first and second game will no doubt enjoy the third also. It is not entirely perfect, there moments in the game that doesn't equate to the beginning.

I've been playing video games since 1997. SC 1 is definitely one of the best pc games of all time. However, I feel deeply disappointed by SC 2 after waiting for over a decade and reading so many reviews before and on July 27th.
So I decided not to purchase this game, not because the game itself is not good or whatsoever, but because I cannot feel the essences that a good game should possess: passion and quality.
As others said, this game was created for profit ONLY.
It's such a shame that Blizzard ignores the gamers community who supported SC 1 and waited for so many years. It's even a greater shame that Blizzard used the gamers community's love and memories with SC 1 as tools for their greed.

Some may give a 5 star rating. I suspect they are younger gamers who joined the community after the era of SC 1, so they may not care what SC 1 is like, and they don't necessarily have expectations for SC 2 as we might have. To them, SC 2 is just another pc game coming out this summer. As I said, the gameplay itself may not be bad after all.

Main Points

Good
-Story is dynamic and multi-faceted
-Definitely has the scare factor
-Extras really help explain the world of Bright Falls

Bad
-General mechanics could use some tweaking
-Later weapons are sometimes less effective than initial ones
-Graphics are barely average and in cases quite bad
-Despite the dozens of cutscenes, story is hard to follow
-Repetitive gameplay defeats almost any fun factor

Gameplay and Combat 5 of 10
In a world of FPS Alan Wake stands out as a deviation to the norm. In the world of Alan wake you are a famous writer reminiscent of a Stephen King novel. And the game is setup to appear like a movie. You'll be spending the majority of your time running through the woods. No; take that back. You'll spend 80% of the time running or driving through the woods. The repetition is punctuated by collectables which are manuscript pages or these coffee thermoses that you find lying around the forest. They contain pieces of the story. While in the woods you'll be fighting things called ""The Taken."" These are dark entities that are some sort of possessed townsfolk brought to life by this Darkness that resides in Cauldron Lake. The Taken are turned away only by light and this is also the only thing that heals you.

It's difficult to describe the combat without making it sound utterly boring. You fight small groups of Taken usually 3-6 at a time. To keep them away from you, you HAVE to have the light shining on the particular person and usually make it ""focus"" to maybe burn out their retinas or something. And if you stay too preoccupied with one, another will come up behind you and hit you in the back with an axe. It only takes three solid hits to kill you, so you have to be quick. But, if you've played any shooters, the learning curve should be pretty short. Otherwise, there are a decent amount of weapons, but they don't really progress all that much. Your main weapons are: revolver, shotgun (almost worthless), pump shotgun and hunting rifle in the way of firearms. And then occasionally you're given a flare gun which takes out a bunch of enemies all at once, same thing with the flashbang grenades.

Other than that there really aren't any other true weapons. It's not that you can't get by with them; it's that they get so flippin' boring to use. The revolver is the only good all-around weapon. The other ones don't seem to be any stronger and they take far longer to reload and shoot. There's almost no progression and absolutely no balance. Worst of all, there are only two human enemies - big guys and little guys. Then sometimes these large groups of ravens will attack you.

Graphics 5 of 10
People look quite good in Alan Wake; faces are very detailed have a decent human quality to them as well as the majority of the animation. But the forest looks so sub-par it's hard to discount. Trees are 3-D and there are shrubs and grass blades, but that's about where the next gen visuals stop. Everything just looks so pixelated. Textures resemble a polished PS2 game and remember you'll be spending the vast majority of your time in the forest.

Story 6 of 10
When I think about horror games of the past, Resident Evil, Silent Hill and so on come to mind. They gave me a compulsion to want to find out what's going to happen. With Alan Wake I find myself getting the scare and stress factor but find it difficult to care what's going on. And it was even harder to finish. The characters are either too boring or to ostentatious. And I personally couldn't relate to Wake whatsoever. He's a whiny writer who picked a backwoods town to take a vacation in. Then he gets annoyed by anyone who mentions that they're a fan. What did he expect? The other characters aside from the main antagonist are forgettable. In terms of game stories it's actually pretty solid. There is a plot with well-defined characters, intrigue, mystery and background in terms of the manuscripts you pick up along the way. But as I said before, it's a story based game so it has to rely on the story because the real gaming part is going to be lackluster. Maybe I just find the whole idea of a ""horror game"" a bad idea.

Replay Value and Difficulty 4 of 10
Replaying Alan Wake even with DLC is not likely for myself. The game is probably worth $30 at best. The main reason is I find almost no reason to do so. The manuscript pages offer a deeper dive into the story of Alan Wake, but are written in the narrative of Wake's poetic license so these are less factual than they are a different look at what's already happening in the game. The game is quite difficult even on what they call normal. This is how I first play a game is usually on its lowest difficulty to get the mechanics down and understand how they really programmed the game. So for casual gamers this would be quite off-putting. For people who want a real challenge, it's perfect. Gameplay tops out at about 15 hours, which I was actually happy about; as I said before at $30 you're pushing the value limit.

Conclusion
Alan Wake is a game which takes a risk on a bold new gaming experience, melding the King-esque storytelling with the third person shooter. And it works ok, that is the issue with everything. It's all just ok. There's nothing inspiring or fun about the game if you're not totally into the genre or you find this particular story very appealing. Would I rent or buy? I'd definitely rent to see if you like it, but I'd be hard pressed to tell anyone to buy this without a trial period.","Average, Flawed and Hardly Worth Playing",1296518400,,,

This game for Wii is a port from the other systems and developers did not go over it very well.

Constant system crashes.  9th inning of the World Series, game 7, doesn't matter, game crashes when you come up to bat. Or at other weird times.

Memory errors (it will lose your saved game, so you will have to copy it to an SD card, then copy it back to get it to work).

Franchise mode.... after the first season enjoy playing only 8-10 games per season after that, there's a huge bug that does not allow you to play more than 10 games in a season after the first.

Games that end in rain will have to be totally replayed due the the game not realizing it was over 6+ innings long

5,True,"10 3, 2011",AJN24TVEGZEI4,B00127VDWY,Steve,"This game is a phenomenal, well crafted, brilliantly designed racing game for the PSP and is my favorite racing game on the PSP.  I should note that I also own and have reviewed WipeOut Pure as well, and I absolutely hated it for all the reasons that Pulse improved on.

Game Play (5/5):  In my opinion this game is one of the most fun racing games available on the PSP, additionally, the game is addictive and will keep you attached for hours.  The game definitely has a VERY steep learning curve, is very hard to get the hang of and can definitely be ridiculously hard and exceptionally frustrating.  If you have read my critique of Pure, you will know that I hated that game for an almost unending amount of reasons, all of which for me made the game unnecessarily difficult and took away the fun from the game, this game improved on all of that and made the game a real blast.

In my opinion, this game is a vast improvement over Pure for the following reasons.  My first complaint in Pure is that the tracks were so narrow and hard to navigate... In this game the track is wider, easier to navigate and give you far more wiggle room to battle other ships. My second issue with pure  was that of all the weapons that were available the enemy always got the missiles and stuff and you always got stuck with the shield.  Not is Pulse.. In pulse the enemy is loaded to the teeth with weapons and thankfully so are you!  My last complaint about Pure was the difficulty from the beginning.  Pulse is a lot more accessible to gamers like myself than Pure is and starts out a lot easier.  Also, Pulse adds all kind of great modes, my favorite being an elimination mode which lets you battle other crafts... AWSOMENESS!  Additionally, the graphics in Pure were awesome to begin with, but they were greatly improved with explosions being better, combat being more awesome and colors being far more brighter.

Graphics (5/5):  Much like Wipeout Pure, Pulse is brilliantly crafted, and has crisp, clean, flawless graphics.  The ships are magnificently designed, look really cool and have every balance of armor, speed, and handling that you could possibly imagine.  One of my complaints with Pure is that the track slowly rolls by you as if your ship is going 2 mph.  This game vastly improved that graphic, allowing the track to wiz by and truly give the impression of a high-speed race.  The worlds and tracks in this game are of such a high degree that they are awe inspiring and are as imaginative and perfectly crafted as you can possibly get.

Controls (5/5):  The controls are exactly the same as Pure and are perfectly aligned to give the best use of the PSP unit.  Generally the top left and right buttons are for the air brakes which I absolutely hate, thankfully both Pulse and Pure give you the option of using only a single air brake which I find much more enjoyable.  While some games can have clunky, awkward controls, this is not one of those games, the controls are fluid, and easy to learn and use.

Sound (5/5): There is a pretty good sound track to this game.  Truthfully between Pulse and Pure, I like Pure's sound track better, but I love that this game allows you to make you own custom soundtracks.

Extras (5/5):  The game has a ton of extras.  In addition to the tons of unlockable ships, tracks and modes, you can also design your own ship, design your own races, and download all kinds of goodies from the game's website which his completely accessible from the  game's main menu itself.

In essence this game is a great buy.  It is far better than Pure, has far more options, modes, combat and extras.  This game is an improvement in every way over WipeOut Pure and you should definitely buy this game.  I love this game and I think you will too.

**Note,load times take forever.  This is the only thing about this game that sucks**

***Just a warning for casual gamers like myself, this game is super difficult, the game starts very hard, and get punishingly difficult as the races get faster and as you unlock new areas.

It takes place, I think, in the future where an alien race has assaulted planet Earth.  Apparently they have the ability to make people into their race, or something.  I don't really know, as the plot is very uninteresting and mostly inconsequential.  You play some guy, a ""Sentinel"", which means something special, but I don't know what.  As you can tell I didn't play the first one, so maybe this is all stuff I should already know.  Regardless, it all seems very generic and super thin on plot.  I have not played in multi-player, as I have no interest.  Apparently this is where the game shines, or so I'm told.  I'll never know because it is unlikely I'll ever put it back in the tray.

The environments are pretty stunning in some places, the graphics pretty good, and the sound very rich.  The gun variety is lacking...  most of the time you will have the same weapon, or whatever weapon you have ammo for.  Since you can only carry two weapons at a time you'll be forced to dump weapons in trade for whatever you can find that has ammo.  Apparently this passes as strategy.

There have definitely been a few fun parts, here and there.  Some parts where the chaos of battle is thick and you are running around, immersed.  Most of the time the game involves cheap one-hit kills or times of nothing followed by a massive wave of enemies.  Rinse, dry, repeat.  While there is variety in enemies, there isn't much variety in game play.  Yes, the game hits all the standard FPS style levels:  Open space with big combat, open space with big bad guy, enclosed space with low lights and is kind of spooky, enclosed space with lots of bad guys, one on one ""big boss"" battles, desolate towns, and alien spaceships.  All very generic.

My biggest complaint with the game is that it devolves into ""Serious Sam"" style game play.  You'll, essentially, round the corner to find a gigantic pile of bad guys who want nothing more than to kick-start your face with their massive arsenal of weaponry.  You'll do lots of running in circles trying to track and kill waves of spidery things, packs of flying drones, waves of zombie-like-rip-off things, and big dudes with player-seeking missiles.  It gets old, and in my opinion is the mark of poor level design.  Checkpoint, walk a bit, massive swam of bad guys, checkpoint.

I'm not entirely sure what I expected when I got this game, but I was certainly surprised at the poor quality of this game.  Graphics only go so far, and a good concept isn't worth anything if it is executed poorly.  Resistance 2 wouldn't be a bad rental, or even on discount -- but at full pop, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth.","Uncreative, repetative, waves of enemies and lame run and gun",1242345600,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This game keeps the spirit of the old and super awsom SF2 and SF2 turbo many of us loved and got hooked on when we were kids. Over 20 charachters, great movement and game speed, and some new stuff that add up to the experience.

There are some very minor things to critique though. The background worlds don't excell in graphics, even if they're 3D.

RE4 set a new standard for the survivor-horror genre and resurrected the Resident Evil franchise. Does RE5 try to be just as ground-breaking as RE4? No, RE5 instead tries to simulate and perfect the RE4 experience by incorporating a number of changes.

The biggest change is that this game is on the next generation (or should I say current generation) of consoles. The graphics are some of the best the 360 and PS3 currently have to offer. Of course, the wonderful graphics are almost a given considering a company with high production values such as Capcom developing a game on the next generation consoles. The real changes are the ones made to the gameplay.

The first major gameplay change is the co-op focus. Our hero Chris Redfield is paired up with sidekick Sheva at all times in the game. Having another armed person always by your side definitely take away the thrill factor that was present in RE4, but it makes this Resident Evil fun in another sort of way. When playing alone (such as I did) your partner Sheva is controlled by the AI. The AI is hard to describe. Most of the time it operates perfectly. Sheva seemed to have perfect aim with the rifle I gave her and definitely saved me from death more than once. However, there are certain points in the game when the AI poorly handles the situation at hand. Worst of all, these are points were you cannot just take matters into your own hand. Chris and Sheva are sometimes required to split up and if Sheva can't handle her own, there's little you can do to alleviate the problem. Fortunately, this problem only comes into play if you are playing alone. If you plan to play with another person, these situations won't show up.

The other game play change is the changes made to the inventory system. Compared to RE4's attache case system, RE5's is both a step forward and a step backward. The good news is that you no longer have to pause the game in the heat of the action to switch weapons or pick up ammo. You can assign your various guns and what have you to the four directions on the d-pad. Rather than pausing and scrolling through the menu to select your gun, just push up on the d-pad and out comes your weapon. There are other slots in your inventory for ammo and curatives that can be chosen by holding triangle (or Y on the 360 I'd assume) This too does not break up the in-game action. The problem with this system is that you only get an un-upgradeable 9 slots of inventory. Sure you had to manage space in RE4's attache case, but at least that system was fair. Here, one item can go in each slot, be it a gun, an herb, or an egg. Yes, an egg takes up just as much space as a gun. It's quite frustrating when your full inventory makes it unable for you to pick up a red herb, because the only destiny a red herb has is to be combined with a green herb, but before you can do that they both have to have their own slot in the inventory. You have to manage Sheva's inventory if you're playing alone, dictating what guns and ammo she'll be getting or not getting. You can request any item she may have for yourself, so the whole item management between the two of you isn't a total conundrum.

I can't say for you if the plot is better than that in RE4, but I can say that it is much more related to past Resident Evils than RE4's was. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the player.

In conclusion, there's no reason somebody who was pleased with RE4 wouldn't be pleased (if not more) by RE5. It has everything that made RE4 great along with new features and that next-gen flair to keep things fresh.",A worthy succesor to Resident Evil 4?,1247875200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I don't know how else to introduce this game to anyone who hasn't seen or played it yet, except to say that of all the games in my collection this has been overall the most addicting game I've ever purchased.  Spending $60 for a PS3 game is always kind of a stretch for me at times, however after playing 45 hours and completing only 35% of the game to date, I can't think of any other game where I can say ""I definitely got my moneys worth"" besides this one.

First of all, there's not much new information I can share that hasn't been mentioned in other reviews but I will give my review on what I have observed in my experience playing the game.  I will say that it compares similarly to games like Fallout 3, Far Cry 2 and GTA4 more than any other game I've played, but also with several similarities to games like Uncharted and InFamous.  Those are the only games I have played/own to compare it to, so there may be more.  If you like/enjoy any of those games, then you will LOVE Just Cause 2.

As I said earlier - 45 hours played and only 35% complete. Not a minute of that time spent felt wasted or boring.  Needless to say, the world in this game is just massive and SO much fun to explore!  The people involved with putting this game together - I applaud you for the detail you put into every single pixel.  This is the kind of game that as a kid growing up, I always dreamed of having.  Not that it's got everything I ever wanted in a single video game, but breaking out of that linear gameplay completely is exactly what this game is.

Compared it to the GTA series, although the side missions and sandbox style IS similar, the one key that makes Just Cause 2 immediately better is that you can go anywhere and do anything right off the bat.  (You do start with a mission, but afterwards you can get in the plane and fly all over the island, which is what I did.) In GTA4, no matter how big the city was or how many places there were to explore, you had to unlock levels that weren't until many hours into the game, just to get across a bride that was blocked by a police barricade.  Although there are constantly military forces trying to kill you in JC2, it's not nearly as annoying as the instant 4-star wanted level that would automatically appear if you ever tried to get out of the part of the city you were blocked into in GTA4.

What I really appreciate about this game is that it forces you to explore every square meter of the island to discover every faction item, armor upgrades, weapon/vehicle parts, cash stashes, etc.  There are smaller islands and places on the main islands that are unmarked and non-discoverable areas that include power-up stashes and easter eggs which is what helps make this game SO much fun to walk around and explore.  You might spend a while in a plane, on a boat or on foot just looking around...  but when you find a stash or one of the several easter eggs (LOST hatch, hot air balloon, et al) the time it took was totally worth the wait. It all makes it THAT much more of a feeling of accomplishment, unless you went online to find the exact coordinates of those places.  I decided to just play the game and discover whatever I can on my own.

Something else that I absolutely LOVE about the game is that it has the perfect balance between reality and fiction with the physics for a sandbox video game.  You get some of the best graphics and detail in a game that I have ever seen.  The way the trees swirl and blow in the wind when the helicopter hovers/flies above.  Swimming underwater looks and feels about as real as any game I've played.  As the game developers were very specific in making sure there was realism in the places it would be most noticed and/or appreciated, they did a superb job adjusting the physics and game reality to make the most of the gameplay and all of the fun and interesting things you are free to do in the game, such as stunt jump on the top of a plane flying at 10,000 ft without falling off, or having unlimited parachutes to use while you are skydiving/base jumping.  The fact that you can pretty much fly through trees (except the trunk) while parachuting is one of the many things that keeps this game on the ""I love this game"" side of the line rather than the ""gosh, this game is frustrating"" side.  If you can imagine if it were realistic in every way, parachuting into and through trees would get you caught and stuck in them.  Being able to cruise right through them is just one of the many fictional aspects of the gameplay that I actually appreciate.

Since I'm an avid MW2 player, another non-realistic detail the developers included in this game is the aiming and shooting of weapons.  If you have the sniper rifle and look down the scope, you don't get any shakiness or movement and you can pick off people a hundred meters away with no effort.  (that helps when going for the headshots trophy).  Most any other gun, you can almost walk through and point in the general direction of the military guys and blow them away.  Might seem too easy, but when there are thousands of these guys you have to kill, it helps to not have to try so hard to kill them.  (again, the difference between ""Fun"" and ""Frustrating"".  And speaking of weapons, the fact that you can detach any mounted gun, having unlimited ammo and walk around with it destroying anything that gets in your way, you truly are a one-man army!  Just the fact that you have unlimited ammo in all of the vehicles is another fictional aspect of the game and also brilliantly executed by the developers to keep this on the fun and playable side.

The game does actually have a story too. :)  But that's not really the best part of the game or the focus.  I sort of accidentally finished the game much sooner than I expected (only 7 Agency missions) and I wish I would have played more Faction missions or saved more parts/money to upgrade my weapons. But that doesn't detract from the game much at all.  Once you beat the game, you are then in Mercenary mode, which still allows you to do any of the missions and explore all you want.  The story is too short, in my opinion, and possibly too easy.  But like I said, I don't feel that it's all that important, but the last 3 missions are pretty awesome!

Although I have given the game 5/5 stars, had the rating system been out of 100, I would have to give it a 97/100.  It's not perfect by any means, but after all those hours playing the game, there are a few key things that really bother me about the game.

1) no hand-to-hand combat.  This is not all THAT bad, but if you run around the corner and suddenly there's a military guy there ready to shoot you, there's no way to punch or knife the guy.  Yeah, you have the grapple melee, but that's somewhat weak depending on the position you're in.  I kinda wish I could knife or punch someone when up close, but they clearly made this a shooting-intensive game rather than hand to hand. (My wish is that it was similar to the style of the Uncharted series...  that would be the perfect comparison.)

2) Rico can grapple, hang, fly/drive any vehicle, swim, base jump and skydive - but he can't jump/climb over a simple wall that is no higher than his chest.  This is the one and ONLY frustrating part of the game for me.  I really don't understand the fact that Rico can do just about anything and everything, but if he comes up to a wall that is slightly higher than his jump, he can't get over it unless you grapple to a building and pull yourself over.  I think this is one MAJOR flaw on the part of the developers, where they go from completely open world and seamless gameplay to the physics of a mario brothers game.  I hate to compare games again, but this is where I wish you could do something similar to what Drake can do in Uncharted.  If Rico could just jump and pull himself over a ledge or a wall, that would make SO many things easier and smoother to play through...  but that's just me being VERY picky. :)

I think the controls are quite easy to get the hang of.  Sometimes I would get caught up thinking I'm playing MW2 and press L1 to aim, but instead I grapple across the map unintentionally. :)  I don't do that much anymore though.

With that said, after beating the games I sold them. But never bought the later releases such as ""MGS2:Substance"" and ""MGS3:Subsistence"", so just finding out that this collection was coming out by Konami has made me ecstatic to play these great games again and I was guaranteed that I'd get my money's worth.

I haven't played MGS3 in 3 years, since the day it was released in '04, and same with MGS1 and 2 which was a long time ago. They're still the great games I've remembered them to be. If you've kept up in the gaming world, you've heard critical acclaim of these 3 stellar games, and if this is your first time playing MGS and want to backtrack from MGS1 to keep up with the story to follow the upcoming MGS4 installment, then this is a no-brainer to BUY THIS!

There are a few things I dislike about this package and didn't know why in the heck Konami couldn't include. Like another reviewer has said, the MGS3: Subsistence is an incomplete package without the second disc and why couldn't they fix the memory card issue on MGS1? Not only can't we save games if we don't have a original PS1 memory card, but you literally can't find these in stores anymore! Unless you go on eBay. But if you own a PS3 or have a PS1 Memory Card already this just proves you're lucky. With that said, this makes this Essential Collection a bit flawed.

Pros:
- All three MGS's in one package at a great price.
- Two of them being the ""Director's Cut""
- The original MGS on original 'black disc' PSone discs. A rarity to see since they haven't made these in a while.

Cons:
- MGS1 not save compatible with a PS2 Memory Card.
- The second disc for MGS3:Subsistence is missing.

In my opinion, Wall-E is a special kind of movie that almost anyone can sit down and enjoy if they allow themselves to.
That being said, when we picked up a copy of Wall-E the video game we weren't expecting a mind-blowing, revolutionary gaming experience. We just wanted to have some laid-back fun zipping around the decks of the Axiom causing mischief, and that's exactly what we got. I'm not sure why some people review this game as if they were expecting the next Bioshock or Fallout. The price tag and style of Wall-E liken it more to an X-Box Live Arcade game, and when viewed in  that light, Wall-E is a really good game.
What's really important is that Wall-E the video game has preserved the heart and personality of Wall-E the movie. Much like the way I felt about Ghostbusters the video game, you can nitpick the gameplay all you want, it may not be perfect but doesn't the feeling of being in a familiar and beloved world overshadow those shortcomings?

I am a HUGE fan of all bioware games, especially Knights of the Old Republic, which I consider the best RPG of all time to date and was looking forward to this game as a ""spiritual successor"" to KotOR. (compared to KOTOR2 which was a big pile of rubbish. Thats what you get when you don't let bioware make the sequel)

First off, the game is great, however it's not as good as KotOR was. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game but doesn't live up to KotOR.

Pros: Storyline - I personally liked the mass effect storyline better than KotOR in some respects. It feels a little more real/gritty and I feel more suspense from the enemies than I ever did with the baddies from KOTOR. You also have the option to read all about the different species throughout the game as you collect information on them, also the tech of the universe and history. Very well done Bioware, I like the depth here.

Gameplay - The gameplay is fun too. I don't know why some people don't like it. The shooting is fun and being able to hide behind and shoot is a welcome to just standing there and taking it ala KOTOR.

Voice Acting - The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard in a game. Some of it's very moving in certain areas. They actually have Seth Green as the pilot of your ship and he does an awesome job. He was one of my favorite characters in the game and I hope he comes back for ME2.

Cons:

Side-Missions - The side missions are interesting for the first couple of times but then they all turn into the same thing. You basically have to land on a planet and roll around in a horribly hard to steer buggy and find a place where you have to kill or talk to someone. There are only a couple of maps for these that are overused. The side quests themselves seem like more work than fun.

Characters - While the characters are fun and interesting. There is NOT enough back story to them. I will try not to spoil anything, but something big happens between your character and another after only like 4 conversations. What?! I remember having tons more conversations with my companions from KotOR than this. It felt like I hardly knew the Mass Effect characters at the end of this game. Very saddened by this because they were interesting.

Inventory and HUD - The inventory system sucks. That's all there is to it. You can't look at your inventory easily at all. And god help you if you ever get to your max limit of items on a mission. The game REQUIRES you to start trashing new items if your over your limit. And you can't check your team mates levels or items most of the time. When your on your ship you might as well forget about tweaking there powers and items. It's impossible.

Other thoughts: To the person who said the game is grainy. Yes, I found this out as soon as I started it and was SHOCKED that it looked so bad. HOWEVER, there is a option that gets turn on automatically as default in the game (god why?!) that makes it look more grainy. It's suppose to cause the game to be more ""movie like"" but just makes it ugly imo. Turning it off makes it look a LOT better and I was very happy with the graphics after that.

First, as another reviewer noted there dosen't seem to be any strategic difference made with tatical wins or losses.  That is you can't change history.  This game could have been a classic if that had been included. 2nd, as my title states the programers of this game really love AT and ART.  I played two full battles as the Germans.  One against the Poland and one against France and both on the easiest setting.  Those Polish 45mm AT guns and the French 75mm field Art just chewed up the Pz I and IIs.  There was no way I could knock out either one on one. That is with everything being equal, lets say on flat ground and level elevation at 500 yds and both facing forward.  The Polish AT or French Art would win that duel 8 of 10 times in this game.  That is unrealistic. Now, I am not stating that neither of these guns couldn't penetrate the relative thin armor of any early war tank, but most kills would come from ambush and/or from side rear.  Also AT and ART are soft targets with thin gun shields.  I watched as a PZ 38(t) lobbed HE rounds that exploded on the shield or within 2-3 feet(both in front and in back) of the crew with no effect.  The gun crew was literaly walking in the blackened shell holes.  Then low and behold the Pz 38(t) was a burning wreck.  One of my favorite vehicles of WWII is the Panzerjager I.  I just like the way it looks and how it came into being.  But it did not offer very good protection for the crew and this is tracked tank detroyer and relatively hard.(compared to AT guns and ART)  The crews stated when HE shells burst nearby the thin armor was penetrated.  It's just frustrating.  I supposed when I get to the Eastern front battles I will be equally frustrated when a soviet M42 knocks out a Panther one on one.

Maybe all this is just the AI advantage as another reviewer stated his frustration when he played as the Poles.","PROGRAMERS LOVE AT AND ART, I GUESS.",1340668800,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},
3,True,"08 20, 2014",A3TZSHXIHMYBFL,B0014CN2H6,Kara,"Persona 3: FES started out as a very addicting, fun, and unique JRPG. Being a gamer with hundreds of games from the mainstream to hidden gems, Persona 3 has always been on my list, especially after playing Persona 2 and the Shin Megami Tensei MMO. I was surprised to find that I didn't enjoy Persona 3 as much as I thought I would as the game continued on.

The pacing of the game is poor. There will be periods of time where there are events in-game every other day, followed by two months with only one event happening. Parts of the story are randomly dropped and forgotten about. At one point, the game was just too 'quiet' for too long. It was strange to see this happening when the game started out so great, and this is coming from someone whom has played Final Fantasy 12 (known for a lot of weird things) multiple times.

The story itself is nothing spectacular and is fairly light-hearted, which was surprising considering that all of the SMT games are known for their deep, dark, heavy tales that border on philosophical.

The gameplay itself is fun and addicting. If you like dungeon crawlers a la .Hack or Dark Cloud, you will enjoy Persona 3. If you like games like Harvest Moon or Animal Crossing, you will enjoy the social aspect of the game. However, I enjoy all of the aforementioned games and found myself just trying to beat P3FES to get it over with during the end.

The combat sequences being a little bit of a combination between turn based and cyclical make it a little more interesting, but I can see where it's going to get more than a little confusing farther along as more and more skills and abilities are thrown into the mix.

Jones,"Please note, when I say ""mature"" I don't mean its rated ""M for mature audiences"" (this is rated ""T for teens"", by the way), I mean that the game's protagonists, a scorpion and a tarantula, aren't exactly as cuddly as, say, Crash Bandicoot or Mario, or as stylishly violent and over-the-top as Kratos from God of War or Dante from Devil May Cry.

The goal of the game is pretty plain and simple, survive. As you take turns between playing the tarantula and the scorpion, you will find yourself devouring a number of small insects and attacking fellow predators like other spiders and scorpions, various lizards, rats, and even in a couple of pretty epic battles, a rattlesnake, among other enemies. Also, in a pretty clever move on behalf of the game's creators, it features a compelling subplot between two treasure hunters (with voices provided by Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Hopper) that the two arachnids will run into throughout certain areas of the game.

The controls work pretty good. The lighter and faster attacks are triggered by the large ""A"" button, and heavier attacks are triggered with the wave of the Wii-mote or Nunchuk, and as you go through the game, you learn new fighting moves and abilities. And there are some parts of the game which features mini-games to progress through the level, much like Resident Evil 4 or God of War. The gameplay does feature a nice bit of variety when it comes to combat controls. The tarantula's fighting moves are based on speed and it's ability to jump, and offers a nice bit of platforming thanks to it's web jumping. The scorpion, however, is built more on power, and has some satisfying finishing moves. It also has a nice bit of exploration, thanks to it's ability to dig and cut down grass.

The graphics are pretty good. A lot of the backgrounds in the game look great and give an atmosphere of creepiness, but sometimes are a bit too dark for me to clearly see what's going on. The camera can be a bit problematic at times, too. There were a couple of times where I was playing, and went inside a hole in the ground or a rock, and the camera would remain stuck on the edge of a hole or a cactus (you can center the camera back behind your character by pressing down on the directional pad on the Wii-mote, but even that didn't fix it). There are a couple of other times, where in the middle of web jumping or combat as the tarantula, the camera would fly around and times where it would get stuck, giving me a nice jolt from seeing the tarantula close-up.

The game does have excellent sound. The music is sparse, yet effective, giving more attention to the ambient sound and the dialogue between the two speaking characters which helps greatly in moving the game along.

Overall, I would certainly recommend this game. It's a well-made third party title featuring an original concept. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is arachnophobic, but this is a game that needs support from Wii owners.",A surprising platformer/survival horror/mature title.,1236556800,6,,

2,False,"06 3, 2009",A2ST1JUSO17I1,B00166N6SA,Kindle Customer,"Going from Sims 1 to Sims 2 was amazing.  The new graphics, the new camera controls, customizing your Sim's facial features, etc, etc, etc.  Sadly, there isn't that sense of ""wow"" in Sims 3.

That's okay, I didn't expect a COMPLETE overhaul of the game like we saw with Sims 2.  The Sims 2 is great game, and ""if ain't broke, don't fix it"" right?

Well, here's what I DID expect the Sims 3 to have:

1.  I expected all new animations, interactions, objects, hairstyles, and so on.  There is new stuff, but I feel that more than 50% of the content in this game is ported from the Sims 2.  To me, this is plain lazy and shouldn't have been accepted.  I would understand if a fraction of content was duplicated, but not half.  It seems to me that if they wanted to do it that way, then Sims 3 should have been called The Sims 2 Upgrade.

2.  I expected there to be a noticeable difference between life stages.  Maybe I'm being picky here, but the ""young adult"" and ""adult"" life stages look the same to me.  And the biggest changes from going from ""teen"" to ""young adult"" are new clothing options and no more school.  That's it.  Yeah.  Furthermore, the only way that I've been able to tell the ages of the Sims that I meet, is by going to the ""Throw Party"" option.  The screen that comes up is the only place I can find that tells me whether a Sim is a teen, young adult, or adult.  It is not obvious from their picture or appearance.  If you click on their picture, it gives you some info on who they are but it does not tell you their age.  This is a hassle when I'm trying to find a mate for my Sim and I would like them to be in the same life stage.

3.  I expected Sims 3 to give me baby girls!!!!  I'll admit that this probably only applies to me.  I've had three generations so far, eight sims babies total, and they are all boys.  I even tried saving the game right before birth and reloading it to see if the baby would change gender.  None of them did.  I don't know if other people are having this problem, but it is kind of disappointing how all of the children in my families are the same gender.

4.  I expected Sims 3 to utilize genetics in order to produce unique Sims.  Once I got two boys born at different times that looked like twins.  Not one feature different.  The same thing happened a second time except that one boy was slightly skinnier than the other.  I don't mind all that much, but in my opinion Sims should not be identical unless they are twins.

5.  I expected to follow my Sim to the bookstore and to a restaurant.  The movie theater and job buildings I can understand, but when my Sim disappeared into a restaurant, I couldn't believe it.  And ""it may be included in an expansion pack"" is no excuse.  Restaurants were a fantastic social gathering place in both Sims 1 and Sims 2.  If the option is there, then it should be fleshed out.  Once again, EA was being lazy.

6.  I expected more new content.  Yeah, I already mentioned this, but this is the reason why this game is getting two stars instead of four.  Because as annoying as those other disappointments are, this is the one that cripples this game.  The entire children's toys section is copied from Sims 2, excluding the blocks table.  And that's just one section.  Don't get me started on the animations and social interactions.  I don't understand how the next version of my favorite game could let me down this much.

7.  I expected EA to not charge me twice for the same game.  Paying for stuff at the Sims 3 exchange?!  Do I have to explain this one?  No thank you, EA.  I will wait for the community to distribute better quality custom content for free.  And when tools are released for creating CC, I will create and post my things for free because the Sims community revolves around free content.

Sims 3 isn't all bad.  After all, I am playing it.  The best part of Sims 3 for me is that I can kick out my Sim siblings and they can take care of themselves.  This is wonderful since I like to play Legacy style.  Another good thing is that townies are more attractive.  You get a beastly one here and there, but your Sims community no longer looks like a freak show.  There's more diversity in skin colors and body shapes.  Thanks to the map, you get a sense that your Sims live in a community rather than floating around outer space somewhere.

There are many great things about Sims 3.  Unfortunately, the failings outweigh the successes.  I don't think EA spent very much time at all thinking about the features and upgrades they could put into Sims 3.  I feel like they came up with just enough features to justify it being a ""3"" instead of an ""EP"" so that they could make money.  It's a fun game, but it doesn't feel like a new game.",Feels like The Sims 2 Upgrade,1243987200,78,{'Format:': ' DVD-ROM'},['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41t9qKFBnXL._SY88.jpg']

5,False,"11 20, 2011",A24WWT2W1M61AQ,B0016B28WU,Lisa Traverso,"When you look at Call of Duty now a days, you think of a multi million selling franchise that is stale and is hated. However, let's rewind time back to 2007, when Call of Duty 4 was released, and think back to those glorious days in 2007. Call of Duty 4 was and is a fantastic game, with an expertly designed campaign with an intense story and engaging set pieces, while still feeling fairly realistic, and some of the best multiplayer ever in a first person shooter, and Call of Duty 4 was acclaimed as one of the best shooters of all time. I still stand by this opinion today. Call of Duty, after this game was released, either tried too hard or they simply didn't change their formula. However, that doesn't detract from this fantastic game.

Without going too much into detail on the story, the story revolves around the United States Army and the British SAS as you travel around the world playing as two different soldiers trying to hunt down a terrorist who has caused world wide terror. Unlike Call of Duty games before it, the narrative was one campaign, where the paths of the soldiers crossed, and not everyone made it out alive. The story was not only improved because it was connected, but the modern setting made the story not only refreshing, but it was also presented in a gritty and realistic matter. Modern Warfare really nails the gritty feeling of war and the battlefield, and the set pieces are appropriately thrilling, without detracting from the realism of the campaign. The characters were also memorable and likable, and you really cared about what happened to them at the end of the campaign. With all of these components combined, the story in Modern Warfare is fantastic, and the campaign is the best in the series because of it.

Graphically, while Call of Duty 4 doesn't look quite as great as most games on the market, back in the day the technology was revolutionary, and the game still holds up well today in terms of graphics. The textures were great back then, while looking somewhat underwhelming today, but the game still has some awesome effects, the levels in the singleplayer really look realistic and some of the set pieces are gorgeous. Online, the game runs incredibly well at 60 frames per second. The game runs well and there is never a moment where the visuals aren't on par with the rest of the game.

The sound design is also impressive. The voice acting both in singleplayer and multiplayer is excellent, with a sense of realism and likability to the characters to keep you engaged. The sound design of the guns is also fantastic, and you really feel like you are doing some damage with the assortment of assault riffles, sub machine guns, shotguns, snipers, and pistols given to you during the game. The sound of all of the gun shots, explosions, and terrorist shouts give the game a sense of realism, intensity, and urgency that is rarely seen in other shooters. In addition, the original score is fantastic, being memorable and explosive when it needs to be, but also dark and eerie to match the mood set by the game. The sound design is overall fantastic and adds a lot to the game.

Call of Duty 4's gameplay is the best in the series, and is nearly flawless. To start, the mechanics remain similar to the Call of Duty games before: Aiming down your sights with your weapon and auto aiming enemies in the campaign with a fairly linear design and smooth controls. However, Call of Duty 4 was even faster in terms of how the game ran, and this made the battles more intense and made the mechanics even smoother. The controls also feel the most responsive out of any Call of Duty game, making running, going prone, aiming, and throwing back enemy grenades feel smooth and effortless. The campaign action is also much better than in the other games before. The enemy AI and friendly AI are both much better than in the previous games. Your friendly AI actually fights realistically and will save your lives, while the enemies take more flanking positions and perform more tactics to take you down. The AI isn't exactly perfect, as sometimes there are a few dumb terrorists who run at you, but overall they are pretty smart and provide a good challenge. The levels are also expertly designed, giving the player plenty of option in how they want to take down their enemy. In addition, the grit in the story creates some awesome set pieces and intense moments in the campaign, such as a hardcore sniping mission where you need to actually use the wind to judge how you want to shoot your bullet, some helicopter turret scenes, and an eerie mission where you take down enemies from above using an AC-130 gunship. All of these components add to a campaign that is short, but ultimately unforgettable and one of the best in its genre. On top of this, there are multiple difficulty settings which make the game much more challenging from level to level. There are also a couple of dozen of pieces of enemy intel to collect, which give you unlockables such as unlimited ammo in the singleplayer. There is also an option called arcade mode, where you play through the levels of the campaign, racing against the clock to complete objectives as well as getting extra points for double kills, grenade kills, ect. It is quite a nice addition to the game.

The singleplayer in Call of Duty 4 is intense, fun, and unforgettable, but the real star of the game is the incredible online multiplayer. Call of Duty 4's multiplayer is fantastic and revolutionized many shooters today. Call of Duty's smooth mechanics from the campaign transition perfectly over to multiplayer, however the real star of Call of Duty 4 is the ability to customize your load out. In later Call of Duty games, this feature is expanded, with gun ranking, more perks, death streaks, and other components that made the series unbalanced and far too over the top. However, in Call of Duty 4, customization comes in the form of perks, which give your character special abilities such as extra damage, more ammo, and the ability to drop a grenade upon death, gun attachments and camo, and unlocking new weapons. As you play through Call of Duty 4, you rank up and unlock more weapons, attachments, camo, and perks to customize your load out. Perks are special abilities that enhance your character or class, and you can customize them accordingly. You can assign three perks to each class, with three different categories. The first one is for ammo, attachments, or special weapons, the second one is more for your actual combat such as extra dammage or faster reload, and perk three is generally between the first one and the third one, they enhance you in actual combat, but they don't necessarily make you more powerful. These can be steady aim, or dropping a live grenade when you die. The perks work so well because not only do they add a dimension of strategy in your loadouts, and assigning proper perks to proper weapons, but the system is also incredibly balanced, and for every perk there is there is always one to counter it. This makes the game feel very balanced, regardless of your level. The weapons also feel balanced, no one weapon is too powerful or too weak, and depending on the type of player you are, you can use whatever you want and still do good in a match. The balanced gameplay and constant ranking make the multiplayer design not only revolutionary and balanced, but also keeps you addicted and is loads of fun. The game modes are pretty typical for a first person shooter, with your deathmatch, domination, and search and destroy modes you expect from the series, but the addition or hardcore, which causes bullet damage to be much higher and the HUD to go away, and old school, where every weapon and perk is a pick up, add a new dimension to the game modes, and makes them unique and exciting.

Overall, Call of Duty 4 is one of the best shooters on the market. It isn't perfect mind you, the visuals are slightly dated, the campaign is short, and the multiplayer does have some lag. However, these are very small problems compared to how much Call of Duty 4 does right. It's campaign is gritty, exciting, and powerful, while the multiplayer is addicting, balanced, and fun. Add on some seriously awesome sound design and an excellent frame rate, and you have yourself one complete and excellent package. If you are a shooter fan, don't hesitate to buy Call of Duty 4. It is much better than any of the Call of Duty games to come out recently. If you already own Call of Duty 4, do yourself a favor and forget about the new games in the series, and take a trip down memory lane and experience this masterpiece once again.

Final Tally:

Presentation: 9.5/10: The story is gritty, realistic, and awesome. The mood of the game is also awesome, and the multiplayer is fantastic. The short campaign is hardly a complaint.

Graphics: 9/10: While somewhat dated today in terms of the textures, the lighting, character models, animations, and framerate are all excellent.

Sound: 10/10: The sound design makes each battle feel intense and engaging, the voice acting is fantastic and makes you connect to the soldiers, and the original score adds a lot to the overall experience.

Gameplay: 9.5/10: The AI is only slightly off in the campaign, though they are mostly consistant. The set pieces are breathtaking and the campaign is expertly designed. The multiplayer is outstanding and by far one of the best on the market, despite a small amount of lag.

Replay Value: 9.5/10: While the campaign is short, it is engaging and there are things to keep you coming back to it. The multiplayer is excellent, however, and will keep you playing long after you beat the campaign.

When i first purchased bioshock 1, i was really surprised how the game was a creepy unknown shooter. I would say the first was one of the best single player games when it comes to shooting games. I want to put this in a few sections.

Graphics:

The graphics are pretty much the same as the first one. Nothing really changed much but it is still great with some new effects. It appears to have more of a watery environment now. There are more sea cucumbers and things in the sea around rapture. (Which i don't mind) So basically the graphics are just as great as the first if not better.

Gameplay:

Like 2K said, the game will be more focused in combat, and well it is. Personally i kinda prefer the new combat because the action in the first seemed to got boring once in the a while. You get to use weapons and plasmids at the same time which seems way better and fun. The plasmids hasn't really changed from the first. They just got new upgrades. Same goes with the weapons. The weapons look different but still the same but with upgrades. But the combat really makes up for it. It can get really intense when guarding a little sister or fighting a big daddy. I have heard people saying it was short. I agree that's its a little shorter then the first so i recommend that you put the single player to hard and no viet chambers (The chambers you respwan in when you die). That will really make the game challenging if you're not satisfied. The enemies are a lot stronger and smarter. Especially when you fight a big daddy, big sister, and the big looking splicer. One of the best updated thing is the new hacking system. Say goodbye to those annoying pipes

Multiplayer:

I bet many people are wondering how the multiplayer is. Well i will say its very good and fun. It may not be s intense as cod but its fun. I would say it is more of a running around the stage type. There are 5 modes in teams and alone. They all have a lot of action so they are all great modes. I say it is a great addition to bioshock 2 which is worth playing. There are a total of 10 maps and several weapons. You kinda level up like in call of duty i suppose. Overall the multiplayer is great and it will make you come back once in a while.

Pros:

Fun Multiplayer
Great Single player (recommend on hard mode and travel everywhere in rapture)
Better action and combat
stronger enemies

cons:

familiar to the first but hey its a squeal what do you expect

1,False,"02 11, 2010",A250AXLRBVYKB4,B0016BVYAM,ConsumerAdvocate (dakotad555) at (gmail) dot (com),"This review is intended to help educate potential buyers of Bioshock 2 about a few of the major downsides of the way 2K has decided to sell the game. If you've already made up your mind to buy it, or already own it, this review isn't for you. If on the other hand you're on the fence, I'd love to point out a few things that are very troubling about Bioshock 2:

1) The game REQUIRES online activation. If you are a serviceman/servicewoman stationed in Baghdad (or anywhere in the field without internet) you're totally screwed. Requiring an internet connection to activate is offensive in itself, but coupled with the other major issues with this game's DRM scheme, it just keeps getting worse.

2) The game limits the number of times you can install it. I don't care if they give me 1,000 installs, any limit on how long I can use a game I paid for simply isn't acceptable. I'm not paying for the 'privilege' of installing how ever many times 2K or anyone else thinks is appropriate. If I buy a game, I want to actually BUY it, meaning I OWN IT and CAN DO WHAT I WANT WITH IT. If I buy the game and don't like it, how can I resell it? How can I verify to the person I'm selling it to that it has installations left? This is just a petty and insulting way to treat paying customers. I don't want to have to come crawling back to 2K or Microsoft to explain why I might need more installations for a game I already gave them forty or more dollar for. And what if they close their doors at some point in the future? How can I be guaranteed I'll still have access to my game?

3) Securom, the DRM package used by Bioware, installs with the game and there is no option to install it without Securom. That means you get a program running in the background when you play the game that can create issues for other programs on your computer. Don't believe me? I experienced all sorts of issues with the Securom that installed with Mass Effect I including it screwing up my drivers for my optical drives because it didn't like the fact that I has DeamonTools on my computer. I don't want crapware or potential security threats loading on my computer alongside the game!

4) You MUST create a WindowsLive account if you want to access certain parts of the game. I hate WindowsLive and everything to do with it and don't want to create accounts to play my game. I want to install it, run the game, and be on my merry way. Forcing creation of an account is what marketers call ""forced opt-in"" and it opens you up to all sorts of information mining so that Microsoft or whoever collects the data can sell it to marketing companies. Forced opt-ins just flat out suck and I hate when companies force you to jump through their hoops to play their game.

SO WHY DOES THE GAME COME LOADED UP WITH THIS NONSENSE????

2K would say its to fight piracy. I say bull-****. DRM doesn't affect pirates as they're already downloading the widely available and free versions of this (and any other game) from torrent sites. To the inevitable idiots who will spam the comments of this review accusing me of being either a pirate or too poor to buy the game: 1) I own literally hundreds of games and paid for every single one of theme and 2) if I was a pirate I'd already be playing the game from a torrent site without any of the limitations of DRM. Bottom line: if you want to pirate the game, it's pretty amazingly easy. I don't pirate because I'm honest, but neither do I give my money to game makers who like to insult my intelligence by telling me DRM is 'necessary' or that force me to install crapware on my computer.

Thanks but no thanks. I'll take a pass on this one.

**********UPDATE 02/17/2010**********

I had the opportunity to play Bioshock II on my friend's Xbox. Frankly I wasn't impressed with the game itself. It's very much a copy of the original game with very little that is new. I thought the game would center around being an all powerful Big Daddy. You do play as a Big Daddy, but you're not any stronger than the human character starting out in Bioshock I. I expected them to let you be more powerful but also introduce more powerful / numerous opponents. Instead, the same collection of splicers come in twos and threes just like the original game. So as a Big Daddy, it takes 2-3 melee hits (with a huge-*** drill bit mind you) to kill a splicer. It takes them 4-5 melee hits to kill you. That's just simply stupid considering when you fight another Big Daddy it takes a HUGE amount of firepower to bring one down. The whole concept of being a Big Daddy is diminished because you really are not any more powerful.

It's like they took EVERYTHING from the first game, just tweaked it a bit, and called it a new game. There is nothing new that feels significant. The weapons are not exciting, and some of them feel almost useless (the shotgun for one). Only the spear gun and rivet gun have a satisfying quality to them.

You still have the same simplistic moral choice (harvest or rescue Little Sisters), the same voice over the radio guiding you, and the same antagonistic voice prodding you along as you progress through the game. You get plasmids in the same order (electricity, then fire, then ice) and use them to solve the same problems as before (opening doors with electricity, melting snow with fire, etc...). Really it feels like they just redid the first game with less compelling characters and a less compelling storyline.

I'm actually VERY glad I didn't buy this game, even if it were DRM free because it isn't that interesting. It's a rehash of the first and doesn't have anything really remarkable to distinguish it. Honestly, I've played MODS that were free that provided a better gaming experience than this. A good example would be the BT MOD for Oblivion which made Oblivion feel like an entirely new game. For the price 2k is asking (full retail for a new game!) it's just ridiculous.

There are much better options out there. Go get Mass Effect II if you don't have it yet, or even Call of Pripyat from the venerable STALKER series. Both are a lot better than this.

Final thoughts:

It doesn't bother me if you want to buy this game and install it. I just want you to have all the facts before you do. If you don't agree with my perspective that's fine--this is a free country (assuming you live in the USA). Bottom line: some people do care about protecting consumer rights and I'm one of those people. Agree or disagree, I think everyone should have the right to information about the product they're buying.

You're immediately put onto a track and given a simple, but fun tutorial on the basics of the game.

I thought this was a great touch because you're given a taste of the game before you even see the main menu.  After that, the voice-over guy continues to help you as you race and as you upgrade your ATV.  All of the voice-overs are context sensitive and are actually very helpful for someone new to the game.  This feature might be a huge bonus for someone who's looking to buy this game for a child who might not be patient enough to read manuals or wade through menus.  I don't find the voice-overs annoying at all, but you do have the option of turning down the narrator volume in the game options.

When you start racing, the first thing you notice is how pretty this game really is.  The graphics are vibrant and detailed with a touch special effects like HDR and motion blur.  In addition to the solid frame rate and great sense of speed, Pure looks really, really polished.

The controls are simple and easy enough to pick up.  Along with the narrator giving you tips, you also have on screen indicators of which buttons to press to try out new things.  Paired with the solid controls, you also get a great camera system that seems to always swivel to an angle that gives you a good view of what's coming up.

When you win races, you automatically unlock parts that you can use to upgrade or customize your ATV.  The customization options are almost overwhelming, especially if you're someone who doesn't really know anything about ATVs to begin with.  As you're cycling through all the parts that you can change or customize, the voice-over guy gives a quick explanation of what the part does and how it will affect your performance.

You can tune difference performance aspects like acceleration, top speed, handling, tricks, etc. by picking from different parts for your vehicle.  I haven't managed to unlock everything yet, but the upgrade options seem plentiful and unlocking them by winning races is very rewarding.

After tuning your ATV, you can also customize how it looks by changing the various body panel pieces, the handle bars, the seat, etc.  You pick from a pretty big variety of options and even change the color on some pieces.

Normally, I'm not a big fan of stunt racing kind of games, but Pure is definitely the exception.  It's a fast paced, arcade-style game that just about anyone can pick up and play.

On the other hand, for a game that came out at the same time as GTA 4, I felt the graphics and physics were a little bit behind GTA 4.  Nevertheless, it was stilI l hugely enjoyable.

Driving was a little challenging at first and never got as comfortable using a PC as the driving on GTA 4.

I am using an i7 quad core laptop with Windows 7 so I never experienced any problems with frame rates or delays of any kind, even when driving the fastest cars.

As I noted, it was probably as fun as GTA 4 but in different ways.  I believe that if they get the graphics and physics improved for their next game due out this year, it'll be even better.

There's always somebody condemning the popular well-made game because it's ""overrated"" (which by the way, is quickly becoming the quickest way to complain rather than detail why) and the occasional game that was taken apart by critics yet you go ""oh come on, that game was pretty fun, what's the deal?"" However, what do you do when that game is ""Sonic Unleashed"", another entry in the malighed 3D Sonic games which by all accounts, haven't been good since the days on the Dreamcast and coming after the colossal failure of ""Sonic the Hedgehog""? Well showing mild reluctance, I decided to give the game a shot with the hope it will surprise me. And you know what, it did...that is not entirely but it did.

Story: Just like Bowser, Eggman can't seem to take a hint and he's still up to trouble so up in space (in a fantastic FMV cutscene), Sonic does battle with his minions only walks into a trap: Sonic's Chaos Emeralds are drained of energy and wreaks havoc upon the Earth and literally tears it in pieces. Side effect is that by night, Sonic now turns into a clawed, furry beast named a Werehog so with the hope of his buddy Tails and new support character Navi...sorry, Chip, Sonic has to put the world back together.

Graphics: My previous Sega game was ""Nights: Journey into Dreams"" on the Nintendo Wii which I felt looked stunning and colorful and this game is no different. Colors are vibrant, animation is pretty consistent and the speed is stunning. FMV's are particularly amazing and the in-game cutscenes look pretty good too. Only problem is that sometimes during the daytime races, the rings, traps and general level layout make it difficult to avoid missing the rings or hitting spikes that came up too quick. But other than that, the game looks great in HD.

Sound/Music: Anyone who's played Sonic games when they introduced voice knows how generally painful they were to hear. Well in this game, hearing that there was Japanese, I went straight to it and it was actually pretty alright, considering. While Chip is young sounding, the voice acting never becomes ear-closing like the English ones. And thankfully, Sega did the same thing with Nights and actually did a orchestral score which is thankfully worth listening to. Some tracks don't gel and don't really do anything but the big dramatic numbers work well. And of course the ring and checkpoint sounds are the same which also brings up nice nostalgic moments.

Gameplay: Many games over the years have always tried to add variety to keep you from becoming bored. Whereas previous Mario, Sonic and the like titles were standard 2D platformers, the 3D stuff always tries to add more and more and in Sonic Unleashed it comes down to 2 gameplay modes: the daytime where Sonic runs his blue self as quick as he can and the nighttime where he's a beat-em-up werehog. The daytime levels are to be blunt, fast as hell, and when things get going, that energy and speed of previous games return only there's a price in that it makes it that much harder to avoid traps and more than once I ran into spikes or tripped causing a decrease in speed and naturally, you're graded at the end so if you're not a fast little bugger, be prepared to get at best a ""C"". Trial-and-error or just blind luck are the key ideas here and worse, hidden in the levels are medals and when you're travelling at no pun intended, supersonic speeds, missing these things is quite easily done.

The other is the werehog levels where Sonic travels through levels beating up bad guys with DMC or God of War-style combo chains and it somewhat works but it's quite repetitive however the biggest complaints are really 2 things. One, they're a bit too long with some lasting 20 minutes and to spend that long brawling is a bit buzzkilling. The other is that to kill enemies faster and with cooler skill points you gotta do the ol' quicktime events and there's not a whole lot of button presses for some but the problem is the speed. Imagine a button coming up as well as a timer where you have to hit the buttons as quick as you can lest you take damage and enemies gain some of their health back. Now imagine a timer that's wildly inconsistent where it'll either be slow and manageable and other times will be a missed button press because the time it took to move your thumb to the right button and press it was not fast enough. It made quite a few encounters trying but then again, they've always been like this in games. The camera woes are back as well where the camera will sometimes change to new angles and mess you up and you're like ""gah, let me see what I'm doing!"" but at least the platforms aren't as far and thin as other games but it's still a gripe.

So with near damning reviews available to read on websites, does Sonic Unleashed require an ignore; a pass because of its awfulness? Not quite. It's not quite a perfect Sonic adventure but it's not the travesty some claim and it's certainly better than the last outing.

Upon playing through the campaign for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised at this game!  It's pretty great, and definitely entertaining!  The only cons I can really think of is that they could have had more unit types for each faction (UNSC/Covenant) and it would have been nice to play as the Flood and the Forerunners too (these are limited to opponents in the campaign).  However, for those cons, I would have to say that they probably bothered me just because I am used to other, bigger RTS games like Age of Empires.  Campaign gets 5/5 stars.

Multiplayer is pretty awesome, providing 1 v 1, 2 v. 2, and 3 v. 3 matches, either through Skirmish (a mixture of humans and AI) or true online play (human only).  Online play can be somewhat monotonous though, as most people attempt a strategy known as ""rushing,"" attacking your base within 10 minutes of the start time.  However, that's no knock against them or the game...it's just a strategy.  Multiplayer gets 3/5 stars.

Unfortunately, where music games are the strengths of other video games systems, that sadly has been the weakness for the Nintendo Wii. After a pair of dissapoiments from Guitar Hero III, where gamers were having trouble hearing the songs they were jamming to in stereo sound, and with the recent release of Rock Band that unfortunately lacks in online gaming and downloading new songs to jam to and those extra tracks are set to be released as seperate game discs for the Wii starting in July. While die hard Guitar Hero fans are anxiously awaiting Guitar Hero IV, they now have a new chance to Walk This Wii-Way.

Guitar Hero: Aerosmith for the Nintendo Wii, is the latest spin-off in the video game franchise. While the last spin-off, Guitar hero: Rocks The 80's was only available for the Playstation 2, this is the first spin-off available for the Wii. The game features many of Aerosmith's big hits from their 4 decades as Rock Gods. While you get to jam to most of the tracks from them including some of their classics like Back In The Saddle, Love In An Elevator, the 1987 hit Rag Doll, their standard signature song Dream On, as well as some of Steven Tyler and company with some of their lesser-known songs here including Make It, Uncle Salty and No Surprize. But, it isn't just Aerosmith alone with their tracks. Other artists have guest spots with their great songs that inspired Aerosmith including Cheap trick with Dream Police, Lenny Kravitz with Always On The Run, and Joan Jett & The Blackhearts with I Hate Myself For Loving You. The graphics look great and the gameplay really feels a bit more refreshing for Wii gamers than Rock Band because you can battle against others online, as well as play your way through career mode where you can unlock more songs to master with your guitar, and battle in co-op mode.

While sadly, I wish there could've been a bit more songs from Aerosmith's career to master like Crazy and I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing to play, when it comes down to the great music games for the Nintendo Wii, while gamers might feel more enthusiastic about Rock Band on the Wii, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is really a better buy for your money and to jam to great music with. While there are many fans anxiously awaiting to see what makes Guitar Hero IV develop, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is definitely one that strums into the way of Joe Perry's rifts and Aerosmith's hearts.

From similar killing combos to finding the hidden bullseye targets during the levels. The Graphics are actually pretty sweet if you play it in HD. There's tons of cussing during gameplay and during cinemas. Wouldn't be 50 if it wasn't. Not a serious storyline but a decent one if it were a low budget ""B"" movie.

Like other sim-type games, you are able to customize environments and clothing of some characters and have the freedom to explore and interact, but the similarities mostly end there. You do not control all of the characters/are not able to switch control from one character to another, and there is some linear flow to the action. You are given a series of missions on each of a few locales; as you progress, you are allowed to explore new locales, as well as accumulate options from all current and previous locations.

The basic idea is to rebuild and fix different places and help the residents in each one. Sometimes that means finding objects, other times, talking with people to resolve conflicts. To build structures or machines, etc., you need to have certain points which can be found by toying with trees, plants, and other objects. You also need raw materials that are sometimes hidden, or other times uncovered by mining (you have to find hot spots and then use the controller like a little pick axe) or digging, as though for buried treasure.

Sometimes it is a little repetitive, but that is the nature of the genre, and all in all, the loose structure and dialogue keep things moving. It would probably be more entertaining if the characters spoke a real language,  but apparently the makers wanted to save on having to do multiple voice-overs and translations, so that's a bit of a loss there, especially for some younger kids, but having dialogue is still appreciated. Also, having to figure out mechanical puzzles might be trickier for the younger crowd, it's fun having to use a little spatial reality logic to make things work, though it's not Very challenging.

I took mine apart and was relieved to see that mine were correct and seem to play fine. Fixing them, if there is a problem, doesn't seem too tricky. Yes, I realize that would void a warranty, but the wait to replace time would drive me nuts.

The game is very solid. I play quitar mainly and have a wireless RB and GH quitar. I prefer the Guitar Hero guitars. The new version of the quitar seems to be an improvement over both the quitars I have. I seem to have a easier time hitting the quick sequences.

Don't get me wrong the game itself is just as fun in the other consoles but the wii lacks of a differentiated characteristic for this game and many other games in particular.

The first problem is the controllers, if you want to play 4 people you would need 4 wii motes; YES, the microphone requires one too. Why do I say is a disadvantage on the Wii? well because if you don't have 4 controllers you need to go and spend more money for more controllers and compared to the X-Box and ps3 versions where you don't need that many controllers the pricing is still the same. For gh3 the wii version was [...] cheaper, well it is not for this one. At the least the microphone should have had a button and forget about having another controller. I wanted to play guitar and sing and have a friend come over to play drums but I would need 3 wii motes and I only have 2.

My other concern is the downloadable content. Apparently the 360 and ps3 versions have more songs than the wii version for some packaging problem with the songs, nintendo simply didn't care and took those songs out of the way. For your information those songs happen to be a couple of metallica and jimi hendrix songs, In my opinion way better than R.E.M or Oasis for downloadable content.

And last but not least, graphic quality is lower than its counterparts. This does not really concern me because you don't buy this game (or the wii for that matter) for the graphics but I'm just saying this game is way inferior that the other consoles.

Like I said the game is really fun and all that but if you own a ps3 or an xbox 360 you are better of with those consoles than with the Wii.

Reviewer: PMMM from Annapolis on Oct 9, 2008
This is an incredible game. It's an import from Poland based on a very popular series of novels there. The inital translation to English was not great, and there were serious issues on machines with nVidia graphics, but a recent patch calld Enhanced Edition fixed all of those problems as well as improved perfomance of the game and added new content. If you bu the standard, original version of the game, the Enhanced Edition patch is free on the publisher's website. The Enhanced Edition boxed set includes all of the books and maps and such that were not included in the original US/English release.

Unlike many American and Japanese RPGs which allow you to builda character from scratch, this game requires you to play the main protagonist. This is because the complexity of the story requires you to play a male Witcher. Anything else would take away from the story. And this RPG has THE strongest story line of any RPG I've ever played. Some might feel that strong storyline = linear play, but that is not the case here. You play the game in chapters (like the books) and can accomplish you tasks within each chapter in any order or fashion you prefer, You can even go back and forth between chapters as need be. You just can't advance to a new chapter until you completed the requisite tasks to unlock it.

It does take a little getting used to the controls, but once you do the play is smooth and feels natural. You are required to actually fight the enemy. Its all still clicking, but unlike games where you can click and forget, this one requires you to stay on target and click during specific times else you will lose targeting and eventually lose. The potion use feels like it could really happen that way, vice the standard RPG potion recovery system.

The biggest issue I have are the no-go zones.  The games is certainly open, but not as open as Oblivion, where you can literally get to everywhere you see.  In The Witcher there are definite paths you will be stuck on from time to time.  Most farm fields you can see are out of bounds, so you cannot actualy traverse them.  As far as flaws go, you probably won't notice it too much, as the game is so engaging.

Graphics are incredible, even on a modest machine. And this is an M rated game for a reason. There are points in the storyline which all but require you to engage in sexual themes, so be warned if you're intending to buy this for a minor. There are very few mods out there for this game, but, like practically every other game, there are ""nudity mods"". You're forewarned.",A must-have for RPG fans.,1223510400,2,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

Hayes,"Before I begin I would like to start by saying that I picked up Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice the day of its release on August 26, 2008.  There have been numerous updates to the game since then and I shall detail them first. (DLC=downloadable content from the playstation store)

1. Trophy Support added as of July 30, 2009
2. DLC of Characters from previous Disgaea Titles ($1.99 each)
3. DLC of modes to share states online
4. DLC of chapters for one of the side characters (Rasberyl) adds roughly 10-20 hours of gameplay.

Generally speaking the only addition most players will need is the FREE trophy support update which you may be prompted to get if you are buying the game for the first time.  Who doesnt want PS3 trophys?

-----------------------------------
Anyway all of that aside, Disgaea 3 is the third in the demon underworld strategy japanese role playing game from NIS.  Although it carries the 3 behind its title, the story is completely unrelated to the other games and introduces an entire new cast of characters.  The only returning characters are NIS signature Prinny's which add a bit of comedic relief.

The game explores the story at this underworld school as you, as Mao the overlord's son, are an honor student dedicated to trying to get revenge on his father since he broke his video games that he had invested thousands of hours of playtime on.  You are also trying to be the number one delinquent in this school since that is what is good in the demon underworld. The story proceeds on through about 8 or 9 of these chapters that expand from this minor story to one that is greater and more epic as you go through plot twists, face the upperclassman sophomores and the diez gentleman (a group of upperclassman students), and more.

Along the way other storyline characters join the quest such as Almaz von Adamant Almadine (who wants to be a hero), Princess Sapphire, Rasberyl and her friends, a few teachers.  The character cast is actually quite hilarious as you will face a Home Economics Teacher, Master Big Star the Sophomore Class Leader, and even the PTA.

The story is enjoyable and lasted me about 100 hours to get through...
------------------------------------------

Gameplay, Disgaea plays out like the previous version.  You play as Mao and can create new characters to join your team.  Characters can come from numerous classes.  Each class has about 6 tiers with level requirements to satisfy unlocking more.  You can also transmigrate your character to a higher tear (but they will start at level 1) or to another group altogether.  Basically if you want to explore the system you can but some players can breeze through the game using just the first tier of character straightway.

Additional caveats to character creation include the ability to alter their weapon choices by having them use a variety of weapons and gaining the skills and level points for it, you can also go into the ""class world"" to boost a few of their abilities, or go into the item world to boost the points of the item.  Furthermore in the items you can move the residents (basically character who give additional features to the item such as higher health, or exp gain), to other items or combine them. Once again the possibilities are endless but you can go through the game to avoid it.

Additonal caveats
-Players gain experience points in battle to level up
-Players gain mana points in battle when they vanquish an opponent
-Mana points are used to learn and boost abilities (evilties), boost skills/learn new skills, or to use in the ""Homeroom"" to make new characters, or pass topics in homeroom (tons of topics, useful in the post storymode to unlock the maps to get bosses and previous characters and DLC)

Generally speaking the way in which the gameplay is setup it can cater to a variety of players, new people can breeze through it, while other players can invest in FAQS or guides to dig into the statistics and boost their characters for hours on end.  The level limit is 9999, you can do billions of damage, but all of that depends on how much time you are willing to invest post game. Once you beat the story mode you can go back and keep using your characters, everything transfers over except for unlockable characters which you will get at the time you unlocked them

For new players, the game works by you going to the gate keeper and then selecting the next map, there is no exploration or anything of that nature.

Production Values
-Sound:  The Disgaea soundtrack by Tenpei Sato is true to the series. A few tracks from previous titles return while there are tons of news ones. Extreme Outlaw Overlord will never get old (plays when you are in the schoolgrounds), and nothing ever gets old.  Most of the songs convey the story scenes emotion quite well.
-Voices, Voices are available in Japanese or English, English sounds good to be honest. I love the lines Almaz has as well as the passion with which Mao's voice actor speaks.

Graphics: 2D sprites are nice, battle animations start off unimpressive, but if you raise the tier higher these attacks look flashier and more powerful.  Vasa Aergun for Mao looks awesome and never gets old.  Get a gunner and try those higher level attacks, lol.  Actually a few attacks look quite brutal!

Overall the game can last anywhere from 40 hours to thousands of hours depending on your play style. Ive actually gone back since beating it at 80 hours to unlock more stuff and to raise my characters to above lvl 500, with some characters at lvl 4500!  Some of the trophies are a feat to get.  It was well worth the 50$ I spent on this game.

I bought this new version, expecting the same core gameplay, updated for the Wii. Well, that's what I got. Only problem is, as other reviewers have said, there are very few updates. That wouldn't bother me so much, but what has been changed has been changed for the WORSE! Instead of the simple ""acre"" system from the first game, you now have to walk on a round ""globe"". Personally, it made me dizzy, and it also makes it hard to find things. Everything must be controlled with the Wii remote. To do something as simple as open the menu, you have to raise your arm, move the cursor, and click on something (where previously you could just push a button); while walking around, I had to keep my arm raised CONSTANTLY. Very tiring. But the worst of all is that you can no longer ask your neighbors for jobs, etc! THEY will approach YOU if they want something; if you talk to them more than once in a row, they get annoyed and start yelling at you. This makes it much harder to find things to do. Just to add insult to injury, they now make you water the flowers. That's right, you must water EVERY SINGLE FLOWER, EVERY DAY. Otherwise they turn brown.  After two days of watering flowers and hanging around, waiting for the villagers to ask me for something, I got bored out of my skull and went back to the GC Animal Crossing.

4,True,"06 18, 2010",A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,B001CMIUYS,Sam Allen,"For me, Final Fantasy XIII was a slightly disappointing departure from some classic elements of the series, but also introduced several new innovations that had me glued to the screen for hours on end.

Gone were the massive dungeons that demanded exploration through every nook and cranny to find every hidden treasure you could get your hands on, and the game's highly linear structure and almost platform-gaming styled environments served as a further reminder that the ""World Map"" concept of getting from place to place had been dead and buried starting with number 10. To some, these would be enough to turn them off of wanting to play it whatsoever. But I was open to a little change; I have no problem with platform gaming, and I don't think any dungeon in any game in the series could ever be as cool as Ultimecia's Castle in FFVIII.

When discussing the new innovations, one MUST begin with the battle system. Unlike the traditional ATB system that was fully established in FFV, the turn-based system of FFX, this rights the problems with FFXII's MMO-styled combat system. The active time gauge returns, and you can chain abilities together based on how many ATB slots a character has. Abilities are determined by Crystal Points (won after every battle) that give you the ability to level up your character and teach them new abilities; the system is similar to the Sphere Grid of FFX, but a HUGE step up on the execution factor. Six character classes, universal to each character eventually in the story, are featured: Commando (for physical attacks), Ravager (for magic attacks), Medic (for healing), Sentinel (for bait and defense), Saboteur (for status magic to hurt the enemy), and Synergist (for status magic to help the party). I personally much prefer this over the job system of FFIII, FFV and FFX2.

While you only control one player's actions at a time, you control what actions all your party can or cannot use by mixing up the character classes to what best suits the fight you are in, known as the paradigms. You can create up to six paradigms at a time, and change at any time during the battle. The stagger gauge is also a big new feature; you can build it up quickly using attack magic and keep it from depleting quickly by using physical attacks, and once it's filled, you can let rip on enemies for big damage. Sometimes it takes a long time to fill, but it definitely adds a new level of depth never seen before in the game's battle system.

In addition to this whole new combat system, there are some of the presentation values to discuss. They are simply jaw dropping, from the environments, to character designs, to sound effects, and everything in between. The music is somewhat less impressive than in some previous installments, and the voice acting is a little annoying sometimes, mainly because of Vanille's voice, which takes some getting used to due to its overtly perky nature. The plot is what kept me playing this game for hours on end without ever wanting to quit; every twist, every shocking moment, keeps you glued to the set.

The few negatives mentioned is why it does not get a perfect overall score, but there was plenty of fun to be had when I played through it all the way, including a rewarding ending. There is no doubt I will be coming back to it one day down the road, just to relive all the brilliant moments of the story.","Call me an idiot fanboy if you must, but I loved it.",1276819200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5,False,"02 28, 2009",AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B001CRO8U8,mwreview,"I've been playing SimAnimals off and on since it was released and I'm really getting the hang of it.  The goal is to keep the forest thriving and the animals happy so that they will move in and reproduce.  As you do well in certain areas of the forest, you will be able to move to other areas where you will encounter new animals and plants to satisfy.  I learned from a trailer that this game uses the calendar on the DS to grow plants appropriate for the seasons, so as summer and then fall comes around, we're supposed to see new plants emerge in the game like pumpkins.  That will be cool. The following are some things I've learned while playing the game that I hope will help others who may be frustrated at first.

Missions:  Pay attention to the star at the left top corner.  Click it and it will let you know what you need to accomplish, i.e. having an animal sniff your hand or shaking a pollinating flower.  Doing these things will give you big time points and will earn you awards.

Watering:  You have to keep the plants and trees watered to keep them alive.  Younger plants and trees or ones that you plant yourself will need to be watered all the time (cauliflower also needs to be watered frequently) until they mature while the older plants and trees hardly need to be watered at all.  I like to be preventative when it comes to watering.  Click on the plant or tree and it will show its profile which will include a watering level.  If the level is not full, I water it.  I don't wait for emergencies if I can prevent it. As another reviewer mentioned, you can put rain clouds in your pack and carry them to thirsty plants which will save time going back and forth between the plants and the lake.  Having a few clouds in your pack is also useful in case a lightning storm hits and starts a fire.  Another trick I've used is to water several plants with one cloud.  Have a cloud rain on a plant for a few seconds and watch the water level fill up and then move the cloud to another plant.  When your forest is doing well, you can make storm clouds that can be used to kill weeds (but be careful as the lightning can start fires and burn things you need).

Animals: Check their profiles so that you know what kind of food they like and where they like to live.  If you have unhappy animals, the profiles can give you a clue as to why they're sad (not enough food they like, no place to sleep, etc.).  They also tell you if they are hungry or need attention.  Their profiles also give you a close-up look at the animals and they are adorable!  When a squirrel is deliriously happy, he looks so cute and funny it makes me laugh.  When feeding them, as with watering duties, use your pack.  Carry food around so you are ready if you find hungry animals.  It is a good idea to hold food in front of the animals and let them eat out of your hand.  It increases their trust in you. Sometimes animals will fall in love and, zap!, a baby animal appears and it is so cute! One thing I recently found out is that birds need sticks to make nests or they will be sad come bedtime.  You get sticks by intentionally letting bushes die.

I hope this review helps some people who may have some troubles with the game.  I learned these things mostly by trial and error and also from other players (i.e. the tip on creating sticks for nests).  SimAnimals is a very fun game and I look forward to playing it whenever I can.  I'm only at the fourth section of the forest and know I will be learning new things and encountering new animals as I progress in the game (yes, I'm sure I'll get frustrated when I can't figure something out at first, but that is part of gameplay).

The first thing to do is to throw out the Wiimote waggle controls (which just don't feel naturally accessible at all) and just use the Classic or Gamecube controller.

The battle system is exceedingly simple (one face button attacks, another uses your special weapon and another your super attack, while the shoulder buttons are used for blocking and jumping). Once you get the hang of it (which shouldn't take long) it plays a bit like Power Stone (you can run in any direction, not always just facing your opponent).

5,False,"01 18, 2012",AUO5IZSZ1F3UR,B001CWXAP2,Tyler B. Joyner,"Ahh, it's been a long time coming, hasn't it?  I mean, the game took five years to develop and the hype began about when development did.  I have to admit to being underwhelmed by most of the videos of actual game play that came out during development, while being awed (like everyone else) by the cinematic videos.  Given how much the gaming industry has grown and changed since they began development, it was hard for me to imagine that The Old Republic would still be a relevant and worthwhile experience when it finally came out.

I have never been more happy about being wrong.  This is by far one of the best games I've ever played, if not the best, on any platform and in any genre.  This is the game Star Wars fans have been waiting for since that old side-scrolling one on the NES.

The Early Game:
I never realized how irritating grinding was in other RPGs until I picked up this one.  Imagine eating generic pasta out of a box with Ragu sauce from a jar your whole life, and then going to your first Italian restaurant to discover they make their pasta in house and the red sauce is so wonderful you know you'll never be able to go back to Ragu.  I took the MMO grind for granted as the cost of doing business; Bioware took the MMO grind by the throat and told it to never show its face in this town again.

From the first minute, each of the game's eight basic classes has its own storyline, complete with unique cutscenes and a very believable feel.  The difference between playing a up-and-coming bounty hunter on Hutta and a Sith apprentice on Korriban is so pronounced, that to date I have eight different characters on the same server, four Empire and four Republic side.  The experience is so fun that I find myself *role playing with myself* in terms of which conversational decisions I choose and who I choose to help, for example my bounty hunter always remains loyal to his first employer until the contract is complete - it's just good business, after all.

The User Interface:
The UI is functional and fairly easy to use for people with previous MMO experience.  The beginner tips will help those of you new to the genre, but I'd still expect something of a learning curve.  The absence of macros and other other helpful features such as target of target is odd but not a deal-breaker.  Unlike other areas of the game, I felt like Bioware kept the UI pretty simple and did not attempt to redefine the standard in any way, in fact a lot of the default keybinds from World of Warcraft are the same, such as (P) to open your spellbook, etc.

Graphics:
The ""stylized realism"" look Bioware went for works out well.  SWTOR is less grainy and off-putting than Age of Conan, and less cartoonish than WoW.  I had considerable framerate issues at first, but I quickly discovered that if you simply turn shadows off entirely, you can amp up the other graphical options to High without real problems.  Unlike Peter Pan, I can function without a shadow, so whatever.

The Story-driven Experience:

When Bioware started ranting about bringing story-telling into MMOs, my first question was ""Why not just make it a single player RPG then?"".  They came through on that one big-time though.  The attachment you develop to your character has always been one of the big draws for role playing games, and the story-telling experience in SWTOR takes that to a new level.

The Companion System:
Again, something I wasn't crazy about when Bioware was explaining it during development, in practice the companion system really shines.  For one thing, the conversations and friendships your character develops with the companions are interesting and meaningful.  From a more mechanical perspective, it allows you to level with what would normally be a sub-optimal spec, such as healer or tank.

PVP:
Here, I have to take a break from congratulating Bioware on their success and temper my applause a bit.  As a long time PvPer on WoW, a former League of Legends addict, and general fan of sniping people in the head in BF3, fighting other players is a big part of gaming for me and, I'm guessing, for many of you.  SWTOR delivers a decent PvP experience, but so far it stands out as being much weaker than the other parts of the game.

There are currently three battlegrounds, only one of which allows for fighting your own faction.  On my server (and from what I hear, on most servers) the ratio of Imperials to Republic players is very skewed, so much so that my friends and felt compelled to reroll as Republic just so we could play all three battlegrounds equally and have more opportunities to do world PvP.  The same-faction battleground, a combat sport called ""Huttball"", is annoying both in its own right and because if your faction outnumbers the other on your server, it's what you'll be playing more often than not.

World PvP is okay, but here the companion system makes things kind of weird (there's no companions in the battlegrounds).  It's hard to review the world PvP because I've not yet figured out if having companions involved adds depth or just makes it messy and confusing.

The Crafting System:
Way better than most crafting systems in that it's not a huge pain.  This is offset by the limited usefulness of most of the possible professions at the moment, as you're not able to craft weapons or armor that are only usable by you.

Conclusion:
This game is amazing, and each world a joy to explore and experience.  I would recommend it without reservation to anyone who likes online games.","Got it in one, Bioware!",1326844800,9,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The joystick itself is tight without being so stiff that you can't move it through the full range of motion without upsetting the base.  The throttle has a nice smooth range of motion with forward and reverse and a ""dead"" spot for 0.

Gray,"Just five months after the schizophrenic Sonic Unleashed was released, the Sonic Team sweatshop has cranked out another game, Sonic and the Black Knight.  However, what was promised to be the improved, refined sequel to Sonic and the Secret Rings has turned out to be anything but.  Right now I'd take Secret Rings over any level in this game.

If Sonic Team had just taken the basic elements of Secret Rings and perfected them - better control and camera angles, less tedious missions, a more reasonable learning curve - they would have had a fantastic sequel that may have been the best return to form for Sonic that we've seen in nearly a decade.  However, the team has never seen a new gimmick that they didn't like so now we have Sonic the swashbuckler.  It could have been good if Sonic's speed had been maintained and if the Wii-remote waggle had been more precise.  But when you have to literally stop every few seconds, flick your wrist around like an idiot to swing your sword, and then jerk back into full motion again repeatedly, in EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, there is no chance to get a good momentum going, and the whole experience just becomes tedious.  No amount of good graphics - and this game does have very nicely done graphics - is going to save a game if its gameplay mechanics are inherently flawed.  Just like every 3-D Sonic game ever made, the camera has some major problems with jerkiness, getting stuck behind objects, or just plain not allowing you to see what's up ahead.  Side missions like stopping to give coins to townspeople, in which you have to brake completely just so you can do some quick-time button movements, are horrible.  The music is decent, a bizarre combo of 80's ""Sonic rock"" with medieval motifs.  The voice acting and terrible dialogue is what we have come to expect from Sonic.  And for the unbelievably slow, boring multiplayer game, well, the less that is said about that the better.

There have already been complaints by some Sonic fans for the seemingly excessive low scores some major game reviewing websites have given this game.  I think they, like many fans of the original Genesis Sonic games, are just frustrated.  It's like Sonic Team and SEGA can't, or won't, listen to the gaming community.  I understand that Sonic is a cash cow (or hog, I guess) for SEGA and they want to put him in as many games as possible, whether or not those games are suitable for market.  Don't they understand that if they took their time to make an excellent Sonic game that truly does reflect what made the franchise great in the 90s - the ecxiting and SIMPLE blend of speed and platforming - that they would be raking in ten times the amount of money they are now?  Nintendo only makes a proper Mario game once every five years or so because they want to get it RIGHT.  It's what keeps the franchise going.  SEGA and Sonic Team could take a lesson from this, and if they don't want to see their mascot fade away like a washed-up rock star, they better do it fast.","Another tired gimmick, another sub-par game",1236297600,4,,

*Taking place after the film ""Wanted,"" based on the graphic novel, you play Wesley Gibson and his father as they confront other factions of the Fraternity of assasins.

The Good Things
*The video/sound quality was much better than I expected.  It's still not as great as other games out there (like ""Kill Zone 2""), but it is still a pleasure to watch.
*Includes some in-game unlockable content.
*Controls are easy to master and intuitive.
*Gameplay is relatively easy and linear.  It's nothing terribly challenging, but offers the uniqueness of using slow-motion and bullet-curving powers.
*Level designs are good.  Everything has strong textures and details.  Some areas look as authentic as they should, and even includes some locales from the movie.
*Finally, you can use the cheat codes that were hidden in the ""Wanted"" special features of the DVD and Blu-Ray.  It's a bit of a marketing ploy, I know, but now my collection feels complete.
*The story is not bad, and seems to jive with both the movie and comic book well.
*Characters are good.  You can expect the same bad attitude that the movie had (but not quite as bad as the comic).  You also get to see more costumed villians around.
*Music is good (same as the movie).
*Has trophies.

The Bad Things
*No multiplayer.
*Had one or two graphical errors.
*Not for kids; rated M for bloody violence and lots of language.

The Questionable Things
*As said above, the gameplay is easy and linear, almost to the point where it offers very little challenge.  I don't mind, but it could be seen as overly simple or unoriginal.

At first, when playing the demo, I thought this was just another typical shooter with some horrid graphics.  In truth, though, the game has good graphics and the gameplay is fun enough.

I seem to remember Sears selling it for $70, which in retrospect seems like highway robbery even in the youth of videogames. It came with a cool poster though. I first was exposed to CT by renting it from Blockbuster. Some guy had renamed all the characters. I remember the guy renamed Magus to Doom. I bet that guy thought he was real cool. The first night I owned the game, I obsessively played it well past my bedtime. I had my dad print off a really long guide from work. He even put it in a binder for me. I took it to school and read it whenever I got the chance. Having repeatedly played it, some of the music made an impression on me, and now I sometimes listen to jazz.

The question is whether this game is just a meme, or if it stands the test of time.

I don't like JRPGs, so pardon me if I'm biased here. They stop you from exercising any creativity over the development of your characters for some reason. There have been times when I hated CT because I thought it was basically the precursor to visual novels, which I hate.

There are extremely few chances for role-playing. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, there are 2 major decisions that occur in this game, and you get blindsided by them, if you ask me. They're the most impactful parts because the game does tell a competent story, and your decisions are affecting characters whose drama you're already heavily invested in.

But CT does allow you to examine your party's stats, change equipment, decide what accessories to use. Actually, there's little scarcity when it comes to items until the latter part of the game. ""Tabs"" are a cool idea, especially considering there's a new game plus option, so you can give the main character all the Power Tabs in your first run, and then give them to someone else your second time through, if that's your thing. Accessories are the most interesting thing here because you never sell them, and they make a substantial impact on how your characters work. There's even one that puts a character into a permenant berserk state. You won't be able to use any of their ""techs"" but they hit much harder than before, and their turn comes around more frequently.

It's nice that you end up with a variety of characters to put in a party of 3. Some of them are magic-intensive, others are more melee-intensive. Some can heal, some can't. It's too bad that despite your chances to switch out this member for that, you have no idea what's going on in a dungeon beforehand. You just have to go inside and see what's up.

The boss fights generally make sense. None of them are beyond your comprehension within a few tries. Some of them have special weaknesses, should you choose to experiment. Gimmick is considered a dirty word these days, but I wish more of the bosses in this game were like puzzles. The final boss isn't much more complex than one of the bosses you meet earlier in the game. He, she, or it just hits a LOT harder and has a LOT more HP.

Nevertheless, you'll find challenging fights, and you'll need to use multiple techs and items to get through them.

If I had it my way, you'd have multiple success states in this game. For example, if you beat a boss in a certain way, you'd get more or less XP instead of simply making the game easier. The same goes for regular enemies. It would also be nice if it could somehow track your performance, however you'd like to measure that, and spit out a high score screen. Yes, this is an RPG, but it is a linear RPG. Yes, there are multiple endings, but there are a finite number of endings. It would be nice if you could challenge yourself over and over, which would extend the game's usefulness beyond the content itself.

At the end of the day, the game's presentation makes it pleasing to go through. Maybe even comfy. As far as JRPG stories go, it's a neat little story that, when you think about it, carries its theme in places you wouldn't expect. Every character has a single thing in common, which I won't spoil here, but I might say something in the comments, if someone asks.

What makes BAA such an amazing game is how simple it is to pick up and play. The controls are simple and the fighting system is engaging. I used to play a lot of video games when I was a young kid, but as I'm older, i don't want to play a game that takes forever to figure out where to go or figure out the control scheme. The best games out there are the ones that are simple to play and navigate. What makes BAA stand out is the high level of production values that contribute immensely to the Batman experience. The graphics and music take BAA to a whole new level of gaming excitement. The music is incredibly orchestrated and makes the gameplay experience that much more engaging. Plus, the iconic voices of MARK HAMMIL and KEVIN CONROY from the Animated Series make their entrance into Arkham. What also makes BAA such an amazing Batman experience is the level of detail put into the Batman characters as well as the gadgets and locales. The Batmobile, the batcave, Arkham, etc. is beautifully detailed. The reason why I like BAA better than other Batman expereiences because it is a TRUER Batman experience. Instead of the gravelly, pretentious voice of Christian Bale, you get the smooth natural sound of Kevin Conroy. Plus in BAA, you get to experience Batman as a martial artist. The experience of taking out 15 criminals and 2 juiced up monsters in one room is just an awesome bad ass experience that you don't get any where else. In the Dark Knight, you get limited and awkward fight scenes. Not only are the production values and control schemes excellent, but the level design is amazing as well. BAA incorporates a great mixture of fighting and stealth that does not feel contrived. The Stealth aspects of the BAA also surpass those of the Metal Gear Solid Franchise which is amazing in its own right. BAA makes the stealth aspect suspenseful, rewarding, and most importantly fun, whereas in other games it can be frustrating and cumbersome. Another great aspect of BAA is that the story is great, especially for a video game. ALthough the video game industry has provided for some great experiences, not many video games are able to convey a story that rivals that of movies and tv shows.

It's not a puzzle game, but you need to solve puzzles.  It's not a twitch game, but from time to time, the way you twiddle the triggers is everything.  It's not ultra-realistic, and yet physics is an important part of gameplay.

In Loco Roco 2, a world of cute creatures made from simple shapes has been overrun with some odd colorless creatures from another world.  They've corrupted the color with black blobs and it's up to you to put things right.  You play a cute little yellow blob that grows bigger as it finds things to eat.  Movement in Loco Roco 2 consists of using the shoulder buttons to tilt the world this way or that and make your blob hop up and down--and it comes down to timing the tiliting/sliding action with the hops to get the blob to go where you want it to.  Your cute little blob is made up of (and can break itself into) bunches of little blobs, and from time to time that is exactly how you have to get through parts of each level.  Levels vary enough to be interesting, with sliding on ice, bobbing on water, or slipping through pachinko-like tunnels in ""little-blob"" form enjoyable.

Everything seems simplistic on the surface, but it can get fairly complicated if you're one of those people who wants to experience it all:  hidden areas, minigames, alternate side goals and more are embedded in the game.  You can replay levels, and the levels can ""Level Up"" which apparently makes it easier for you to find more goodies.  You also find other characters who become playable as you go along, with slight differences in how they behave.

This colorful, simple-shape world is backed by a soundtrack reminiscent of Sesame Street:  it's very childlike and cheery.  While you're playing the game, it adds to the experience.  However, I've found that anyone *not* playing Loco Roco 2 who gets within earshot finds it annoying (and I can't imagine buying the soundtrack CD that's offered here and actively listening to it outside of the game).  Children will most likely enjoy this game, but smaller children who are just getting into gaming would probably have a hard time understanding some of what is expected of them:  they'd probably be more prone to tilting the PSP and expecting things to roll or slide than they would be able to figure out the shoulder-button mechanics.  I expect that the very small will enjoy watching big brother or sister (or mom or dad) while they play, as its Baby-Einstein graphics can make Loco Roco 2 almost hypnotic at times.

If you like a bit of puzzling and don't mind a bit of arcade button-mashing, Loco Roco 2 will provide you a gaming experience that strays outside of the mainstream.  Its content is definitely safe for children, and makes a nice break from the typical, ""you have bad guys, and you have to shoot/kill/explode/bop 'em on the head"" gameplay mechanic that permeates many games.  Its eccentric style may not be for everyone, and its soundtrack may overrun your tolerance for sweetness, but I think it's just part of an excellently-crafted package.

The only real disappointment is the first two Shinobi games are not included (only Shinobi III) and the classic titles that were cross-platform with the SNES are also not here. But you are getting an excellent collection of Genesis exclusives that will keep you busy for hours, so it's easy to forgive the omissions.

Also included in the game is a lot of unlockables, including video interviews with the game designers and other goodies, as well as arcade games like Zaxxon that completely floored me. Zaxxon was my favorite arcade game as well as the reason I had a Colecovison back in the 80's, so my nostalgia meter was definitely kicked into overdrive. The last thing I'll touch upon is the benefits of this game for achievement hunters. Several of the games support achievements and the majority of them are easy to obtain, such as 45 points for reaching level 11 in Vectorman 2, something you can do by entering a cheat code to get there instantly. Other games have simple objectives, such as survive a level without dying or reaching a certain number of points within a limited period of time. If achievements are your thing, this game is definitely worth picking up (not that the games aren't incentive enough).

Many of you reading this will belong to two different camps: those who experienced the Genesis back in the day and those who are too young but are curious about retro gaming. To both, this collection is an easy recommendation. These games come from a time when story, challenge and sheer fun were the main draw of a game, so don't let the primitive graphics and lack of modern tweaks discourage you. This collection is, simply put, a must-have.",The best bang for your retro gaming buck!,1288742400,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

This game provides a way for you to set up your own workout and weight loss routine.  It starts with a fitness test and you have options for choosing the length of time you want to exercise, how many days per week and what you want to accomplish.  You can use it for weight loss, core strength or flexibility.  You can also customize it for use with hand weights, an exercise ball or step bench if you have them.  Just trying it for a couple days of workouts it provides a good cardio workout and lots of good flexibility moves.  I'd have to say it's more strenuous than most of the Wii Fit exercises, many of which are more concentrated on balance than on cardio.  But the one thing I wish they would have included is use of the Wii balance board.  This seems like such a natural for this game and would have given feedback on your actual moves. As it is, this seems more like an exercise DVD in some ways than a Wii fitness game.

Still, it does have many features that are interactive and that set it apart from an exercise DVD that I enjoy.  You can choose from among 8 different places or environments to exercise, whatever suits your mood on a particular day.  And there's a good selection of music that you can choose to exercise to. To me that's a big thing.  Nothing is worse than having to exercise to music that you find annoying.  Everyone should be able to find something they like here.  And you can keep track of your progress.

Maya, your trainer gives you lots of encouragement and pushes you to achieve your goals.  I think being able to set your own goals and making a commitment to exercise and eat well is a very good way to lose weight or gain flexibility and core strength.  This game helps you to make that commitment and it gives you a way to measure your progress.  There are also a lot of different exercises, something for everyone and for every fitness goal.

The music is good and the graphics are fine, not exceptional, but not bad.  The instruction and demonstration of the exercises is very good and easy to follow.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I thought it missed a good chance at more interactivity by not including the balance board.",Get up off the couch and get fit!,1228348800,299,,

easy to use, looks way better than having four controllers lying around, charges them completely, easy to pop controllers in and out, convenient way to charge your mic (if its the official ps3 mic), takes up minimal space.

cons:
the mic charging stand is not built into device but plugs in via usb which is a good idea except on both of mine are quite loose, lights don't have an option to be turned off at all which is annoying if you sleep in the same room as this charger because the lights are quite bright.

Vanillaware has created the most beautiful 2D game that I have ever seen, Muramasa is one of those rare gems that only happens once. Everything is hand-drawn, playing this is like playing art. We all know this game looks amazing, so I will focus more on the gameplay with this review.

This is a game for anyone really, the hardcore action fans will enjoy themselves and casual gamers will be able to finish it without too much struggle. Muramasa is a straight ahead 2D sidescroller, you run through the map and take out the enemies as you encounter them. There are secret items to collect and NPCs to speak with. You can initially start with 2 game modes, Muso (normal) and Shura (hard). In Muso mode you can level up and obliterate most enemies without trouble, Shura is more action oriented and it's MUCH harder...but way more fun if you ask me. You can switch between game modes on the fly too, nice. You can select 1 of 2 characters, Kisuke and Momohime. Both play exactly the same but the story and bosses that you encounter are entirely different. You have to equip 3 swords at a time and eventually you can forge your own blades. After you defeat each boss in each character's story you have the ability to forge more blades. In total there are 108, for your first play through you will not be able to forge all of them. After completing the main story with each character, both characters can use all blades, you can then backtrack and finish bonus dungeons to achieve a 100% game. Based on the blades that you equip you will have a different ending, 3 endings for each character. You also have the ability to cook items to restore health and add bonuses to your stats, it's actually really fun! The voice acting is the original Japanese, some may not like this but I prefer it this way. The music is excellent as well. I think that English voices would have ruined the beauty of this game, that's just my opinion. If you are at all familiar with Japanese lore then you will LOVE this game, if not you'll probably enjoy it just as much. Both characters have a great story, deep and philosophical. I couldn't be happier with this game, I knew it was going to be great but I'm truly amazed. 20+ hours for a complete playthrough, I've already started over again too.

Sometimes we play games that are not multi-player or via internet. We don't always need the mic getting in the way, so it is nice it is detachable.

Bioware has leveraged its own storytelling penchant and style to create a gaming experience that is truly immersive and wide in scope.  Endless storylines and dialogue await the curious player, coupled with a deep lore set, and the ability to cultivate long-term relationships with other NPCs (as we have seen in other Bioware titles such as Jade Empire).

The combat system is a hybrid between turn-based and real-time, and allows the player to adjust on the fly depending on the encounter and situation -- if you like, you can control each character's every move in an encounter, or you can set tactics to allow them to follow a script without being micromanaged, depending on your playstyle preference and the difficulty of the encounter.  The result is a satisfying, customizable experience which allows players to scale their approach to combat depending on context.

The game will likely not appeal to fans of the Diablo style of RPG, because this, as a Bioware game, is heavily based on storyline and dialogue -- probably more than any other Bioware game to date.  But for fans of Bioware's approach to the genre, this title is an instant classic.  Easily 60 hours or so on a first playthrough, with replayability based on different character archetypes and origin stories (hence the reference in the title), and a few downloadable content additions as well, this game will appeal to anyone who liked Bioware's previous titles, such as KOTOR or Jade Empire.",An instant classic!

Our old charger had to plug into a USB port to charge so it needed to stay near the Wii, and this one plugs into the wall which is much nicer. Beware that the packaging is typical heat-sealed plastic which even when carefully opened basically explodes the contents over whatever surface you are working on - and I'm convinced the size of all the parts also increases by about 10% so you can't get them back in the package. It would therefore be a bit cumbersome to return this unit to a bricks and mortar store but with Amazon you can just shove it all into a box and be done with it (I had to do that with my first unit, see below).

The batteries and color-coded battery covers are easy to install and the unit looks nice with the controllers in it or out of it. Not sure why the back covers are color coded, but they are. Controllers need to have any safety sleeve removed before placing them in the unit, and it is sometimes a bit finicky about placement of the wrist strap but no real surprise there. You can leave the wrist strap on for charging, which is the main thing. The lights on the front of the unit are very bright, could be distracting in a dark room playing games but of course one could simply remove all 4 controllers to solve that issue. Lights are blue and turn green when fully charged. Batteries hold a charge well.

The first unit I got failed to charge anything in the 3rd slot so it was returned / replaced with no problems. I waited for a couple weeks after getting the new one before posting this review - and it is working without a hitch.

Gameplay is amazing and everything responds as it should. I only had one problem in the whole game, where I had actually gotten stuck in a wall, when I was hit by a grenade, and flew backwards.

The story between the levels is equally repetitive, there are so many ""rooms that need to be organized"", it gets boring.

Also the end, i.e. successful completion of the game is not sufficiently distinguished. I was in fact confused whether I had actually finished the game.

They are being made according to the limits of production in relation to demand. Madcatz has never stopped making these sticks. This is perhaps the most unbiased review you will read... so listen up.

Oh, and don't bother paying anything more than retail. That's a joke.

Anyways, to the review...

If you pay anything more than $90 for this stick, you will be severely disappointed. Not only will you be required to void the warranty on the controller to prevent the joystick from breaking -- but replacing it with a new one will bring the cost up to near 'Tournament Edition (149.99)' prices.

What you are paying for is labor and an arcade stick box -- REMEMBER THAT. Quality arcade controllers run from $100 to $200 because of the labor involved, the inner circuitry/wiring, and the cost of the parts. For $80 you are getting a stupidly good deal on a box, controller functionality, and labor. A control pad for any system will run you about $50, so you are only paying $30 for the cost of high quality wiring, additional materials (obviously, the stick is big) and additional labor. It is a fantastic deal.

Here's what you are getting pretty much for free: The joystick and buttons. The parts inside are good for anyone new, but they will not last without your help. I'm talking a month or so max without personal modifications; with the joystick itself lasting you from a day to a few weeks(they are defective, check Madcatz' official site for info. They mention a small amount only, but I can guarantee you will not be risking it with $80 worth of equipment or more). IF YOU CAN FIX IT YOURSELF, AND DON'T FEAR OPENING IT UP AND VOIDING THE WARRANTY -- THE PARTS ARE REASONABLE. THE FIX IS EASY.

I have fixed about 20 sticks for people since these have been released all with the same problem (more have brought them in after it was too late to fix). Don't get shafted.

Replacing the parts inside is quick and easy however slightly costly. I don't recommend this unless you are absolutely sure you need to. This controller however, was built and sold for you to replace the parts inside. The craftsmanship and wiring are all 100% newbie friendly. You can know nothing about electronics and replace the parts -- all you need is the ability to turn some screws and pull some plugs. At best you will be paying $50 in addition as well as waiting weeks for the stores to restock their parts.

Like I said earlier, remember that you are buying a BOX and LABOR not a reliable Arcade Controller. That means that whatever you tack on above the price of this controller is simply giving it away to the seller, and a Box and Labor are definitely not worth anything more than what the retail on this controller is! The box is beautiful and is designed well. The quality of the wiring and the actual controller functionality for your specific system are fantastic. The actual buttons and joystick are DEFECTIVE!

UPDATE! 2/19/2012:
It has come to my attention that people are still interested in this item! I had thought interest would wane after production stopped for this particular model, but it seems I was wrong. When I wrote this review (very aggressively apparently), it was nearly a week after release and during a resurgence of fighting games. People were buying arcade sticks in such quantities that every brand and type was sold out! If that wasn't bad enough, these controllers were defective outside of the box. A washer malfunction caused the joystick to carve into the PCB (and permanently destroy the circuit) right out the box. The buttons were also prone to sticking. My personal stick suffered from both these problems, and I had to repair these issues for several others. This was a disaster, and I really wanted to stress the fact that what people were purchasing would stop working within a week or so. The silver lining was the fact that the going rate for an arcade stick box, wiring, and control pad to modify were far more expensive than this device! Not to mention the labor involved with the chance of failing. It was a beauty of engineering on the inside, but the inputs were terrible. That isn't the case anymore!

I purchased a PS3 version of this stick almost a year later to gut and make a dual console stick, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that all the problems had been fixed! In fact, the stick felt much better than before. I used it stock for a few weeks off and on, and from what I can tell Madcatz resolved their error. The buttons didn't gain any extra sensitivity, but they are still good for beginners.

Today, the latest version of this stick is the WWE Brawl stick. You shouldn't have any issues with it! I don't prefer the art, but buy in confidence! This stick is still beautifully engineered on the inside for easy upgrading. I would invest in this one rather than a similar priced Hori simply because of the simplicity of the wiring inside Madcatz' product. Hori sticks in this price range have parts soldered into place onto circuit boards, so modifying them takes extra work and materials!",Unbiased Review...

3,False,"09 25, 2013",A20R03APZ2ITKR,B001NJMMHG,PantsuPanic,"In every long running series of video games there's often one title that players hold in highest esteem.  Well it just so happens in the eternal Dragon Quest franchise, number 5 is often noted as the crme de la crme by ardent fans.  The number one reason cited is Dragon Quest V's (DQV henceforth) ""amazing story"".  But before I get to that, let's break this game down into modular criticisms.

Graphics:  DQV on the DS is largely graphically the same as DQIV was on the DS.  Quite a few assets are recycled, as is the game's engine itself.  Luckily there have been a few small upgrades to DQV's engine, such as hues changing as day turns to night and back again, as well as the ability to zoom scenes outward to a bird's eye view.  The backgrounds consist of simple 3D elements but run smoothly, whereas characters and monsters all are 2D sprites.  The highlight of the graphics however are the wonderful enemy animations, fluid and quite lively they spice up the otherwise rote combat.

Music: DQV's soundtrack is built upon symphonic pieces composed from sampled instruments.  This approach often works well, and many of the songs here are perky and uplifting.  Unfortunately many of the songs here are also lifted from previous entries in the series, leaving only a few surprises.  And while the tunes are nice as a whole, there's not enough variety.  By the end of the game you'll be tired of hearing the same town, dungeon, and battle music ad nauseam.

Gameplay:  There's an old adage that says ""if you've played one DQ you've played them all"".  Well based on my limited experience with the series (I've finished DQI GBC and DQIV DS before this), I would say that's not entirely untrue.  The battle system especially is nearly identical to DQIV, with the exception of being able to get monsters to join your party (randomly).  This feature is often cited as innovative on DQV's behalf, but it isn't really considering Digital Devil Story on the Famicom allowed you to do this in 1987, years before DQV adopted the idea.  Also concerning battling, you will be grinding ferociously in DQV if you want to see the end.  Literally in most hostile areas you will get in a battle every 3-5 seconds of walking.  That means a simple dungeon that would take you two minutes to walk through takes two hours thanks to incessant battling.  Luckily you can put your party on auto battle and turn up the battle message speed to fast, which greatly helps ease the pain of the incessant grind. Lastly I will say DQV is a very easy game.  The only tangibly challenging encounter for this player was the final form of the final boss, who I still managed to best in my first encounter.  And that was with no strategy guide or cheats.  To be honest the most fun I had with DQV was traversing its numerous T'n'T boards.  These are special places in the game that are their own sort of dice & board games where you can win special gear.  I would have enjoyed an entire DQ game based on this concept.

Story / Plot:  I've saved this aspect for last because it was so disappointing for me.  I had been lead to believe by incessant internet opinions that DQV has an astounding plot.  Well that is simply not true in the opinion of this player who's been into JRPGs since the late 80s.  The biggest deal with DQV's plot is that it's based on family.  You start off as a kid, grow up, get married, have your own kids, and eventually take down the big vague baddie with your family in tow.  Well this might actually mean something if any of your family had deep character development.  Sadly, that's just not the case.  I could not tell you what my wife's favorite food is, or what my kids' enjoy doing in their leisure time, for example.  That's because your family are cardboard cutouts left completely undiscovered thanks to your protagonist being mute.  Dialogue is always one way, as your main player says nothing.  When you are given the option to converse, it's only via a binary question mid-conversation that means nothing at all.  If you choose the incorrect answer, the game will ask you over again until you choose the answer it wants.  What's the point of giving this illusory choice then?  As far as raising my children in DQV was concerned, the only real influence I had as a father was deciding what color hair they would have.  This is a joke considering you could also have children in Phantasy Star III but largely influencing their physical/combative traits based on who you married.  And PSIII came out two years before DQV, for the record!  In the end, the plot of DQV is simple and totalitarian, pushing the idea of familial bonds upon the player but never making the player actually care about the family in tow.  I mean, why should you care that your mother is imprisoned when you know practically nothing about her?  And of course the final boss was some vapid monster who's impetus you knew little about until it showed up out of nowhere and wanted to destroy the world.  Well I have seen deeper stories not only in older JRPGs than DQV, but in children's novels for Pete's sake. My one bit of praise is that despite DQV's threadbare narrative, I will admit the DS version's localization is top notch.  The many NPCs you encounter throughout the game come to life thanks to the colorful translation.

Overall:  As you can tell by now I was not enamored with DQV.  Rather I found the entire experience to be over-hyped and honestly a slog at times.  It took me 37 hours to finish DQV, and I was well tired of it by the time I hit 20 hours in.  Having to force yourself to finish a game is never a good sign.  If DQV's plot had actually been gripping, that wouldn't have been the case.  Rather those extra 17 hours weren't full of riveting narrative as I'd been led to believe, but rather endless grind.  At the finish line I walked away feeling DQV was merely a ""decent"" JRPG.  Whether you feel DQV's story is amazing or not largely depends on how old you are when you play it, and how many other RPGs you've already experienced.  For this weathered veteran Dragon Quest V was simply an unmemorable notch on the sword.  Another entry on the list of overrated JRPGs I've finished that I simply can't understand the collective fervor for.",Dragon Quest V - Fans Of The Hyperbolic Opine,1380067200,3,,

3,True,"04 12, 2012",A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B001O2J036,Moviedude,"Darkest of days is an interesting little endeavor- a first person war simulator that delivers battlefields with hundreds of combatants and lush, organic landscapes. The game is spread across several time periods, as the player takes the role of a time-traveling policeman of sorts. Supposedly KIA at Little Bighorn, you are in fact rescued from certain death to right errors in history. Of course there are rival time travelers, and in a fun twist, under extreme circumstances full war with futuristic weapons will erupt in the midst of historic battles with catastrophic results.

The centerpiece of Days is clearly the American Civil War. The Civil War levels are the most colorful and detailed, the most exciting, and boast the largest, most epic battles. The other time periods seem more shallow and tacked on- I strongly suspect this game started life as a Civil War FPS and took on a veneer of sci-fi out of worries that 9 hours of reloading muskets and crawling through muddy cornfields might alienate players. It's a shame because to my knowledge there has NEVER been a Civil War FPS, while there are only a bazillion time travel ones.

Oh well.

Even now, 3 years out from its release, the huge armies that appear in Days are impressive to see, and while spreading a game's AI power across that many enemies at once makes them individually as dumb as bricks (single enemy soldiers will often stand there obliviously as you jump up and down in front of them) as a whole army the games enemies and AI allies behave with terrifying, antlike complexity. The outdoor environments look good too, with tons of murky water and foliage everywhere, although textures are shockingly low-rez and artificial structures don't look very good.

All in all, Darkest of Days is an interesting tech demo that never spun up into a genuinely great game. It's worth it for civil war buffs who will delight in the single-shot weapons and clouds of powder smoke over the battlefield, but these same history fans may also be turned off when the Battle of Antietam is invaded by space commandos from the future.

PROS
-Epic war on a scale few other FPSs can match, especially in the Civil War levels
-Responsive, tight controls
-Smart use of shaders and other effects to create futuristic light shows amid realistic period settings
-Well-modeled, realistically behaving weapons

CONS
-Engine delivers lots of popup and doesn't look too hot
-Individual enemies are about as smart as bags of doorknobs
-Dopey time-travel elements ruin a perfectly good game about the Civil War
-Dialog and voice acting that may be even worse than Maelstrom

The padding on the ears and top are still both in great shape and show no signs of wear and tear. The microphone attached with this headset is good for a headset and nobody has complained about it so far (I spend a lot of time in Skype calls and TeamSpeak servers so I talk via mic everyday.)
The 7.1 Surround Sound is really good on this headset and in games such as CS:GO it definitely gives me an edge while playing as it allows me to hear the enemy and react accordingly before they can.

After reading various reviews, I somewhat reluctantly decided to try these G35's out.  The price was 1/2 of what I paid for the Speedlink's, but I was concerned about these being USB headphones which meant that they wouldn't be using my quality SB sound card. Frankly I needn't have worried.  These headphones are absolutely tremendous for gaming and easily beat out my much more expensive Speedlink's in terms of positional audio.  Besides testing it out with the demo, which had me looking all over the room it was that accurate, I have also used them in Batman Arkham Asylum.  Thundering sound that absolutely transforms the game even coming from a previous 5.1 setup (the G35's are 7.1).  I cannot say enough about these headphones for gaming.  I also tested these with various forms of music and for that they are good but not exceptional.

Installation was very simple with the included CD which automatically went out and got the latest drivers from Logitech. The control panel is very simple to use for basic tone adjustments as well as programming the side buttons and any voice effects you may want.  My only gripe is that they don't appear to allow you to disable the side buttons.  I really don't have a need for them and find it somewhat easy to accidentally bump them which then brings up programs you didn't want.  This, however, is a minor issue.

If you are a gamer looking to get great positional audio at a tremendous price then these headphones are definitely for you.  For pure music I'd look elsewhere, but one likely would anyway as surround sound equipped headphones (which you can disable and should for music) aren't intended primarily for music use.

Update: After using the headset for about a month, I do have some updated points.  First, I have found that over longer gaming sessions this headset can get uncomfortable.  They press quite a bit and I found my self readjusting them to try and get some relief.  The Speedlinks I mentioned earlier could be worn for hours on end with no discomfort.  If you are playing in short bursts it may not be an issue, but if you have extended sessions then these things do get quite uncomfortable.  A second point relates to the mic light and support.  The microphone has a little red light on it that defaults to ""on when muted"".  There is a setting in the software that enables you to turn this light off at all times.  Unfortunately this setting does not save and thus on reboot it goes back to ""on when muted"" while all the other presets do save their settings.  I emailed Logitech about this, but their support is horrendous.  It  has taken at least a week to get replies from them and their replies are extremely basic.  After a week they suggested I reinstall the software (wow, it took you guys a whole week to come up with that gem?)  When that didn't work, it took them another week to reply that I should try it on another computer.  At this rate it will be months before we even get so far as to suggest trying a different USB port!  Laughable support.  Overall I still consider this a great headset, and the light issue while annoying isn't a deal killer, but the comfort is a disappointment.

3,True,"11 7, 2010",AY85D95X14Q17,B001P2M546,Sir Joe,"I haven't finished this game yet.  But so far it has been enjoyable. I only regret that my video card isn't well supported.  When I first started the game at low settings, it ran sluggishly, and eventually crashed.  I had to turn off everything that I could, and still it crawled. I finally had to reduce the resolution to about half of what my computer can normally handle, and even then it drops in frame-rate noticeably when I try to cover large areas of land or when I'm looking at a particularly detailed environment. And it starts to crawl again anytime there are more than a dozen or so enemies on the screen.

So far as the gameplay is concerned, it can be a bit clumsy at times, but it's still playable.  I would like it if my minions had better AI routing.  When I try to send them at a target that's around a corner, or behind a barrier that they have to go around, they have the tendency to just run up to the obstacle, and then turn around stupidly.  They don't automatically trash everything around them when you send them to attack crates and stuff, which I suppose is a good thing and a bad thing, depending on what you're trying to accomplish. I like that the upgrade system is a bit more detailed than in the first one, but Life Force collection can be a pain without the Arena.  I love subjugating local populations to do my bidding, but it's kind of tedious to get them all. I also think it's nice that you can resurrect fallen minions.  This is useful if you don't feel like going through the process of leveling up fresh minions every time you lose a few.  And the Browns seem a bit more resilient than in the first game, always a plus. I think I've only lost a couple dozen, but I haven't gotten very far.

Overall, there are some things I like about it more than the original, and there are other things that I dislike. The First Overlord was less demanding on my graphics card, which was one strike against Overlord 2, but I honestly expected that much.  In case you're wondering, I'm currently using an Nvidia 7300GT, it has 512MB of RAM which I thought would be plenty, but I guess there's a lot more to accommodating this game than just the Video Memory. The rest of my system meets or exceeds the recommended specifications. If you're going to buy this game, I would highly recommend getting a supported video card and making sure you meet all the recommended requirements, because it's kind of a resource hog.

I like Tekken but im not obsessed with it so this review will be as un-biased as possible. So I pop Tekken in and to no surprise Im introduced to some beautiful FMV. Namco has always been awesome with FMV so don't expect anything less then spectacular on that front. I get to the main screen and theres campiagn, online mode, offline mode, options, mainly the basics. Whats cool is like SFIV it shows your stats, such as how many points you have (to buy item to customize your characters) your win/loss record and things of that nature. The campign mode is kind of clunky when you fight and you can overkill enemies unless you press the 'switch target' button you will continue to pummel an enemy that might even be dead. But campign is a GREAT way to get points! But enough with campaign, lets get to the good stuff. Once your on the character select screen your greeted with 40 playable characters to start. Choose your character choose the stage (when in practice mode) and there is a slight load time but i don't think its as bad as people are making it out to be. I was waiting to be blown away by some spectacular graphics. And well I wasnt. Not that the graphics are bad, they're good but Soul Calibur IV has the one up in that area (maybe its because of all the content they couldn't have better graphics, i don't know). But im not going to 'downgrade' it because of the graphics, they're good, just not spectacular. Combos and moves are pretty easy to do, even on the 360 controller surprsingly enough. Juggles are also easy it shouldnt be difficult for any newbie to get 2-3 hits before their oppenent hits the ground. Whats weird is on some characters it shows that theres a combo in the 'command' menu but doesnt show how to do it? you can watch it being done, but maybe you have to figure out how to do it?? I don't know, i it mean shouldnt be too hard to figure out but thought that was odd. I played online a little bit with my bro and the load times were pretty good plus no lag at all. I checked out character customization a bit and there is quite a bit you can customize. From different outfits, to hair, accessories, etc. Im not quite sure if its as in-debth as Soul Calibur in terms of color changes and body type, but it does have more items available to customize your character with. The fighting doesnt feel quite as smooth as Soul Calibur either.

Crysis original does not have 5 activations on their DRM, but was lacking in gameplay. It had some really awesome moments and was just waiting for an expansion pack to come and better it.

Crysis warhead had intense action in awesome environments coupled with highly detailed levels and more character personality, but it also has the nasty draconian DRM known as securom. This means that you cannot resell the game when you're done, nor can you buy one copy and play LAN games. If you have a little brother that wants to join you, or a dad and brother, expect to pay full price per seat.

If you're creative and have trustworthy friends, you can lend crysis warhead to a friend just fine, which is how I played it. There are many less breathtaking moments, and stealth is no longer your priority, but you can't just blindly shoot places up.

Unfortunately, because of piracy IN RESPONSE TO the anti-piracy/DRM measures, crytek has decided to compromise the quality and integrity of their games and work on porting their next crysis/cryengine games to console. The difference is immense, and Crysis is as good as it will get for PC gamers as far as utilizing system resources for at least another 6 months.

Pros:
-Very awesome physics
-Very awesome graphics that make console graphics fanboys cry
-Some interesting gameplay dynamics
-For an FPS in this day and age, interesting AI

Cons:
-Downright nasty DRM measures on warhead and wars.
-Psuedo-open environments, you are on a linear path, always.
-Exploration is rarely rewarded when it can be done
-Developer has added injury to insult, and after alienating most of its PC customers claimed that the piracy is too much for them. Sales numbers at the time were 1.5 million copies sold, 350,000 copies downloaded. Sales numbers now are 4.5 million copies sold, 800,000 copies pirated.
-Sequels will be using console-ified graphics and gameplay that won't be worth your time. For now Crysis has an interesting storyline told wonderfully by the game engine, but this will change.

The Bad: Can't blow up small objects? unbalanced difficulty, hunting for things in the campaign detracts from experience, very few multiplayer modes

Ahhh...the tired old FPS genre. Everyone loves it and then everyone hates it. What more can developers do to change the FPS genre to make it interesting? Better graphics? Better sounds? More realistic AI? Realistic physics? Less linear? Keep the linearity? More vehicles? Better story? The list goes on and on, and the answer is yes to all of the above.

Bad Company 2 is a sequel of the first, but the first game was pretty forgettable. You play as a squad of four soldiers who were military rejects and must earn their freedom or face the slammer. They are sent into Africa and other parts of the world to find some sort of scalar weapon that the Russians found from Japan and are using it for global dominiation. Not something we haven't seen before, but the squad has great characters that you'll love and hearing their banter is enough to keep playing.

A lot of people are comparing Bad Company 2 to Modern Warfare 2 and if I were to pick the better game? Bad Company 2 for single player and realism, and Modern Warfare 2 for multiplayer, but then again I'm not comparing the two so let's get down to it. The first thing you will notice is how real Bad Company 2 feels more so than any other shooter so far. The sounds are just amazing with the sound of fire echoing off caverns, the sounds of you reloading echoing in a building, the pinging of bullet shells hitting the floor, everything sounds like it would in life and is placed accordingly unlock most (if not all) shooters real or not. The foilage looks real and everything blows up. You can blow pretty much anything up in the game with anything you can get hold of. This is also used in game play when getting around turrets that you can't shoot through. Find some red barrells and blow the building up, then have it collapse on everyone below it. This goes for radio towers, telephone poles, and large trees. Then again it's pretty stupid when you can blow apart small objects like trash cans, chairs, or cardboard boxes, so its very strange.

The weapon selection in the game is great, and you get all your real world guns and they fire like they should. The guns feel powerful, and everything about shooting feels dead on. Gone, however, is the whole healing thing and instead you just hide in cover to heal. Another element stripped is finding the gold bars, but instead M-COM stations that you blow up, and finding weapons. The M-COM stations are hard to find, and I don't know where all the hidden weapons could be, but they're there for people who like that stuff. I personally hate finding crap in shooters like this since it detracts from the experience and pulls you out. Other than that though the game is paced nicely and flows just right.

There are some elements that haven't been down before like the whole blowing up everything in your path (in an FPS anyways) and there's even one level where you will freeze to death if you don't find shelter fast. This level has you knifing doors open as you race down a hillside. There some epic vehicle sections (that hasn't been done before), but there is one level that isn't linear that has three checkpoints and you can choose which ones you want to do first. The opening level is even from WWII in Japan so the game is full of surprises and is a blast to play.

When it comes to multiplayer the game is solid with three modes of play, but my favorite is Rush. Like in the original game you have an attacker and defender side on a huge map (this one supports 64 players). You have five different classes to choose and you can customize them as you please. There are 3 ""perks"" that you can use at a time, but they must be unlocked and this takes awhile. The multiplayer is fast, intense, and fun with lots of vehicles zooming around, everything blowing up, and people just being crazy.

My last words here must be how amazing the game looks. Probably being the best looking shooter around it looks great technically, but has no artistic style and is just ""real life"" type of stuff, so its not for everyone. If you want a really amazing shooter to play and are bored of Modern Warfare 2 pick up Bad Company 2 because its one hell of a ride.

LIMITED EDITION: If you pick up the game anyone soon you can still get the limited edition that has 6 multiplayer unlocks and entitles you to upcoming maps for free. A deal?

When I first started playing, I revived people, dropped medpacks, manned/assisted and repaired tanks etc. etc. I spawned on my squadmates when I got shot and was back in the action. On top of that I spotted enemies hitting the select button, which usually my squadmates and myself attacked and received a kill. This game not only is user friendly, it also has great sound and sound effects. A couple of weeks ago, my PSN friends and myself helped each other out to get the Platinum award by allowing us to use the repair tool to get the dentist award, get killed by 5 friends etc. We did this because we decided that we would move onto Medal of Honor.
That didn't work out for us.

The message I am trying to give is that this game is what my friends and myself want more of. Medal of Honor plays like COD4, without all the fun diverse classes. This game requires teamwork and skill.  Finally, my friends and myself are looking forward to purchasing any downloadable content for BBC2. ;-)

After playing through twice, I sold it and reserved the Game of the Year Edition. I found myself almost going through withdraw after selling it and waiting for the release of the Game of the Year Edition. I've clocked over 160 hours on this game.

Graphics are really well done for just how large this game is. The person models and faces are really good looking and have a lot of detail. The ""Capital Waste Land"" looks amazing and so does all the DLC. The game has some hiccups with frame rate and texture pop-in, but that can easily be forgiven, given the scope of the game. There are times when using the V.A.T.S system where my view was obstructed, but it's the first of its kind.

Game play is pretty well thought out. I did end up having a couple problems with falling through the map; getting stuck in certain areas and freezing, but it wasn't too bad for all the hours put into this game.

Story is pretty good. I found myself really drawn into every story and side mission I did. I really felt like people were living their lives around me as I played. I'm not an RPG type of person but this game really made me realize how great an RPG can be. There were LOTS of choices to be made in this game and not all of them were easy. Even though I went through twice, I couldn't see myself being the bad guy, it was just too evil.

DLC additions were well worth the extra cost. My favorite had to be Mother Ship Zeta, due to me being a sci-fi lover. The only one that felt out of place was Operation Anchorage, which felt like Call of Duty. Point Lookout almost feels like a small game in itself, offering a completely different decent sized area to explore. The Pitt was a nice addition that added more hard choices and a good look at what happened to Pittsburg. Broken Steel was a very welcomed addition that extended the level cap and kept the action going after the end of the game. Overall, all but Operation Anchorage would have been worth the $10 that they were being sold for on Live, but you can get them all in this.

Overall, I can't say enough about how amazing this game is. Yes, it has some problems, but those can easily be forgiven when you see just how amazing everything is. There is easily over 100 hours of play here with just one play through. The game deserves a place in history as one of the best games ever made.

The first had a real ""last-gen"" feel to it, graphically, and what I felt to be pretty horrible playability overall.

Not so with Bound in Blood.  Red Dead Revolver was, in my mind, the best western game made thus far, and I think Bound in Blood now takes the title. (of course, RDR was PS2, so thats like comparing different model years for cars, but progress marches on nonetheless).  Bound in Blood has pays strong homage to the Western genre, and like Western movies, a lot can go wrong, but they do it right.  Bandits, deserts, multiple Indian tribes, authentic weaponry, FPS shooting and canoe/horseback/wagon play...coupled with a strong storyline and pretty decent voice acting, they really nailed it, making one the most enjoyable games I've played on the PS3.

Graphically, its high-def texturing and epic panoramas of the Wild West.  From eerie ghost towns, vertigo-inducing mining areas, and one-horse hamlets straight out of Deadwood, they paint the picture in 1080p glory.  I'm a details guy, and I extra appreciated the believability of the swirling mists, the small desert whirlwinds, and the shimmering heat effects from the desert valleys.  They didn't have to do it, but it really adds depth.  Heck, even when you click on pause, the game freezes in an old-west sepia-toned pic.

Music is strong, game mechanics are pretty solid overall, and reoccuring events like showdowns and kick-down-the-door shootouts with your brother are a lot of fun.  Again, being able to play the game through twice with only small parallels was something added that didn't have to be there but I think adds tremendous replay value.

Frequently when your expectations are low, you aren't dissapointed, and I went into Bound in Blood with low expectations, but had a great experience.  If you like Westerns, this is a must-own, on your shelf beside your Blu-Ray copy of Outlaw Josie Wales and Tombstone.

This is the first video game I have ever played that I can honestly say I enjoyed every moment from the first minute, until the surprisingly moving ending.  I was a huge fan of Read Dead Revolver, and was amazed at this follow-up.

Here are the good things:
-  Unbelievibly large world, with things to do in every corner.
-  The story line is second to NONE.  I couldn't beleive the ending, and can't wait to see where the next game takes us.
-  Game is not too easy, not too hard, and always entertaining.
-  Details and graphics are unbelievable.  I knew this game was on a different level when the camera angle slipped behind an armoire cabinet for an instant as I looked around a remote room now where special in Mexico.  My position in the room was odd, and the camera was never meant to point at what I saw.  I saw a design on the back of the trim.  They took the time to add a design to the back of a piece of wood no one would probably ever see.  This is a small example of the detail of this game.  Simply amazing!
-  The characters will draw you in, they are special indeed.
-  Game controls are easy and effective.
-  You could play this game for ever if you wish, it's that deep.  I have days and days of play time logged, and I still have things I want to go back and do in the game.

The not-so-good:
-  Sometimes they drop a person who needs help in the middle of a critical mission.  Giving you the choice to let the person suffer, or complete your mission on time.  Doesn't happen often, but it does happen.
-  I liked the showdown mode on Red Dead Revolver better than this version.  This version lacked the color indicators showing how deadly a certain shot it i.e. green on a person's arm/wrist, orange in the stomach, red in the heart or head.  I liked that.
-  Some of the side missions to help people in need are quite repetitive, they could have used about 10 more different small side missions and made a lot more variety.
-  On RARE occasions there were glitches.  A chair 5' in the air, while a person sat on nothing below.  I also saw a few times where the grass and ground didn't load and I would be standing on ""blankness"".  Too rare to affect game play.
-  There's only one problem with the story-line area.  Not even our hero John Marston would help some of the people with their crazy requests.  But, there are some of these crazy requests that once you get to the final part...will pull at your heart strings.  Example: the guy heading to California, and the stranger who knows a bit too much about John and won't give John his name.

This is one game that the price should never go down on, and I can't believe I am saying that.

4,True,"06 1, 2010",A169CJ2NJQYIM6,B001SH7YMG,007,"This is a very solid game. I have to say I am pleased that somebody finally did an open world game based in the old west. The scenery is simply breathtaking, as is the audio. From bullet richochets to some awe-inspring thunder, the game really delivers on those levels. The graphics are great aside from a few small things. For example, hair and beards look terrible, but otherwise its very pleasing.

I like the main character. Being a Rockstar game, I really expected them to make him a total cliche, but he is actually a personable chap.

I haven't quite finished the game yet, but the length seems to be pretty good and the multiplayer options are pretty nice, although I would have liked to see them tied to the single player game a bit more. You end up doing the same things over again in multiplayer for your challenges, but not a big deal.

The Cons:

Some graphical glitches and freezes.
Poor autosave feature.

I would also have liked it to be more of an RPG in terms of being able to ""build"" your character. There is no leveling of any kind, and no way to make build your character around your style of play.

Quests seem pretty few and far between for the first half of the game, but after you hit Mexico they really pick up.

Lack of instruction on many things. Dueling is one example.

The way that they kick the game off was pretty, well, stupid. Marston goes to the fort and tries to get the guy to turn himself in. Fair enough...but when the guy says NO, Marston casually goes for his gun and gets shot. If our hero is really that stupid, perhaps he shouldn't be our hero?

Quests seem very disconnected and random. Its not a huge deal, but after playing some of the other RPG's like Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age, it really made it stand out.

One other complaint I have is the ""bounty"" feature in multiplayer. There is no progression of effort to take your character down like we saw with the GTA series. For example, it doesn't matter if you have a bounty of $20 or $2,000, they really don't try any harder to take you out. Also, when you are in a posse, your bounties go up individually rather than collectively, which I found odd. So if you have a big posse of 8 buddies and you want to hit the $5,000 mark, you are in a for a very long wait because you all have to share the guys they send at you, which like I said never increases.

Enemy AI is laughable sometimes, especially in multiplayer. The idiot enemies will pile up outside the wall of a town and just sit there like morons.

I didn't own a racing game for the Wii yet, so the idea of buying ExciteBots was very tempting (especially since it's a Nintendo title).  However, I managed to resist the urges.  Good reviews cropped up making this game even more appetizing.  Then came the clencher.  I was at Best Buy browsing the Wii section when I saw that this game was set up to play.  I was sold after playing for about 6 minutes.  I bought it immediately, and I don't regret my decision.

This game is really fast, really fun, and very addicting.  Lots of Bots are available to race with, each with its own stats--Weight (not really sure what it does yet), Grip, Boost Length (you can hold up on the control pad to accelerate for a period of time before you overheat and have to cool off), and Boost Power (how much speed you gain from boosting).

The levels are varied, have tons of obstacles that can leave you in a wreck (a few shakes of the remote will bring you back to the game), and there are lots of weird effects you can cause.  By hitting special items you can make giant hills appear, generate items to use, or make 10 pins appear to bowl over.  Everything comes at you like crazy, and it all counts for something.

You win by earning themost stars.  How do you get stars?  A better question would be ""What doesn't earn stars?""  Drifting , staying in the air for long periods of time, performing spins in the air, driving close to trees, running into other Bots, and succeeding at the mini challenges scattered throughout the levels are all ways that you can earn stars.  And, of course, you get stars based upon what place you are in when you pass the finish line.  So, you don't necessarily have to be the first to finish to win.  But their are time limits for the levels, so you can't just go around earning stars forever to beat somebody who already finished the race.

There are tons of unlockables in this game.  You can unlock icons for your saved profile, carts, colors for your carts, trophies, and I believe dioramas (whatever those are).  To unlock everything would take quite a while, though.  I've already played for several hours, and I've only unlocked one vehicle out of at least ten (you start out with 5 I think)!

You can play split screen with two players locally, or you can play online (although I don't have the capability at the moment) with other ExicteBots owners.  There are also minigames you can play that challenge you to perform well at certain challenges, and you can play this with a friend in split screen.  There's also the Poker Race in which you form poker hands to score stars.

The point is that this game is awesome.  ExciteBots has lots of speed, diversity, unlockables, and most importantly FUN!  You owe it to yourself to buy this game.  It only costs $40 dollars, and Amazon has it for cheaper at the moment, so what are you waiting for?","Addicting, fast-paced, and just plain fun",1242950400,6,{'Edition:': ' Game only'},

There isn't much in the way of instant gratification, you earn what you get. There are tons of areas to explore and things to see. The world itself is very interesting, even going through the world alone is a treat. A change from the last Guild War is that this story carries some semblance of a single player type story. You can walk around, talk and get quest alone. So you don't have to wait around in a lobby until you have enough players to roll on a dungeon. Its not something to make or break the game, but it will appeal to a certain number of players and that is good. The leveling system is a little different.

-Fun online multiplayer (this will keep you occupied and on edge the whole time)

Mass Effect was the reason I picked up a 360 in addition to the PS3 I already own, so buying the sequel was a no brainer for me.

Despite losing some of the more traditional RPG elements of Mass Effect (like inventory management) and feeling more like an ""action"" title as opposed to an RPG, I was a bit disappointed at the two DVD set up.

While I'm happy that ME2 was apparently large enough to rrequire more than a single disc, I was less thrilled at having to change discs more than once in a playthrough (the first disc essentially contained both the beginning and the end of the game; disc 2 was the middle), even if the game was installed to the 360 HDD (a good practice for any 360 game).

Just what youy would expect in a dirt racing series. There's several types of racing from BAHA to Arena and everything in between. The AI is a too hard for my taste, even in casual mode, once you get a few races under your belt, the AI is just about unbeatable unless you crash them into rocks, trees and walls. To me, that's not racing, but I can see that the majority of buyers probably just want a crash derby in any racing game they buy (as evidenced in the online tournaments of any racing game). So if it's a crash derby, bull your way to the top, run 'em down kind of race, than Dirt 2 is the one for you. Plenty of tracks in many countries and really they did a lot of work on the tracks. They are hard to get through and the cars are loose (even with the very limited car settings).

Additional - I have to say that with most every game I have come across there are issues. Many times the issues are ones that we ""gamers"" have brought upon ourselves. Anyone with some money and enough knowhow to slap components together thinks they are computer gurus and many times they/we shoot ourselves in the foot. Gaming machines are buggy and unstable many times, due to the overclocking of components and due to the nature of ""cutting edge"" components as they usually have more issues than the components designed for slower speeds and better stability. When you see all the complaints about not being able to run a game, it's usually more of the lack of expertise of the ""gamer"" (including me), than of the game itself, but every game usually runs way better after a ""patch"", since they are seemingly always put out with problems. This game ran super smooth on my machine, but it runs much smoother at medium settings than ultra settings. That's normal with a game and truthfully I cannot see the visual difference, but the stability is so much better.

However it suffers from some of the same bad design decisions that Mass Effect 1 and Dragon Age had along with in some cases instead of fixing the problems from the previous game, just scrapping the idea all together.

One of the first things I noticed was it was much less like an RPG than the previous game.  While there is some customization with limited abilities and looks, you do not get much of a choice with any of the equipment and to make matters worse you get even LESS of a choice for your squad mates as you can not touch their armor or appearance at all.  The only saving grace here was at least you could allocate their level up points as you wish.  There is none of the standard RPG elements for how you equip your character, set up stats, expanded ability options, detailed information on equipment or even having a selection of equipment.

While the first game had an awful inventory system with way too many weapon makers, this game throws all of that away and basically gets rid of equipment all together.  Instead of getting new weapons, you get upgrades for the equipment you have.  In some cases you do get new weapons but they are very rare and cannot be traded in for cash.  Even with most of the upgrades, they are just upping damage o protection which is kind of like getting new equipment but it's not the same.

The Characters each were fantastic.  Each had a really well thought out personality and background.  Some characters I enjoyed more than others but each was just great.  Since the game centers more on them than anything else, this aspect was really important.

The story was really tight.  As things progressed it got better and better in how it really tied things from the previous games together giving the player a much deeper understanding of what is really going on in that world.  The level of detail they went into to create an entire universe rich with various cultures and histories makes Mass Effect 2 shine.

However while the story was great, the game centered around collecting a team and pretty much most of the missions in the game are all about getting your crew and keeping them happy.  It would have been really nice to break it up and have done more things leading up to preparing for the final mission instead of crew hunting.  Some characters in particular are not available until very late in the game, which really limited my time with them since you have a very limited number of possible fight encounters.

No respawning of bad guys is a recent trend from Bioware titles which lack the ability for random fight encounters and exploring.  In Mass Effect 1 & 2 along with Dragon Age, players have a set limit to how many possible fights you can ever get into and the areas you can explore are very restricted.  Once you take out the bad guys, they never come back.  This not only limits your experience but also is a huge limit on your resources like money.  That means you can never skip over any money or item and must ensure you always get the best deal when you buy something in a store.  Plus it also ensures some characters just never get much use, especially with such a limited number of player slots.

With Exploring in ME1 the Mako was horrible we all know.  Again much like the inventory system, they just totally scrap the idea and left it out instead of fixing the problems.  Exploring open worlds is a lot of fun and would give the game a more open ended feel to it and allow things to drag out much longer if we wanted.  Fallout 3 while not perfect is a great example of how much fun an open world can be with never a shortage of bad guys to fight.  With space combat the possibilities are unlimited either being in the ship or exploring a new planet.  I had really hoped to see some ship to ship fighting with the player in control making decisions on how to attack and perhaps even boarding the other ship in search of loot but we cant have everything I guess.

Speaking of Planets... scanning!  Another great idea that does not get done right... and judging from how Bioware works, instead of fixing it they will just scrap it in ME3.  The idea to pull resources out was great but all the probes and such was just a huge pain in the butt.  You had to spend tons of time just scanning over all these planets hoping to find resources.  If you even look at the planet it was then marked on your map and if you did not get the resources then, you have no way to know you did not get them out.  What they should have done is have less planets with each having a set number of resources and allowing the scanning to hunt for the major deposit only on the plant much like searching for an anomaly.  Once you find the sweet spot, you should be done with that resource on that planet.  Instead this mini game took up almost as much time as the rest of the game and at a certain point became useless as you had way more elements than needed and could not sell them or do anything with them.

Graphically the ship, the planets, characters, and just everything was just really well done and detailed.  The detail on each of the characters was stunning.  You could see the grit on many things and small details like scratches and bumps.  I was especially impressed during a few of the levels where the environment comes to life like in zero gravity settings or where there was some fog floating around.  Those kinds of details really immersed me more in the fun of the game.

The fighting was more FPS style and I believe the comparisons to Gears of War are accurate.  It's all about using cover and attacking from around it.  I was really happy to see some elevated cover settings in the game to give you more tactical options.  Combine that with being able to tell my squad members where to stand was great.  Many times I would spread my team out for a big bad guy and attack from 3 positions so they could only focus on one of us at a time.

Overall I really enjoyed the game.  I felt it was good but could have been epic if they had done a few things differently.  Hopefully they do not scrap the things people complain about this time and instead fix them along with the things they scrapped from ME1 for ME3.",Short of Epic,1266019200,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The return of the original character classes from PSO, and MAGS!

The tried and true addictive gameplay, free online play, cross-connectivity with Japanese gamers, and new, easy to use visual chat, were just bonuses.

It's almost as if Yuji Naka came back.

I like the new charge attacks, and the fact that you can switch from normal to heavy techs by holding the button down longer.  Speaking of techs, I'm glad to see real force characters make their return.  PSU ruined forces with a dependency on weapons to cast them.

Yes, my friends.  This is a true sequel to PSO.  It just feels... right.

The only thing that nags this ol' Phan is that with a game this good, you really want to play it in comfort in front of the TV.  I'd really love some kind of a cable that would allow it, or a kind of 'Echoes of time' port.  Better yet, a stand-alone Wii version.

The game is obviously created around multyplayer so don't expect much from the single player's campaign, but multyplayer is done beautifully. The game is all about strategic placements, secret reserves and knowing what your opponent is doing. Sometimes 10 minutes will pass before the 1st engagement, both players hiding their actions, carefully using terrain making sure that the advancement is not noticed.

Imagine: your tanks snuck up to the enemy lines with out being noticed, but all of a sudden an anty-tank cannons fire - 5 of your tanks lay in a pile a burning wreckage... But then you open your hand - the tanks were a decoy - the real assault are the large collection of planes quietly circling above your base... The opponent thinking he took care of your main forces and is on the move attacking the unprotected flank - your planes make a run for it - shooting across the map toward the base...

I had been waiting many years since the 2nd one to play this game and I am not disappointed at all.
This is one of the best action games i have ever played.  Rockstar has brought back max payne in the best way possible.  The story is great and makes you keep playing and compliments the action wonderfully.  Gameplay is pretty much perfected. Bullet-time is,again, the main focus in this game and it works better than ever.  Rockstar has truly outdone itself with physics and animation.  Bullets rip through bodies while leaving behind devastating damage and enemies will react realistacly depending on where they are shot.  This attention to detail also applies to max payne.  You really have to pay attention to where you use the bullet dodge in this game.  Your dodge will be cut short if you do it too close to a wall or other object.  Max will brace for impact as he is about to dive into an object leaving him vulnerable.
The AI is something to mention.  It's some of the best I have seen in a game.  Even just starting to play the game on medium difficulty I was getting worked over simply because the enemies would take advantage of every opportunity when I was focusing too long on another enemy. They flank and charge and use team work to take you down.  It makes these encounters with them all that much more intense.  Intelligently using bullet-time is a must.
This isn't the best looking game I have ever seen but it still looks really good.  Characters are animated superbly especially max payne.  The evnironments really stand out here.  Every location is chuck full of details big and small that make this game come alive.  Having a firefight in an office is thrilling when there's glass and paper flying every where and walls and pillars are breaking away while computers and tables are getting knocked over.  Rockstar definitely took advantage of the time they had with these environments to make them fun to play in.
Like I said, the story is great.  This is due to excellent voice acting in the game.  Max Payne has some of the best voice work I have ever heard.  He really helps carry the story a long with his cynical and sarcastic comments that made me laugh constantly.
This game was definitely made for max payne fans. If you loved the other games then you will most likely love this one as well.  If you didn't then it probably won't convert you.  I have heard negative comments about the game that I think are unfair.  Like this game doesn't have innovative gameplay.  I find this to be unfair simply because many games haven't had the most innovative gameplay.  Call of duty, halo sequals, mario bros. games, etc. are all great games but aren't exactly innovative when it comes to gameplay nowadays.  I think these games are
great, for example, because it takes its gameplay but sets it in creative environments that make you play it in creative ways.  This is what I think rockstar has done with max payne.  They have taken the max payne formula and have added great visuals, animation, details, story, environments, etc. to make a new experience for max payne fans.

The first Resident Evil is arguably the game that made survival horror a mainstream sort of genre in the videogame world. Alone in the Dark perhaps set the cobblestones for Resident Evil to walk on, but then Resdient Evil poured on the blacktop, baby! After Resident Evil there came Silent Hill and then a bunch of other survival horror games. Right now, it's sort of reaching its peak--that's why a few franchises (unfortunately Resident Evil being one of them) are getting out. It's kind of like the Nu Metal genre in the early 2000s. Either sink (Limp Bizkit/Silent Hill) or swim (Linkin Park/Resident Evil)--although swimming sort of sounds like selling-out to some people: I only say that as an analogy, because that is literally the best way of comparing the fall of the survival horror genre.

With that being said, it's great to go back. Resident Evil (remake--be that of the Gamecube or the Wii version) is the greatest survival horror game of all time aside from Resident Evil 4, and there's a couple reasons for that.

1. Crystal Sharp Graphics.
  - in ways it's on par with Resident Evil 4.
2. Gameplay Controls are Perfect for Suspense.
  - unlike Silent Hill's similar (but very awkward) controls, Resident Evil grants you just the right amount of control that if something starts chasing you, you won't run into walls (you may occasionally, but that would happen in real life!), and aiming is perfect. It's not action-based anyway, so it's fine that you can't specifically aim toward the head (and that's would be too easy, mind you).
3. The Camera Angles.
  - you hate them or them love, but you must understand that without the set--almost painting-like--camera setups, you won't be able to ""feel"" the atmosphere as much. And you won't have that sense of ""what's behind that corner?"" feeling.
4. Original, Compelling Story.
  - mind you, it's not about zombies in a mansion; it's about biological weoponry--and that's a realistic fear in the world.
5. The Survival Horror Elements are the Aphotheosis of all Survival Horror Games.

SURVIVAL HORROR ELEMENTS:
You have a gun with fifteen rounds (maybe less) and a knife (which you should use often). Barry's the only person with you and he's a middle aged man, so how reliable could he be when things get intense? Wesker vanished and Barry starts wandering around for clues. And depending on what character you play, you have no idea where Chris/Jill is. You're alone in a creepy mansion with creepy furniture with a creepy atmosphere with creepy music playing in the background, and oh . . . there's flesh eating dead people walking around here and there, but don't mind them, really . . . don't mind them. Because, if you kill them without destroying their brain or burning their bodies, there is a price to pay (but that's a spoiler for those who haven't played the game and are thinking about it).

You have a set amount of inventory space for healing items and weapons, then you find random items here and there, and what happens if you find something but you're inventory is full? Well, not to worry, there are storage crates in the safe rooms (along with typewriters, which are the only way to save the game, so save often!).

In other words, you have to constantly be THINKING in this game. It's not a game for those who just want action or horror; it's a puzzle game; it's a game about item management. Whenever you're in a safe room (and listening to the awesomely creepy safe room music, I must add), you gotta ask: do I want the canteen? do I have enough kerosine for it to even be worth bringing along? can I find another jug of kerosine? should I bring a shotgun (which takes up two slots) or a handgun (that takes up one)? how many healing herbs should I bring along? ammo? this random crank, will I need it? what if some zombies break in through the window? what if there are things other than zombies (which I know there are, but will they appear in the game NOW?)? this item? that item? this KEY, that KEY, dog whistle, knife? oh boy . . . it can be overwhelming. You gotta think about where you're going. If you mess up, you'll be going back to the safe room and managing your items, if, let's say, you need ""this"" key instead of ""that"" key.

And not one strategy is universally correct. For instance, when I find a key, I just run around opening all the doors that the key is used for and then throw it away so I can have an empty slot. I'm sure other players do something else. That's the brilliance of it!

Oh, and because of that one spoiler I hinted at, time is an issue when you kill a zombie. If you didn't blow it's head off, you gotta make sure you burn it before _____. Yeah. Please burn. Or else. Don't believe me, then just go around killing zombies and wasting ammo and face the consequences (and wasting ammo is a consequence within itself).

STORY:
S.T.A.R.S. are assembled to investigate a series of cannibal murders in the Raccoon City Forest. Two teams are sent, Alpha and Bravo. They see Bravo's chopper and land in the forest, investigate the scene, things happen, they run, Brad Vickers (oh Brad, how we love you), the pilot, takes off like a bat out of hell and leaves everyone to run around like chickens with their heads cut off--and they find a mansion, thank goodness gracious great balls of fire. But . . . that was just the cutscene (one of my favorite cutscenes of any game of ALL TIME).

Once inside, it's just you (Chris or Jill), Barry Burton and Albert Wesker. You hear gunfire and try to figure out who it is. Because it's obviously a Bravo team member. That is the catalyst of all the horror you will encounter in this game.

LASTING APPEAL:
I've played every Resident Evil game and this one is right underneath Resident Evil 4. Yes, I am an unbias fan. I love 4, hate 5, oh well. When I beat the game, I actually felt . . . smarter, so to speak. With difficulty comes achievement. Until they do a likeminded, graphic-improved remake of Resident Evil 2 and 3, Resident Evil is and will be the greatest survival horror game of all time because of its utilization of all the survival horror elements; for instance, creatures don't respawn, but neither does ammo--it's brilliant! At the time, the game wasn't trying to be any other game . . . it was just trying to be itself. That's why it worked (and that's why Resident Evil 5, no offense, didn't work).

THE WII ARCHIVE VERSION:
No updated graphics or gameplay--it's the same game, same features, same everything. Some people might be turned off by that, but I'm not. If you have the Gamecube version, don't buy the Wii version. But, if like me you lost your GC version or broke it or sold it and suddenly have a bizarre desire to play it again, then YOU NEED TO BUY THIS!","""WHOOOOAAAAAA!

First, when i had heard of assasins creed, i had not known anything about it. I watched a friend play the first game, and it seemed dumb in my own opinion. I also had a mobile version of AC on my old phone. Thats it.
A few months later, i researched Assasins Creed 2, and i bought it at a cheap price, thinking i wouldnt want to play it that much,oh boy- was i wrong..
Not knowing anything about AC or ubisoft, in fact, i came into the game clueless. Lets just say that the story hooked me almost immediatley.
(quick storyline: you are desmond miles- who uses the ""animus"" to go back in time to experience what happened to different assasin ancestors, in this game- Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. The story of ezio explodes within the first hour of the game, where he soon learns everything will change from his normal life)
Anyway- i was engrossed into the story and fasnciated by the way you can climb buildings. Additionally, the combat was satisfying, and there are a variety of weapons to choose from. This game has really proven me wrong and has gotten me hooked into the AC series(as i am currently playing AC Brotherhood). I should have bought this game a long time ago as almost everything is amazing about this game.
For the few things that annoy me:
-As fun as the Freerunning is, the game as serious clipping issues, where you can accidently jump off a building to your doom by pressing a button.
-the game has some diffiiculty spikes, as ive gone into rage before, but its possible to beat the game.
-when you dyschronize(fail a mission/kill innocents/leave area,ect), you are put into a trippy loading screen where it can give you a headache over time.
Thats my only compaints, but the pros conpletley outweigh the cons of this game, and has a brilliant story to be told. It is cheap enough to get for anyone, however i would wait for the AC ezio trilogy, so you can have the full AC (ezio story) experience.

Assassin's Creed II blew me away with its stunning graphics, talented voice acting, and awesome storyline. Ubisoft succeeded in making this game packed with extras and enhancing fighting techniques. When I saw Ezio use two blades on two guards for the first time my jaw dropped. When it comes to fighting, the techniques are awesome, as they were in the first game.

I do want to say that I really loved the first AC game. I have nothing bad to say about it except for the viewpoints. Needless to say I like the repetitive missions in the first game. But the missions in the second game were a bit more enjoyable. And, again, my only problem in the second game was the view points. It got so annoying to me that I eventually stopped finding them. It's time consuming every time you want to play the game again. So, with that said, I guess AC2 is an ""improvement"" but I don't really think there was anything to improve from the first game. In game trilogies, the game evolves with the series. So the developers are constantly thinking of new things and keep in mind that with the coming of time there are new techniques and environments to consider.

What I really loved was that Ubisoft didn't take too much away from the first game. They kept it on a realistic scale and there was a lot of symbolism that reverted back to AC1. I just know that sometimes a game series can get worse because they change things too much. Not in AC2. The series just got way better and I am already eager for the final installment. AC2 will HOOK you in. You don't want to stop playing it. I beat it in about 16 hours, over the course of two days. I wish I could have dragged it out a bit but I was so eager to see how it ended. And let me tell you, the ending is not what I expected, but it was good.

As for the games flaws, there weren't many. Sometimes when I would start a mission the marker wouldn't appear, and at the end of the game two of the markers didn't appear so I got confused and ended up leaving the area and then dying. When it took me back to the area the two markers had appeared that time. So yeah, some glitches when it comes to markers on missions sometimes but other than that it's flawless. A lot of people complain about trying to jump to one place but landing somewhere else. I have also experienced this, but I also experienced it in AC1 and the Prince of Persia games. The thing is, there are so many places you can jump or climb to that it's probably hard for the game to figure which one you're really directed at. I find that when I'm climbing or jumping to fast (such as in the assassin's tombs) I tend to fall. But when I take it slow and time my jumps I succeed.

5,False,"01 30, 2011",A27G9LMQTMND03,B0028A6V7Q,Patrick_91,"Magna Carta 2 starts out with a man named Juto suddenly washing up on Highwind island shore one day. Juto has lost his memory and has no idea who he is, the villagers of Highwind island take him in as one of their own and a lady named Melissa takes Juto in as family and trains him how to fight to defend the island, although for some reason holding a real sword scares the daylights out of him. Life on the island is very peaceful until something is uncovered on the island that is of great importance towards the two armies involved in a civil war, from here on out Juto's life changes drastically due to the tides of war.

That is the basic premise of Magna Carta 2, it should be noted that Magna Carta 2 has absolutely nothing to do with Magna Carta: Tears of Blood, the only thing shared here is the name. Magna Carta 2 does borrow heavily from other RPG's of the past (Last Remnant, FF7, FF8, Lost Odyssey, Blue Dragon, Infinite Undiscovery to name a few) but what is does borrow from other RPG's is the good stuff and it melds them together nicely in Magna Carta 2, the story told here is fairly good and it kept me interested all the way through. Magna Carta 2 is a fairly long game, taking me about 38 hours to complete the main story itself, if I would have done side quests (I'm not one for side quests) it probably would have tacked on an additional 5 or so hours. The one thing that kind of ticked me off was that items in Magna Carta 2 are expensive, 1 healing item in the last parts of the game is going to run you $3000! Selling old equipment is almost a waste of time as you get next to nothing for them in return, this lead me to fight monster after monster to get enough healing items to go further in the story, and trust me, your going to want extra healing items, especially early on in the game as you will go through them fast when your doing plot progressing battles, and you usually only get one chance on the field to buy healing items (usually at the start of the map, when you should be getting a chance at the middle or end of it) Overall I probably was probably grinding for money at least 6 hours total, no biggie, but healing items should not be so expensive. One thing Magna Carta 2 does well is it gives you plenty of save points and is generally fairly forgiving if you don't have enough items (it will let you run back to the end of the map to buy some more items, the enemies respawn after a certain amount time though, so you have to run back to your last save point while taking hit.

Graphics in Magna Carta 2 are for the most part, great, there are some rather murky textures on some of the NPC's and later on in the game you will get a little bit of that Last Remnant style texture loading (although not to the same extent, you will only get it on the ground textures) Gameplay is Magna Carta 2 is very fun, its done in an action style and is fast paced, you have a stamina meter and if you let it fill up all the way you will go into overdrive, here your attack power is doubled, once you fill up your overdrive gauge you will over heat, once this happens you can chain your attack with another character and do the same thing, if you can overheat your other character with a special attack before the other character recovers from overheat than both stamina gauges will be fully recharged, this is called a chain break, this adds some strategy to the game, if you fail to chain break correctly you will have 2 characters unable to act- this can prove very fatal in a boss battle. The characters in Magna Carta 2 were (to me anyway) Like able, there are no little kids in this game and the characters designs are amazing. The voice actors tend to do a good job and Juto is voiced by my favorite voice actor, Johnny Young Bosch, he generally does very convincing acting in the games he voices. You would actually be surprised to learn that, Magna Carta 2 is not a JRPG (Japanese Role Playing Game) but is a KRPG (Korean Role Playing Game) You can see that the characters are designed a wee bit different than the Japanese folks would normally do them, but I think I like the Korean art work a little better. If I did have one complaint about Magna Carta 2, it would be the ending. While it isn't bad per se it leaves too much open, the ending is not fully explained to begin with and I'm pretty sure it almost completely defies the laws of life in that games particular world. One plot point that is introduced 15 minutes (that's right 15 minutes) before the end of the game is left completely unanswered, I mean why even open up the plot like that only to not close it up at the end? To me, if they would have left that certain plot point out (it certainly did not need it) and they would have made the ending more clear, this would have been the perfect action RPG for me, on the Xbox 360.

As some final closing comments I'd like to say that a lot of people say that if you liked Infinite Undisovery than you will like Magna Carta 2. Well let me tell you, I hated, really hated Infinite Undiscovery, I didn't like the main character (sure they start out whiny and then they grow on you, but this just didn't happen in Infinite Undiscovery), and there was way to many characters (12 or so) introduced in a game not near long enough to give everyone a sufficient story, just to name a few of my complaints. But I absolutely loved Magna Carta 2, there was not a truck load of characters, and while Juto starts out whiny, he slowly started maturing, and by the end of the game, you can see what a long way he has come from the whiny little ***** he was on Highwind Island. The final thing I'd like to address is some people say you need to buy the DLC to beat the game, this is NOT true, if you are the correct level, and go in to the final boss battles prepared, the game can be beaten with out the need for the DLC (the DLC includes 2 super weapons witch pretty much brings the game down to its knees in terms of challenge) and in all truth Magna Carta 2 is not all that hard to begin with.

Overall this is one of the better RPG's on the 360 and I would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of action RPG's and some of the games I mentioned above as Magna Carta 2 does borrow story elements from them.",Absolutely Don't Die!,1296345600,12,,

It can't be helped for a game so huge that can go so many different directions. Glitches are bound to happen but I've never played a game with as many bug problems as this one has. If anything you would expect that some of the glitches would have been fixed but instead the bugs in this new title are way more severe and numerous than Fallout 3's. I'm talking game breaking and it happens a LOT. I can't tell you how many times I've had to reset my PS3 because the game froze up. I've been stuck in rocks and had companions stuck in rocks. I've been unable to walk into certain areas even though they look perfectly fine for my player to walk into. I'm talking nearly flat, open paths my grandma could walk on. Now don't get me wrong. Fallout New Vegas is a very fun game. The gameplay doesn't stray far at all from Fallout 3. The quests are fun although not as memorable as Fallout 3, and the game is enormous and will soak up a lot of your time.

  YOU WILL NEED A LOT OF PATIENCE AND KEEP MULTIPLE SAVES if you are going to have any fun playing this game though. Normally, this game would get a four star rating, possibly five from me but with all the glitches it's definitely only three and it's a bit lucky to get that in my opinion.

For the unintitated, it would be best to know what this game is not. It's not GTA with swords or a hack-and-slash game, it's purely a decision-based system in which you tell the story where to go by triggering inklings or scenes or behaving differently. Killing innocents and looting them or saving people from injustice and defending yourself with blunt attacks clearly imply 2 ways you can play the game but they don't necessarily guarantee you the same ending. No matter how you end the game, however, it begins in the same fashion. You're found on the battlefield within an inch of your life by two looters and, one way or another, you are led to a farming village where a cot is set up for you. From this point on, the fate of the town and its people is in your hands.

There are several endings, over 20 of them, which can take you anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to complete. Beating the game or leaving the town altogether, reseting the game, will result in the end of that play session and the final summation of ""samurai points"" you have attained. for every act of villainy such as kicking an unarmed villager or slashing/killing people who don't deserve it or are unarmed will decrease your total by 50 while progressing into a story branch and/or obtaining titles through play such as Rich Samurai for having 10,000 mon on you will raise that base total which adds or subtracts from your points bank - rewarding you with new faces/outfits/accessories/safes to hold weapons/difficulties/etc. Wanna look like Gackt in a tuxedo weilding a blacksmith hammer? Go for it.

Now to play devil's advocate: It's fun, definitely, and I'm still playing it. Over 30 hours in so far, personally, but the replay value is different for all people. For the Gears/God of War crowd, this may be too much of a chore with how slow-paced it can be or its lackluster graphics (yes, it's not Killzone 4 but no one's playing this for its looks). If you like the idea of a game being significantly different depending on whether or not you bowed to that woman or spoke negatively about that clan, you're in for a treat because while it doesn't have the same dialogue branching detail as a Bioware title, the story itself goes in another direction. That said, the con side to this is that you don't know exactly what choice will equal a desired result, which either results in trial and error or having to be faithful to a guide written by gamers. Yeah, forget about a strategy guide or in-depth explanation within the game itself, any and all support for all the titles in this series has and will come from the fans.

If you're willing to engross yourself in its world or are playing along with a guide, that's your best bet for knowing all you need to know about WotS3 and you'll still either love or hate this game. But if you're interested thus far, you may end up becoming a fan once you get used to its inner workings and controls. By no means is this a AAA title but it has so many complex nuances that makes it at the very least worth a hard look.

you can choose from different classes, customise attributes like in old school Bard's Tale game, and play 3d hack and slash style RPG. So, what is so bad about it?

While Blur utilizes a power-up system with similar elements such as forward and rear firing weapons, shields and speed boosts, this is a different game.

Blur is a game that uses models of actual cars from Ford, Chevrolet, Audi and others in an environment that attempts to appear quasi-realistic. While the visuals may be based on real world environments, the gameplay is closer to an arcade-style racer with social elements included. While there are differences in controlling the various vehicles it is not a realistic driving simulator. Some vehicles may have better turning or acceleration but the differences aren't as great as the cars in Grand Theft Auto games.

I find the gameplay mechanics to be adequate. There is nothing inherently wrong with them as far as arcade racers go but they aren't revolutionary. Even the vehicular combat feels like we have done this before but the game is well done. I do have to admit that when racers wreck they do so spectacularly.

Blur's biggest draw is the social aspect. There is an online multiplayer mode with up to 20 players which makes for some frantic races. You can accept challenges from your friends or even make your own challenges and send them out. This is very cool but this is not hyped very much. For example, I might score an excellent time on a particular course and send a challenge to my friends and they will receive a message in their system messages inbox. You can also create and receive individual challenges and this adds a new element of fun that is not present in other racers.

You can also post your accomplishments on FaceBook or Twitter from within the game. I find this feature to be a bit useless but those who enjoy bragging about their trophies or achievements may enjoy this.

All in all, I find Blur to be an enjoyable racing game that most people won't know about because it lies under the shadow of Gran Turismo 5. If you can find Blur for $20 or less, it is a solid pick-up.

Final note: I have the PS3 port of Blur and I actually had to change my network settings to connect to the game servers. None of my other games require me to do this. After some research I see that this is a common problem. It isn't that hard to get your game connected but if you are buying this for your children you might want to adjust your network before letting them play.

A number of graphical improvements have also been made, along with other improvements to gameplay. Despite initial misgivings on my part, the addition of motion controls to the first two games actually enhanced the gameplay by making aiming more fluid while still keeping the core mechanics intact. Also new are more and varied difficulty levels to choose from, along with a host of unlockable bonus items such as econcept art and dioramas. I am still puzzled as to why Nintendo chose to retain the pointless and annoying Friend Voucher system from Metroid Prime 3 to unlock some of these, however, as it lends nothing to the experience aside from keeping many extras out of reach.

As a more hardcore Metroid fan, my only gripe is that most of the enjoyable exploits and sequence breaks from the first two games have also been removed, which is a shame since most of these enhanced and extended replayability. This increases linearity and consequently detracts from the game long term, so if you have an GC-compatible Wii or a Gamecube the original North American releases are the way to go to get the most from each game.

The story however never really grabbed me...I never got to know my character and at no point did I ever feel like I was properly introduced into the story. What I mean is that I felt lost as to who or why I was playing. I felt as if my background was missing, and to me that's a huge part of story. During almost the entire campaign, I had no idea what I was there to do. So I just completed objectives and kept going. To me the campaign was forgettable, something developers do not want to hear.

Gameplay:
I think what I liked best about the gameplay was the ability to add attachments on the fly as long as I had previously discovered them. This makes a lot of sense to me.  I also liked the amount of weaponry in the game...there are a lot of guns (at at least it felt that way) and it was fun playing with each to just wreak havoc on the enemies.  As far as the suit, it is a great tool to have. However, because I am given the option to stealth out, I feel as if I need to...just because I can. And I think this took away some of the chaos that is inherent to 1st person shooters. I like to be put into a position where I am drastically outnumbered and I must rely on good tactics to get out of it. There were only two times that I could think of in this game where that happened to me...and twice is not enough. It just makes things too easy, regardless of how cool it is. Maybe I should go back and try playing without stealth and just use the armor, but I don't know...there's nothing really there to make me want to do it all again. And lastly, maybe I'm used to CoD  and MoH type campaigns as of late where 6 hours and you were done, but this campaign lasted well beyond that. I don't know how much time I put in, but I can't help but feel that it dragged on in the end. I literally at some points was asking myself ""when is this going to end?"". If the story was better I probably wouldn't have felt like that.

Multiplayer:
I'm only level 6 atm, so I haven't spend much time playing. I did play a few rounds last night and I wasn't doing all that well and was about to quit. Then I realized that I had earned an equipment unlock, so I purchased a red dot sight and figured I'd try one more round.  Bam!  16 / 3. It was a great round and I earned multiple dog-tags. Because of that I will be coming back for more tonight. This situation is no different than any other other 1st person multiplayer...good rounds keep you coming back. So I do think they did a good job on the multiplayer aspect, but I still need to spend more time with it to be sure. Also, it's fun learning new maps...they really do look good.",Crysis 2...not what I had expected.,1305590400,15,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Good: The campaign on Crysis 2 is nice, graphics like details and lighting are pretty darn good. Runs very smooth, weapons have a feel between Call of duty and Halo. The nano suit is what makes this game cool because you have to use it smartly. You can turn that baby to full protection but if you run or shoot it starts to get weaker.
The Multiplayer is one fun part of Crysis 2. It plays like a fast paced Halo but with more perks. You get to upgrade your suit, unlock and upgrade your weapons. I was getting owned the first few times I played online, but once you start to upgrade and ranking up the game play is more leveled.

The Bad: There are some glitches on the campaign that are not bad enough to put this game down, but are there nonetheless. I have seen the AI hide behind a wall and while I am shooting at it its like they fly up in the air for a second then come down. LOL Its hard to explain it but I will post a video. Also, for some reason I experienced sound breaking on a few scenes at the beginning. It could be my set up, who knows, but I haven't experienced that in any of my other games. Nothing bad to say about the multiplayer because as of this writing I have not seen or had any glitches, nor connection issues. That part of the game is Gold.

5,False,"11 20, 2011",A27OW0P38B28OP,B002BSC54I,Relytia,"The Legend of Zelda series is one of the greatest video game franchises of all time, and arguably, it's *thee* greatest. With each release, Nintendo has showed us the magic of journeying through Hyrule's beautiful kingdom. Now, they have done it again, greatly injecting innovation into the tried-and-true formula of past titles. This is a Zelda game unlike any other, and feels all at once both an incredible nostalgic celebration of 25 years of history, and a wholly new adventure full of wild, awesome new directions. Get ready for a fairly long review, but please know that this is written from the heart of a young man who loves the series above most others in his favorite pastime.

The story and characters present in Skyward Sword are very different among the other Zelda titles, despite the obvious recurring ones. I don't just mean the amazing setting of Link's home, Skyloft, a fantastical city floating above the clouds where everone is bonded to their own guardian birdlike creature, a loftwing. No, from the start, Nintendo truly changes almost everything of what you'd come to expect from a Zelda game. This is the earliest tale in the series chronologically, acting as a prequel, making way for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocarina-of-Time-s/dp/B003O6E800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocarina of Time's</a>&nbsp;tale to come. Zelda is not a princess here, just another common schoolgirl. She and Link have been best friends since childhood, and may even have feelings for each other (it's pretty obvious, and incredibly touching. My wife and I were both pretty moved by it). In Skyloft, the local school is essentially a knights academy, the uniform being a tunic that is easily recognizable to fans of the series. After completing a ceremony to become a senior in his class (the senior tunic is, you guessed it, dark green), Zelda and Link ride together through the sky to celebrate. Out of nowhere, a malevolent tornado knocks Zelda to ""the surface,"" a vast, unexplored land below the cloud cover and once again, Link takes up the mantle of being a fated hero, destined to save the day. I'll stop here, because this is virtually spoiler free and if I say more it won't be. Just know that Nintendo has really changed up the formula of story and characters we've come to expect from the Zelda franchise, and as a result, Skyward Sword feels incredibly refreshing.

Another immediately noticeable change is in presentation. The story is much, much more cinematic than Zelda has ever been. Cinematic shot angles are much more dynamic than ever before, character expression is stunning, animation is smooth and realistic, and the writing is just fantastic. If anything, this feels like a very intimate entry in the Zelda series, not just epic or grand like past titles. It's a lovely direction for the Zelda series, if you ask me. The characters all come to life thanks to this presentation, of course, but the writing present certainly helps too. Each character has so much personality, and talking to each of them is a joy. Link is a somewhat distracted dreamer with his head in the clouds, loves to sleep, but has tons of courage and kindness, a true hero. Accompanying him in his journey is Fi, a new kind of companion to the series. Fi looks like a ceramic doll, her ""speech"" sounds like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GLaDOS/dp/B003O6E3C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GLaDOS</a>, and is purely logic driven. She is amazing. Zelda is a strong-willed, tough tomboy of sorts, and very lovable. Lord Ghirahim, the new villain, is *extremely* compelling and creepy (Ganandorf makes no direct appearance). All of these characters, as well as the plethora of side characters, are written and presented beautifully.

The art design and graphical implementation is awesome here. The game has married the art design of two past masterpiece Zelda title styles into one wholly unique direction. You have more realistic people and settings, like in the dark, mature&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Princess/dp/B0009UBR3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Princess</a>, but you also have the vibrant color and imagination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-Waker/dp/B000084318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind Waker</a>, and it is a joy to behold. Nintendo EAD designed the game to look like a water color painting, and I must say, they did a fantastic job doing so. Draw distances are fairly short, and anything beyond is purposely blurred to look exactly like a water-color painting of the impressionist style, full of  brushstrokes of beautiful color. I am deeply impressed here. The Wii is a painfully underpowered system in comparison to its two competitors, but it is genius art design like this that shows why the Wii has had some of the most beautiful titles of this generation (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metroid-Prime-3/dp/B000FQBPDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metroid Prime 3</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Muramasa-The-Demon-Blade/dp/B001HB7K6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Muramasa: The Demon Blade</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Galaxy/dp/B000FQ9QVI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Galaxy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Mario-Galaxy-2/dp/B002BSA388/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Okami/dp/B000Z9A95M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Okami</a>, now this game, the list goes on and on). To put it succinctly, Skyward Sword is one of the most beautiful games in recent memory, and that is totally thanks to the absolutely brilliant (and well implemented) art design.

Koji Kondo and Hajime Wakai; any fan of Nintendo will instantly recognize these names as two of the greatest musical composers of video gaming. They are almost unrivaled as composers, writing some of the most iconic music in the entire medium. Koji worked as musical supervisor in this title (as well as composed the main theme and some other songs). Hajime was in charge of music composition. This may be, and I *do not* say this lightly, some of their very best work yet. The music here ranges from the entire spectrum of musical emotion: epic, intimate, touching, sad, meditative, dark, joyous, achingly beautiful, uplifting, goofy/doofy (for a certain character), anything you can imagine. Each theme, whether for an event, a character, a place, whatever, is absolutely perfect for its place and can greatly change depending on the situation. It takes something special for music to not only define the experience for any gamer playing the game, but also convey the emotion and thought its supposed to, and the soundtrack here does so perfectly. Like most Zelda games, Link acquires a musical instrument that helps progress the story (Ocarina of time had... well... duh. Wind Waker had a baton), here it is a harp. You can play it at any time, and when you do, you can actually accompany the beautiful background music of wherever you happen to be on the harp. That's very, very cool. Great job Koji and Hajime! You're amazing.

The gameplay is what you're probably the most curious about. Does the Wii-Motion Plus work? Yes, it does very well, for the most part. You'll have to deal with calibration from time to time, sometimes actions won't register the way you hoped, but it's not too big a deal and doesn't happen nearly enough to mar the experience. The 1:1 swordplay works pretty flawlessly once you become acquainted with it. Link will seamlessly swing his sword however you do. Horizontal, vertical, diagonal, it all works quite well. Pretty much every enemy you will encounter will require a different strategy to defeat, and I have found that the swordplay grows more enthralling with each hour I play (Boss fights are outstanding). It took me quite a while to get used to it, but I must say that this is truly the game the Wii was made nearly six years ago for. It's about time. The quest items you'll find are also a blast to use. They give you some new ones right off the bat, and they're all awesome, feeling completely new yet appropriate for the franchise. Also, Link now has stamina that runs out as he climbs and dashes throughout the world (yes, Link can now sprint around if you'd like). Link's stamina actually adds a small layer of strategic depth to the game, and the concept comes into play in many scenarios throughout the game. This gameplay concept worried me at first, but it's actually really enjoyable, and implemented excellently.

So far, I have been through three temples in about 20 hours (I bought my copy at a midnight release ""party"" and have been playing ever since). Gone is the field-dungeon-field formula of past titles. Instead, here you have a hub world, the realm above the clouds, with Skyloft as your main town to visit. Here you can restock supplies, buy or upgrade your shield and other equipment using items you've scavenged in your questing rpg-style, and go on very personal side quests that feel very much like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Majora-s-Mask/dp/B00004U1R1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Majora's Mask</a>&nbsp;did, making for a character-driven experience. A great change of formula, one I was *very* skeptical about beforehand.

You can ride your loftwing and drop to the surface world below at key rifts in the clouds. Here, you have more concentrated lands you can adventure through until you get to a dungeon/temple that will advance the story. The world below, and its temples, feel quite a lot like the Metroid series. The land is more condensed and concentrated, feeling like dungeon of sorts by themselves, but as you acquire newer items, more and more dimensions will open up in those places as you revisit them. It's a huge change-up to the Zelda formula, but one that feels surprisingly good. As I've said, I've played through three temples so far and I am amazed at the ingenuity of them. Yes, you'll be pushing blocks and shooting targets to open doors, but you'll also encounter brilliant new puzzles. I mean, the puzzles are challenging and downright laugh-inducing in their ingenuity, and feel very satisfying when you figure them out. Combine this with the totally awesome new items, stellar swordplay, and ease of use and you get the feeling that every area feels like an innovation, in much the same way playing through Super Mario Galaxy 2 felt like standing before a firing squad of brilliant new ideas. I am downright astonished. I did not think it could be done, honestly, but this game really has reinvigorated the series through great change to the formula rather than refining it further like Twilight Princess did, and trust me when I say no one is more surprised than me.

This is a brilliant game, even among the other entries in what has been for 25 years a brilliant series. It takes Zelda in a plethora of new directions, while miraculously feeling *exactly* like a true-to-form Zelda game. Color me surprised. If you're a fan of Zelda, then you don't need me to tell you to go get this right now. This series has some of the most diehard fans of any gaming franchise out there, but just for emphasis' sake, I proudly, and loudly proclaim that this game is incredible! Buy it, soar through the realms above, and dive to the vast, mysterious lands below and fulfill your destiny to save the world once again!

* I know this review is quite long, but honestly, this game has so much that merits attention, the review could be much, much longer and still be appropriate. I will edit my review as I play through the game more if I feel there is something worth mentioning that I come across. However, I feel that this is a pretty good summary that hopefully gives you a good picture of the game. Seriously, go get it, like, right now. You won't regret it.

Final Update, 11/27/11:

Ok, after playing the game for roughly 50 hours I have finally beaten Skyward Sword. In short, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Each and every hour spent in this game was filled to the brim with brilliance and excellence, and not one single minute felt wasted. This feels like the Super Mario Galaxy 2 of Zelda titles, where there seems to be an exciting new gameplay/puzzle element at every turn. The story is incredible, with a lot of twists that genuinely thrilled and surprised me. This game essentially acts as an origin story for the entire Zelda series. Pretty much every element that you're familiar with from Zelda games see their true origin here, and it is spectacular (I won't give any spoilers though, you'll be blown away when you experience it for yourself). I have to say that I have not been this entranced and enthralled by a Zelda game since Ocarina of Time or The Wind Waker, and I am a HUGE fan of pretty much every entry in the entire Zelda series, so I don't say that lightly. The music is among the series' very best, which by itself is a massive accomplishment. The visuals the art design are incredibly beautiful, some of the most gorgeous and brilliantly inspired of the past decade, despite the underpowered system it is on. Because of all of this, I was compelled to play this constantly until beating it, AND there's a new game plus mode that adds substantially to the game as well! For fans of the series, this game is an immediate must-own. I give it the highest recommendation possible. I absolutely love this game, and I'm fairly certain most of you out there will too.

*That's my final statement. This is meant to finalize the points I made from my original review, which I think will be as detailed and informative as anyone would want or need.

The Bad: Low enemy variety, upgrading suit powers is a little underwhelming, story isn't very good and is confusing, you need a monster/top of line rig to get the best visual experience

Being a regular human in a shooter has been done hundreds of times, but being a true one man army with technology built into your nano-suit is something that hasn't really been done before. Meet Alcatraz. The poor dying soldier/nobody who Prophet chose to stick his suit on and kill himself. Now you are thrown into the war that you wanted nothing to do with and are the key to helping stop the invasion on Manhattan.

A lot that you remember from the first game is different now thanks to the game being streamlined for consoles. You no longer have a power wheel and two of them have been taken away and put into the other two. You get to switch between armor mode and stealth mode. You can use your super power moves in armor mode such as powerful kicks and punches as well as absorbing long falls. Stealth mode allows you to cloak and sneak up on enemies or just go right on past without being detected. Both of these are key to staying alive and you will be switching constantly.

Another thing that has changed was that lush jungle you got to roam around in freely. You are now stuck in a concrete world and the game is more linear this time around. That's not all bad because you still get to choose your approach to firefights and some areas are massive. Using your tactical visor the game will give you options to approach the battle such as certain weapons, high perches for sniping, or complete paths to totally avoid all enemies. This still gives you the sense of battle control like in the first game without making it feel like a Halo/Call of Duty hallway clone.

You have two enemies in the game: Ceph aliens and the CELL army trying to capture and use your technology for their own good. The story isn't exactly the most cohesive thing we've seen as wasn't the first game either. The story is kind of confusing and you never really know what's going on between all the characters, and it doesn't get really good until the last couple of missions. The middle of the game is a lot of back and forth between Hargreave and Gould who are two scientists with completely different views. The CELL enemies are just like regular humans, but later on the game throws countless Ceph at you and they have different types of Ceph that come after you from grunts to huge walking tanks. Of course this makes the game feel very repetitious due to the low enemy type and the game doesn't really look different from area to area except different levels of destruction.

There is a little more to it than just shooting everything in sight. You can upgrade your powers this time around by collecting nano catalysts from dead Ceph, and the stronger the Ceph the more you will get. Press the upgrade button and Alcatraz's hand will be displayed with five different areas of upgrades on his fingers. A few examples are bullet tracers, longer stealth mode, and the ability to see cloaked enemies. While it does change the game play a bit it doesn't do a lot to truly enhance the experience. Not to mention the fact that you have to watch your energy meter when using power because it runs out in a matter of seconds. Using your night vision plus stealth while running will run it down in less than 10 seconds so you never truly feel powerful or get the ability to upgrade your energy meter.

Of course you can still customize your weapons with different sights, silencers, and other attachments, but I wish we could use every attachment for every gun instead of each gun getting its special options. There are some new guns however and there are plenty, but they are fun to shoot so don't think that the weapon selection is weak  at all. There are some other things thrown in like a few turret sections, and some quick time events thrown into the cinematic parts of the game which are thrilling and very fun, but they are too short and to far apart from each other. The linearity of the game allows this type of cinematic control and its welcomed, but I would have liked to see more of it.

Your probably wondering about the graphics. Since this is streamlined for consoles do we get DirectX 11? Do we get higher resolution textures and extra graphic options? When the game launched it was no. We got exactly what the consoles got, but a few months later the DirectX 11 patch was released as well as a high-resolution texture pack. With this the game looks phenomenal and probably the best looking shooter to date. Of course you need a monster rig to the run the game with these settings enabled. Even my rig dropped in the single digits during certain scenes, but man is it gorgeous to look at. The game also supports 3D so if you have the GPU then enable it because it does enhance the experience a lot.

Overall there are a few bugs that can some times hinder the game, and it also is very long for an FPS running about 10-12 hours. The multiplayer is also very addictive and fun for a while with perks upgrades and there is a good variety of maps available. I had a lot of fun since using the suit powers kind of makes playing an FPS different online. However, it still doesn't have that addictive quality of Call of Duty or Halo to keep you playing for months or years after release. So, with an underwhelming story, and low enemy variety just stomach the repetition for a while and you'll be treated to one gorgeous and fun shooter.","Not as good as the first, but is really fun",1332892800,3,{'Format:': ' Software Download'},

I couldn't care less about that part of the game. I'm not a car expert so I only do limited tuning, although I may try a bit harder after getting through the single player season mode.

The season mode offers up races based on your prior race preferences and cars in your garage. It makes it so you don't need to try to find races you qualify for. I'm a decent racer, but not great for sure and have found the season mode a bit easy after 3 seasons. I have most of the assists turned off and the AI on medium. My guess is that cranking up the AI skill would provide a challenge to more skilled players. One thing I don't like about the events is that it doesn't give you a track map before hand so you can't easily see how you might want to tweak your car. The cars feel different and believable when driving them. I visuals are excellent and make the racing more enjoyable.

I focus on single player only as there are too many brats online, but people have been complaining on the forums that the match making for races isn't as good as Forza 2.

Many of the reviews here are correct and precise about the flaws, some bugs and 'dumbing down' of this game... so I'll only agree with them and not go into detail here.  However, I will say I pre-ordered this game and paid a hefty price - so I expected to be reasonably pleased for the money. Am I?  Wellll... to be honest, I am enjoying it.  The lack of instant saves can be VERY annoying, but I usually try a different tactic on 3rd or 4th try (and up - I guess I'm just not very good even on 'Soldier' level ;-)  - and don't really mind that much because I'm stretching my 'enjoyment' factor as far as my $60 bucks will take me. Graphics are just fine (Win7/64/8gigs quad/ATI Radion 4600).  And game-play is also smooth enough.  HERE'S MY BIGGEST COMMENT/COMPLAINT: WHERE IS THE COMPELLING ORIGINALITY?!  I'm still looking for a 'new' game that ""wows"" me like HalfLife(2), Far Cry (with I loved - and played thru at least 4 times!!!) - and even NOLF (No One Lives Forever 2 for those uninitiated - which I also loved! The music was great!)  Staying in the city with Crysis 2 becomes somewhat boring after a while (yes... similar to F.E.A.R. as others have noted). I can't recommend this for the current price... I'd suggest you wait a while. It is, again, fun.  My lack of enthusiasm should give you a hint.

Question: WHY pre-order and pay near $60 when a week later the 'instant order' price is only $52 (and receding)?  Consider this the end of my pre-ordering anything on Amazon.","Fun enough, I guess.  So, what else can you show me?",1301270400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Gamers that complain about not being able to dodge while aiming missiles need to step up their game because I was always able to dodge in the middle of aiming.

Is this game sexist? No. In fact, it is the opposite. Samus is the only female warrior in the game. However, that makes her ascension to the top of the ranks all that more impressive. Her commanding officer, Adam Malkovich, decides when she can activate her suit's latent abilities. People have a huge problem with this, and can't get over it. Think of it this way. Although Samus Aran is an independent bounty hunter, for this mission on the Bottle Ship, she allows herself to obey Adam Malkovich as if she was one of his soldiers. Also, the game gives an example of why certain abilities should not be used indiscriminately. Early on, Adam prohibits the use of the Power Bomb because it might have dire implications for the structural stability of the ship. Use that example and apply it to all Samus's other abilities. Also, the way that your abilities are unlocked are kind of epic. For example, you will be struggling against a boss, and then BAM, Adam authorizes a new ability and you mop the floor with it. Also, remind yourself that if this operation is to go as smoothly as possible, she will have to obey his orders to an extent, just like all his other soldiers. You are not alone. Also, from a gameplay standpoint, this is always how Metroid games have functioned: start off as a weakling, and slowly gain new powers, and by the end of the game, you're a bad-ass. This power-acquisition protocol actually makes much more logical sense than finding powers inside monsters or in hidden, out-of-the-way locations. Also, at the end of the game, you learn more about Samus's mental and emotional reasons for following Adam's orders.

This game and Samus Aran are both highly misunderstood. In the Western world, strength is colloquially assigned masculine attributes: rudeness, boldness, loudness, physical heftiness, etc. Samus Aran possesses a quiet, inner strength that the less perceptive people will not be able to catch. If you look at Mass Effect and choose to create a female Shepard, she behaves in the exact same way that the male Shepard does. So what does that say about sexism? Bioware is implying that a ""strong"" female protagonist must behave like a male protagonist to be strong. Now that is sexist. Mass Effect is more sexist than Metroid: Other M. By showing a different way to be strong: inner strength, bravery, non-flashiness, a lot of people mistook that for weakness. It flew right over their heads. No. Samus Aran is a strong individual in Metroid: Other M. She doesn't need to act like a jackass (like Jack from Mass Effect 2) to be strong. We need to shed the stereotypes of strength and look beyond the exterior and feel the interior: the heart, the soul. You can even hear Samus talking to herself during the game. How can you not see that she is a strong character?

The game itself is very good; it feels like a Metroid game. I thought that auto-aim might make the game too easy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case. In fact, this is the second-most difficult Metroid game in the series, next to the first Metroid, which honestly is not saying much because Metroid games have traditionally been concerned less with difficulty and more with level design and exploration. This difficulty comes in three parts: boss battles, Search View, and basic adventuring.

Some of the boss battles in this game are fantastic. They will make you think, and have you dying over and over again while you figure out the right strategy for beating them. Oddly enough, I found this to be fun. When something is difficult but in the realm of perceptibly surmountable, it is good.

There are parts of the game that put you into a mandatory first-person view mode, called Search View. You can also activate this mode manually. But in the mandatory Search Views, you must search the environs and lock onto the correct thing in order to proceed through the game. It is ridiculous how hard it is to figure out some of the tiny, obscure things you have to look at to advance the game. This is the only bad thing about the game, and why it didn't get five stars from me.

What I meant by ""basic adventuring"" was basically ""figuring out what to do next"" - a staple of action/adventure games. On first glance, I did not think this game would be very difficult to figure out what to do next, and be as creative and extensive as the Prime games, but it is. This game is very dark (as in brightness), so early on, I was baffled at times, looking at the dark environments trying to figure out what to lock onto and do next. Later on, I would get stuck, only to find I had to go into first-person mode at a weird location, but I did not think all this ambiguity detracted from the game. The only part that I did think detracted from the game was when I had to backtrack to get an item to advance, when it was not obvious I had to. This only happened once, so it is more or less forgiven. Overall, I was impressed with how ""organic"" the ""puzzles"" felt. I figured out that there was a morph-ball hole from Zoomers crawling out of the wall. Metroid Prime 2 had all these weird morph-ball puzzles (that were cool, don't get me wrong), but seemed out-of-place. Metroid: Other M keeps everything believable.

Another thing that helps keep everything believable is the awesome soundtrack. Metroid: Other M is as moody and creepy as ever. Other than the menu theme, I didn't like Metroid Prime's music. Some of the tracks were too whimsical for a Metroid game. Metroid: Other M doesn't suffer from this whimsy at all. Subtle and effective would be two words to describe its tracks. Also, there are some remixed songs that play at just the right moment that pump you up. It's awesome.

The controls are great. Although you auto-aim, you must be facing the enemy within 90 degrees on either side of it or you won't target it. This basically means that you can't be facing away from an enemy, press the ""1"" button, and expect to hit it. This is great because it balances the ease afforded by the auto-aiming.

In Metroid Prime, you could lock onto a target, hold either left or right, and tap B to dodge. In Other M, you can dodge attacks by tapping the d-pad (this move is called SenseMove). It works well, and its animation is very stylish. This has been balanced by making enemies attack more frequently at times. Thus, for instance, you will be mashing that d-pad during a fierce attack barrage, and when the barrage concludes, you will be able to attack.

Search View has been unfairly criticized. Sure, you can not move, but you can shoot incoming projectiles, preventing them from hitting you, and also SenseMove out of it. It is not too cumbersome to go from NES-style Wiimote mode to Search View. If you need to shoot a missile, there is always an adequate window of time in which you can do so, where the boss or enemy is not attacking you.

The graphics are fantastic for a Wii game. Sometimes, when a pre-rendered cutscene ended and gameplay started, I could not tell the difference. Also, the game is very stylish, like Metroid: Zero Mission was. You will be proud to guide the sleek and sexy Samus Aran to victory.

The story, if you can understand that it is not sexist, as explained above, is very good. The story sequences, told with both pre-rendered movies and in-game graphics, work very well in that they explain the past, the current situation and motivate you to keep playing the game and find out more.

This game is very similar to Metroid Fusion in that respect. Some of the save-points here operate like the Navigation Rooms of that game, and both tell and show you where you need to go next. This is fine because it points you in a general direction, but not the necessary steps to get there. Even with this help-system, I got stuck numerous times; don't worry, it won't baby you or annoy you.

Overall, this feels like a Metroid game. This game could have been called Metroid Fusion because it fuses the 2D games with the 3D games and makes an excellent hybrid. If I could improve this game, I would make the mandatory SenseViews more intuitive, have an analog stick controlling Samus (Wiimote + nunchuk), and make it so that I am able to move in Search View.

4,False,"12 3, 2010",A3PI416G5W6FK2,B002BSA1C6,Bonnie Ciafre,"I really like the Gran Turismo series. This one is no different, but the game has a lot of problems and faults.
 The first issue is that there are far to many cars from Asia and to little from Europe or America. You may say this isn't an issue, but think of this. There is an 88 Accord and no 80s-90s fox Mustang.(The most popular car at an American track) Thats pretty bad, but Diatsue has more cars than Dodge or Jaguar. There are little Pontiacs and NO Porsches.(They give us Ruf instead) The Ferraris are lacking in any classic cars. But we have thirty different Lancers, and to many Civics to care about. I understand they are from Japan, but really. This is a racing game.
 Then there is a very Japan type feel and the menu is confusing at first. Thats not what grinds my gears. The fact that there are Standard cars and Premium cars sucks. The standards are in the used car market. You have to wait for the car you want to come around, but this time they never change color. Both Camaros in this department are mystic teal, and the XJ220 comes in silver. If you don't or do buy it, the next time you see one of them. They will be the same color. Ofcoarse you can change the color, but only if you own a car with that color. You buy a car and you can match its color. That is so dumb. You can't change standard cars rims. The Premiums are annoying too. The whole time you will think why are some of these a ""P"" car? And how didn't the Supra make that cut? Thats my biggest beef.
 The next problem is with the flickering shadows under and around all cars, damage or lack there of. These things are what Forza does better. Forza has better cars, better menu, interiors of all cars, major customization, but Gran Turismo has better physics, NASCAR,carts, weather!, and most important Rallies. I think its frustrating because GT5 could have been better. The Rally peice is really good though and makes me forget the faults, until I get to the menu again. They also got rid of drag racing for some reason.(WHY?)They got rid of some of the best tracks, and even the Test Track. I don't undertand why, but tuning isn't as important as it use to be. If you get a fully custom trans you'll see what I mean. Its like gearing for dumbies.
 Still with these complaints I think it is the best driving game out there, even with Forza having better cars. I just think they really could have done better.","1000 cars,like 300 duplicates",1291334400,5,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Graphics:
They are pretty well done, everything fits the personality of the game.  It include well detailed maps and characters that give alot of personality to the game and gives me the idea that the developers who made Modnation Racers that they care about the consumers and will not hold back on what they are capable of.  The racing tracks are pretty nicely detailed, and so how are the carts and characters.  (Well, the main storyline characters.)

Gameplay:
I know I will sound like a fanboy like this, but the gameplay on Modnation Racer is ALOT more enjoyable than what Mario Kart had to offer.  I feel more in control of the game and the controls feels alot better.  I like how the drift button is placed.  Makes sense.

Customization:
Thia is what they have done PERFECTLY.  It's like Little Big Planet, but on a racing scale.  Custom cart, character, track, and designs.  This makes the experience of the game last ALOT, and on the PLUS side you can get XP for having people who use your design...and being able to BANK off of it.  That's truly rewarding.

Con:
Probably just the load times I had with the game, and sometimes when I get knocked off track it takes awhile for the game to pull me back into the racetrack.  Just minor flaws that will probably be fixed with an update.","Really GOOD GAME, however the load times.",1274832000,2,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

I'll start this off by saying that I wanted so badly to give this five stars - but I can't do so. I wanted for this game with a lot of anticipation - in fact, it's the only reason I still own my Wii. I got the bundle yesterday and got an extra copy for my older brother (he's 36 - I'm 25!) as a Christmas present. He's the reason I got into Zelda in the first place.

The story in this game is very deep. It definitely feels like a Zelda game and it has me on the edge of my seat seeing how Link's epic journey through time began. The graphics are wonderful in my opinion - it reminds me of a water color painting. My girlfriend noted that they looked ""washed out"" but on my 46"" LED HDTV - I think they look stunning and vibrant - full of life and warmth. The sound is also wonderful - orchestrated Zelda music? Yes!

Now, the controls on the other hand.. they're a mixed blessing, and the reason for the four star review. I found myself swiping in the proper direction in order to get by enemy defenses - only to be met with a ""clack"" and my blow rejected. The ""one-for-one"" sword play in this game, in my opinion, isn't one-for-one. Perhaps I just need more time to get used to the game - but as of now, it's very frustrating. Flying Link's bird is also very frustrating, especially during a retrieve scenario at the beginning of the game. I found myself flopping around the air like a chicken with its head cut off - and I've owned my Wii since release - never had issues like this before. The sequence directly after - jumping off a cliff and letting out Link's sail for a soft landing (Pilotwings style!) was equally frustrating. The game only said to ""tilt"" the remote - it didn't say up or down, side to side - I had to redo the sequence numerous times before I ""got"" it.

But regardless, I love the game. Maybe I'm becoming an old gamer.. but I'd prefer a more traditional control scheme.",I wanted to bad to give this five stars..,1321833600,13,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4,False,"09 4, 2010",A1TY4TRLA4QK5Y,B002BSC4ZS,Brian,"Other M is a major deviation from the recent Wii Metroid run in virtually every stripe. For all of those who busted their behinds to get a shot of Samus without her helmet, you'll finally get your wish, as this includes cinematics and screens without even the trademark armor. Full dialogue and interactive NPC's mean that there's an actual plot line apart from collect the same set of equipment. And while side of the internal monologues are a bit cheesy, they still manage to add appeal and depth to a character that's thus far been a virtual mute.

Other M starts with a retconn immediately following Metroid Prime. Strangely lamenting the death of the baby Metroid, Samus answers a distress call from a Federation ship where she runs into several of her old squadmates, including her old CO.

Controls have radically changed. You're back to a 2-d on 3-d platformer, with movement and combat on one hand and stand alone aiming on the other. This present an annoying challenge at times, as you can no longer move while trying to fire precision shots or missiles, though this is easily balanced by useful auto-aiming during your platformer views. The camera gets poorly placed a few times, but otherwise, combat manages to flow fairly well. A few of the weapons are overblown, and fill up half the screen unnecessarily. The Scanner Visor is gone, and this is a major disappointment for me, as I thoroughly enjoyed the AI analysis of background items and enemy units. But otherwise, there's only a handful of nits with combat, but thos're easily overlooked given smart level design that can really make you think.

Voices are JRPG with some of the hookiness removed. They had to make a few bows to bizarre dialogue and pacing, but voices are good and conversations believable, though there are a few scenes that're simply weird. Graphics are a touch off, though mostly from overshadowing, but there is a good almost Resident Evil atmosphere of creepiness present, especially during certain scenes that'll make you hair stand up despite yourself.

Overall, this is classic Metroid, reinvigorated with an actual voiced cast and an introspective Samus, who's been rather devoid of personal input thus far. While I'm annoyed at the a few of the changes, overall the core gameplay is there, backed up by a well put together story that manages to be genuinely creepy at times.

Before the release there was some bitterness of the L4D community saying ""Boycott L4D2"" because we didn't get what we were promised..or what have you. I was a bit skeptical of these claims. I played L4D2 The DEMO and wasn't very impressed. Good but not amazing, yet still i bought L4D2 and i was NOT disappointed!!

MAPS
Let me just say the demo does NO justice for the game. The new maps are brilliant. For instance, the HARD RAIN campaign takes place in a very stormy New Orleans. The place is filling up with water, hard winds pushing you as you struggle to kill zombies. By time you get back you are knee deep in water. Other maps lead you through swamp lands to an authentic looking plantation house, another where jets are bombing around you, and one more FUN map taking place in a theme park where yes, you can play some of the games in the park. Overall the maps are fun, creative, and challenging.

NEW ZOMBIES
Even more challenging is the addition of new special infected to attack your team. There is now a Spitter(spits acid good), a Charger(charges and knocks down players), a Jockey(jumps on player to control them), and the old favorites: the hunter(jumps and attacks), smoker (pulls players away), boomer (spits zombie attracting goo) and of course the dreaded Tank(a killer hulk)  plus witch(crying killer) who now will walk around, not just sit as she did in the previous L4D. It is a TEAM game, so if a player goes solo, they likely will die. Team work for the win.

NEW MODES
If that's not enough for you they have also added some more modes. Realism mode does not highlight your team mates making it more difficult to differentiate zombies from players as well as make it very difficult to find them if you stray from the team. Less items are found and when a  player dies you won't see them again until you reach the check point. Competitive mode is a survival vs zombies fight where the survivors must accomplish a task while the other human team of special infected try to stop them. They still have versus mode as well as survival mode too.

NEW CHARACTERS
The characters are all new, although i must say the last group was more fun. They had better lines, who could not love Francis (i hate buses. i hate water. i hate everything) or the old war vet, zoey, or crazy louis. The new characters obviously couldn't be the same - it wouldn't make sense. The AIs also seem to be more stupid than the last. However it may depend on settings. On realism normal, Coach was a complete moron who would literally attack the witch when we were all trying to avoid it and run off randomly. However in Expert all AIs seemed to be on top of killing special infected.

NEW ITEMS
Melee weapons, you have to give up your pistols but it's totally worth it. Nothing like slicing and dicing using a machete or axe. Or how about a chainsaw? Also new guns, lots of options and way more hardcore then the previous. In addition to the old faves(pipebomb, molotov) there's now boomer bile to get zombies to attack each other. Also there's now adrenaline shots to make you faster to run through a horde or revive players. That's right, REVIVE. IF you have a defibrillator you can zap them back to life. No more waiting for them to respawn.

ACHIEVEMENTS FROM STEAM
There's also a whole new set of achievements from STEAM which will keep you playing the game just to get all the requirements on the list. They also track your stats such as accuracy, maps played, zombies killed, etc.

PATCHES
As with any software, there are always bugs and problems found in the beginning as players go through it. Most of these problems seem to have been fixed. They have also been pretty quick about fixing the discovered map exploits on a few maps. New free of charge patches come in time to improve the game.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this game is definitely worth getting and you won't be able to stop playing. If you haven't bought L4D1 i suggest you buy the double pack on STEAM. Get both games for about $65.

5,False,"11 15, 2009",A16I1TNBSOLQFG,B002BRZ9G0,Tristan A. Hayes,"New Super Mario Bros Wii is an experience that every fan of the classic 2D Mario games may want to purchase and play.  It features the same sort of game style that we have come to expect from all of those classic Mario games and combines most of their mechanics into one game.  It uses mechanics that were seen in Super Mario World 2 with the ability to ride Yoshi, some of the music choices from those games, some of the level designs and mechanics from Super Mario Bros 1, 2, and 3, and uses their music.  It is loaded with so many references and uses of enemies, items, and mechanics that it brings a smile to my face everytime I play through a level.

Playing the game is really quite simple. First there are three modes of gameplay; the main story in which up to 4 people can take control of the characters (Mario, Luigi, and two toads), and progress through the levels (even with more than one player, the levels can be progressed through and unlock more).  There is a free for all mode in which everyone is competing for score, and a coin battle mode in which you compete for score. Free-for-all and coin battle only work on stages that have already been cleared.

The game is essentially easier with one player for one doesnt have to worry about other players pushing them into obstacles nor do they have to worry about what the other players are doing or the number of powerups they take from you.  There are some benefits such as being able to ground pound simultaneously to clear the enemies off the screen, or jump on each other to read greater heights. It can be fun with more people if everyone is on the same page and not just throwing each other around and pushing obstacles into them (and its a great crutch to use since it essentially equates to at minimum of 5 lives per player on screen if a level is that hard).  For single players there is a super guide function which has Luigi take over and complete the level for you, if you die eight times on a stage.

Control wise, there are two styles of play, single wii-remote and wii-remote and nunchuk.  Controls are easy to grasp and I won't go into detail here, but there are what I consider waggle controls (shake the Wiiremote and the character will spin to go a little bit further when making a jump, shake it to move closer if you are floating on a stage, and lastly, shake it to lift obstacles).  The controls are easy to grasp and not too difficult.

Presentation wise, the graphics are excellent for the game and get the job done.  Sure it isn't a game that is graphical defining on the Wii but they do look crisp and clear for a game set in the Mario Universe. Most of the good looks here is the chance to see nostalgic enemies and environments in a new 480p light. Soundwise, nothing new hear in terms of sounds for the Mario universe, Mario and Luigi appear to have the same soundbites (Toad sounds just the same as they were in Super Mario Galaxy), songs sound either remixed from their classic counterparts or are all memorable.  Nintendo seems to have delivered a great experience in terms of presentation here.

-------
The bottom line is that NEW Super Mario Bros Wii is an excellent addition to the Mario Universe and brings back the feelings of odd with the series.  The gameplay is excellent, being able to play with friends on these levels is a great experience (locally, though the lack of online co-op for this is questionable though not worthy of scrutiny) but doesnt leave people who have no one to play with lacking the ability to complete the game, and the presentation Nintendo offers us here in terms of music and graphics is worth its weight in gold.  For those who haven't bought a Wii game since Super Smash Bros Brawl (yes there are a few of us) as well as for those who are looking for  an excellent single player and multiplayer experience on the Wii, New Super Mario Bros is a game to get.

Single Player:
While the Campaign is better than Halo 3's and ODST (and of course always enjoyable with friends) it provides little new and in some cases even recycles old levels from prior Halo games. The new abilities are fun, and the space battle was a gimmicky distraction, but there's really only a couple of new weapons and exactly zero new enemies to fight. While it's nice to fight intelligent and difficult Elites again, Reach really would've went out with a bang if they included boss battles, scarab fights (a massive highlight in Halo 3) or introduced some new enemy types that haven't been played out to death over the last 4 installments.

As far as story goes, Halo jumped the shark when it was revealed The Little Shop of Horrors controls all the flood and Reach continues that nosedive.

Multiplayer:
In terms of Multiplayer, there are only a few largely uninspired maps available on disc that lack any aesthetic diversity or strategy (e.g. team slayer = grab power weapons and camp). Most of what you'll play are Forge World creations or maps that look and feel similarly to those (outside of the Covenant Ship level, a rehash of Halo 2's Midship). There's not a single snow, jungle, desert, rain forest, moon, volcano, tropical island, beach or mountain top level to speak of. Not even a recreation of classics like Zanzibar and Beaver Creek. Additionally, they've completely removed vehicles from 4v4 slayer and have lumped single player objective and single player slayer into one playlist called ""Rumble Pit."" So, if all you want is the classic Halo experience be prepared to have to endure tons of annoying and poorly conceived Juggernaut and Infection game modes instead of being able to play what you actually want (NOTE: Bungie moved Infection to its own playlist, making Rumble Pit a more enjoyable experience).

On a positive note, Invasion is a great game type (especially Invasion Slayer which is simply the best idea Bungie has had) and the inclusion of credits, new armor pieces and the daily challenges are awesome and keep the game's replayability up. Furthermore Bungie is an active participate in the community and makes changes based on usage data, such as putting Team Swat in it's own list. This benefits both the people that love and hate that game mode simultaneously.

Firefight:
I don't understand the point of Firefight Matchmaking. This was the best aspects of ODST and while that Classic Firefight option remains in a non-credit earning, challenge completing, matchmaking aspect, the main matching system only allows you to play ONE ROUND with infinite lives. Where's the fun and/or challenge in that?

Forge World:
Easily the best aspect of this game as it expands on Halo 3's innovative Forge design by allowing you to build your levels from the ground up in a massive world rather than be limited to existing maps. The file share system is great and though clunky at times, it's rewarding to make your own map and play it with friends.

Conclusion:
While there are pretty cool ideas (credits, Forge World and Invasion) the game is largely a gimmicky cash-in riddled with rehashed, tired ideas and lacks the polish, content and new ideas that Bungie's faithful deserves.","Decent, but not quite the send off this 9 year series deserved",1287014400,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was looking forward to the turn based unit strategy but even though I knew this game had changed styles, I had to get it out of love for the franchise (And I don't regret it).

On that note,
-Graphics were very well done and believable, lots of facial expression, bullet damage, impact, etc. were displayed, although some more detailed than others.
-Sound was to par, the soundtrack went with the game very well and helped with immersion at some moments. I never found myself annoyed with the music or sound effects.
-The gameplay  was fast paced, responsive, and challenging (on the hardest difficulty) which required some tactical planning before heading in guns blazing. You really need to pay attention to your armor when in combat, enemies will tear through your limbs but luckily the core regenerates, so keep cover close. However, on foot (yes there are foot-soldier missions) it is practically impossible to die, just try not to run out of ammo.
-Probably one of the best things of FM, in my opinion, are customization. Much like Armored Core, you get to build and customize your own Wanzer (Huge Combat Robot, everyone loves giant robots). Though the campaign puts some limitations on your choice of weapon and mobility for some missions to mainly prepare for what's going to happen in the next mission.
-Story and characters were believable, except the protagonist, ANNOYING beyond belief...and slightly comical. The story is relatively short and not too many plot twist or points of extreme interest but the development of the main character is short and sweet, and the rest of the main cast are attractive and likable.

Now the downside; as stated before the gameplay can be challenging on the hardest difficulty but the most annoying thing is getting your legs destroyed to their frames and you can hardly move. After the climax of the story, this will happen constantly! Repair kits become rare/hidden so tactics become more prominent. The story was short and linear, not too much excitement. Don't even think about multiplayer, there likely will never be anyone online and if they are, they are well ahead of you so move on to armored core for multiplayer. Frankly I'm surprised the server is still up. The hidden unlockables (which give you extra credits and the occasional part/skill) were an absolute nightmare to collect and not really worth it, so unless you want every part in the game and a serious access of credits, forget them.

So, my final points:
-If your a fan of Front Mission, give this one a shot, it sticks to lore and is another prospective on an otherwise fantastic series.
-If you just wanna fight with robots, move on to another robot-smashing-game.
-If you're interested in just the story, move on, not much of that here.",Time Well Spent with a few Let Downs,1357689600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I must say it took me about a week to really appreciate the subtle changes that 2k10 has made.

1) The oops off the glass to a team mate or to yourself is a plus... and the Put back Slams are nuts.

2) The ratings of  team are no longer high so there is no 1 dominant team, every team can be a threat.

3) Smoother Online play.

4) Improved defense... and the stamina meter makes is so people can't run around all day with KOBE, LEBRON and D WADE all game like in 2k9.

5) Smarter AI this year it actually feels like you're playing a real person... The computer ain't dumb no more they'll make the extra pass to the open man or make you pay for a blown defensive cover.

6) My player mode gives the game more playability no longer just a season or online game and it actually improves your basketball IQ for playing in Crews mode or Team Matches.

7) Being able to use your created player online is also a plus .

8) The dribbling is crazy you can literally break defenders down, make them slip trip and everything else and it looks real not all arcadish.

Cons:
1) GLITCHES... you got a fast break going in for the stuff and your dude takes the slowest 2 steps to the basket in the world... Not all the time but it takes away from the smoothness of the game.

2) There are other delays here in there sometime the Ref and the Person taking the ball out tend to play Catch back in forth for like 30 of 40 seconds.. whats that all about. And there are a few other things that can affect game play here and there.

All in all I like this game it just feels more real to me than other B-Ball games. In my opinion it provides for the most realistic NBA experience. The game play is spot on.

3,False,"08 2, 2011",A2WPFQ8ZF9Z52P,B002CZ38KA,Chad Josselyn,"This game isn't really a game; it's perfectly described as an interactive drama, where your actions ultimately determine the direction and the outcome of the story.  You play as multiple characters, although it didn't feel like you were ever perceiving the world through their eyes; more like you were there to make sure if they advance in the story or not.  There are no game over's in this game; if a character dies, than the story moves on without them and it ultimately effects the outcomes of future events throughout the game.

Now this all sounds interesting, but the aspects that makes this a game are a tad lacking.  The most control you have over the character is where they walk and what order you perform simple tasks.  The controls aren't that great, and all action sequence is a series of complicated button prompts that you have to hit in sync.  While it drives up the anxiety you feel to match the feeling of the character you are controlling, it's not really that fun.  The button prompts are frustrating and an eye sore, and it feels like you are playing twister with your hands on the control pad.

The game is short, and is a one time play through for most.  Plus the story and plot has been seen before in plenty of crime thrillers in the past.  I for one thought the ""twist"" made no sense with what was going on with prior events within the game.  I was left asking, ""What was the point of the Origami Killer doing all of that before revealing themselves?""  I'm trying to be ""spoiler free"", otherwise I would go into more detail.

Which means it was a very enjoyable experience and I recommend anyone to check it out. Having played Indigo Prophecy, this developer's first endeavor with adventure games to my knowledge, I can thankfully say this game has much deeper characters, a richer plot, and way more branching consequences than its predecessor. Heavy Rain will quickly pull you in to a captivating story surrounding a serial killer. It brings together four characters, each playable, each with their own twist on the plot, and each fighting for their lives at one point or another. Unlike Indigo Prophecy, this game truly has no game overs. Instead, your actions have dire consequences on the story itself. Even the smallest detail can change the story drastically. Failing one action sequence can literally mean the difference between life and death for one of your characters. Regardless of the outcome the story will play on to its grand finale. That being said, there are some very obvious glitches in the game which really should have been worked out before its release. Especially the audio. Also the story, as captivating as it is, still has some very serious holes in the plot which I won't get into because I don't want to spoil the game. It's also pretty short, which is expected when a story can go as many different ways as this one does. Nonetheless, Heavy Rain is a solid game through and through and an extremely welcome breath of fresh air for a stale game market of FPS and action games. I can only pray this company will continue to deliver this different kind of experience in the future.

4,True,"08 27, 2011",A67N34SB26OAF,B002D2DQL8,Habib,"I initially bought this game because it was so cheap.  The short part of my review is that if you like RPG's, then spending $12 on this game is a no-brainer; it's totally worth it.  Even if you're new to the genre, it's probably worth a try.

I noticed a couple of very interesting things about this game when I started playing it.  For one thing, it's not a top tier production.  It's not one of those RPG-lite, dazzle-your-pants-off eye candy fests like many popular RPG's today (Final Fantasy comes to mind).  This game has character; the graphics are not unbearably amateurish--they're passably professional, but just barely.  It's one of those games that's kind of bad, but you like it because it's unique and ends up offering you more than you expected, and it keeps calling you back.  If the game lacks anything in style, it more than makes up for it in substance.  The more I play this game, the more I am pleasantly surprised by discovering its unfolding depth, and I'm slowly becoming convinced that this is perhaps the best RPG for the Wii among the best RPG releases in recent memory.  That's not to say it's a perfect 10, but it succeeds in areas that higher budget RPGs often fail.  This is more of a meat-and-potatoes RPG--it's nutritious and filling even if bland.

Somehow this game has managed to pull off a really old-school RPG feel that turns turns out to be extremely satisfying.  It offers up a solid, no-frills experience that is sure to please vets of the genre.  This is how I remember RPG's being when I was a kid; not because of the graphics, but the way the game plays, is organized, presented, and things like the dialog and characterization.  The lack of voice acting is a godsend; I'm sick of games with obnoxious voice acting.  With this game you just have to read the dialog and let your imagination take flight; this makes the game more relaxing.

There is absolutely no excuse for a modern game like this one to not have a Windowed mode of any sort.  Even Grand Theft Auto 4 had windowed mode.  At the very least, Dead Rising 2 can be forced into windowed mode via a third party program, but it makes the mouse cursor disappear, forcing you to navigate by keys alone, or blindly.

But that's the least of the frustrations inherent in this game.  It's also the first game that's caused me to angrily smash my keyboard and scream in frustration since I stopped being a child and mostly grew up.  For reasons I cannot begin to comprehend, the game has no autosave feature, and you can only save at bathrooms, which are shockingly not nearly as common as they are in real life, so any time I get trapped in a big dumb horde of zombies and killed, or the game decides to crash, or I fail a mission by running out of time, I have to re-start from my last manual save.  On four straight occasions, I had to redo the same set of missions due to exactly this.

Getting it out of the way early, the story.  I'm only about two hours in, and I already could not conceivably care less about anyone here except for two survivors I picked up, LaShawndra and her pusillanimous husband Gordon, and I interacted with them for all of a 4 minute miussion.

I have no idea what they were intending with the characters, but they come across as stereotypes at best, and grating irritants at worst.  In particular, the women.  Video games and misogyny have a fun and delicate relationship, but I must have been lucky to go so many years without such a startlingly blatant, on-the-nose, completely un-self-aware example in a game (Duke Nukem and the like are obviously comic over-the-top nuttery) such as I've found in this one.

There are two main female characters I've encountered thus far:  Stacey, the activist leader of C.U.R.E. who are against abuse of zombies for some odd reason, and portrayed without a hint of irony as a strong-willed, spirited dame just looking for a big strong man to tame her.

The other is Rebecca Chang, whom they've gone so over the top with making her a Femme Fatale that she comes across as a complete and utter raging bitch.  It gave me no amusement at all when a cutscene had her blatantly bending over and a subtle zoom in on her butt, and she spends the rest of her time constantly berating you and acting 'sassy' and blas when a huge horde of zombies swarm in on us.

The only other female characters worth mentioning are the twins from the prologue, reinforcing the misogyny by being intentionally designed to be complete and utter raging bitches, with nothing but insults to the main character, regardless of whether he wins the opening Terror In Reality game or not.

Then there's the cutscenes.  For the prologue and first mission I literally sat through more cutscene time than game time.  There's way too many cutscenes, which flow poorly, drone on with background mess and clutter, sometimes interrupting gameplay sequences, and overall could easily be replaced with a quick text notification.  In particular, the cutscenes advertising the first maintenance room where you can combine weapons actually took longer than it did to actually combine two things into a new weapon.

At the very least, these cutscenes are all skippable, but when they hit right in the middle of action, they can be distracting.

Now, to the gameplay.

The concept is good, and most of the time, picking up random garbage (sometimes literal garbage) and hitting zombies with it (or throwing it) is fun, and there's a real incentive to actually ""upgrade"" weapons, such as combining nails with a bat or tying a machete to a broomstick, but the fun only lasts as long as the weapon does.  And the weapons always break.  And there's absolutely nothing you can do to repair them or make them last longer.

In fact, given the sometimes arbitrary nature of some of the combinations (as in, you can attach a machete to a stick, but not any other blade), and other combinations that are little more than funny gimmicks, like combining fireworks with a lizard mask, and putting it on a zombie so the mask shoots fireworks.  The amusement lasts only as long as you realize it does no damage and actually draws more zombies towards you.

I've literally had instances where I completely gave up and dropped my newly-crafted weapons (like the Snow Cannon, fire extinguisher plus super soaker) for a big wooden stick because it's just not good enough for the situation.  The weapons are frilly and gimmicky, but when the game throws scores and scores of zombies at you all the time, especially this early in the game, it's not worth dicking around with a weapon that is one-time use or only hits one zombie at a time when you need large area-of-attack weapons like sledgehammers or tomahawks just to get across a hallway.

Similarly, a lot of the combat animations seem poorly chosen, made just to look cool at the expense of gameplay or logic.  For one, when a zombie grabs you from behind, your characters makes the highly questionable choice of throwing his own body back to smash its head on the ground.  Most of the time, this means your character is throwing his own body back INTO the large group of zombies he was running away from.

Other animations, particularly certain special attacks, require an extra half-second or so for the character to do his wind-up dance, or the stupid recovery time from certain cool-downs or missed attacks.  And given the annoying nature of zombie grabs, it means that you're practically guaranteed to be grabbed by a zombie if you try to use a frilly special weapon that takes too long to ""deploy"", such as the Power Guitar.  Adding to the frustration is that to escape the zombie grabs, you have to wiggle your mouse side to side, and most of the time, you will lose a health point as soon as you're grabbed, meaning you could end up dying while trying to run through lines of zombies, and end up having to reload back to wherever you last manually saved.

For a big budget game charging full dollar, this is a bit much, though I would deem it all tolerable and yet still fun if not for the TIME LIMIT.

The basis of the story is, the military is coming into town in 3 days, so everyone just has to sit and wait, with Chuck maybe going out to save some survivors left out in the strip mall.  Except that Total Bitch Rebecca Chang airs a news report that implicates Chuck as a C.U.R.E. terrorist who unleashed the zombies on everyone, so Chuck has to go and find evidence that proves his innocence somehow.  As well, his daughter is infected, and needs daily doses of a medicine called Zombrex which bitten people can take and keep living as humans.

This time limit doesn't even run in real time; I went running from one end of the mall to the other, then outside, then to the arena, and rescued a redneck couple.  It took me at most 15-20 minutes total.  In-game, 3 HOURS had passed.  Even spending a few seconds saving to a new save slot had several MINUTES pass in-game.  And unlike games like Grand Theft Auto, the countdown clock doesn't display minutes as passing like seconds, but appears in allegedly real time.

As well, there's a time limit on every mission you're given, from the main quest to secondaries to rescuing survivors.  There's even a time limit on having NO MISSION AT ALL; in between two main mission quests, it said ""Stacey has nothing for you at this time"" and to wait for her to call me.  This tidbit was running down its timer even with no mission at all, and went down into the red before I received a text message from her calling me back to base, with barely enough time to go out anywhere from the starting area.  And the mission wasn't even urgent!

It makes sense to add some layer of realism in terms of survivor missions (as in, time is running out to save group A, while group B is closer, but if you go after group A, you might run out of time to save group B), but it creates for ridiculous issues when you start running out of time for non-emergency missions, or when you fail the entire game if you're 1 second late to your destination, literally at the door.

If it weren't for those damn timers, in a supposed sandbox game, I would've given this mess 3 stars.  Overall, it's a mess, and the graphics on the zombies and gore look rather cheap for a 2010 game.

On the plus side, the Psychopaths are absolutely perfectly written to be some of the absolute worst scum of the earth deserving to die in the absolute most slow, painful, vicious ways possible, as well as making them some of the most disgustingly unbalanced, overpowered bosses in the game.",Cheap mess,1381881600,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

The construction and weight are good and synching it to the xbox 360 was pretty easy (hold the button on the bottom and press the button on your 360, the mic's lights will flash variously).  And, of course, the whole reason to get a wireless mic is to avoid a litter of cords across the living room (VERY hazardous during Rock Band parties).

The microphone is probably the most popular instrument at parties.  Rock Band's karoke mode lets you a guitarist, drummer, keyboards, bass guitar, and vocalist all in the same living room.  Subtract one person if you are not using Karoke mode (karoke mode doesnt record band scores).  So, during Rock Band parties, the mic is a hit.  You can adjust the song's vocal track volume to hear your friend through the TV to a greater or lesser extent.

Now on to the conflicted part: I have very little vocal talent.  I do not have the ""x factor"" and I will never be an american idol; however, I do get a kick out of singing along in Rock Band.  However, I am not sure how well this mic works.  I can complete songs on ""easy"" but even pretty straightforward songs, I fail out even on medium.  Now, Im not sure if this is a reflection of how terrible I sing or if the mic is quirky. The mic does seem to have a hard time if I don't hold it pretty close to my mouth (like really close).

In summary: I would say, for the price, this wireless mic is a great addition for Rock Band parties.  If you are a serious vocalist, you may have better luck with the wired Rock Band 3 mic.  But if you're having fun with friends, get rid of cords and sing your hearts out!","Great for Parties, but Not Sure How Great It Is",1297641600,,{'Color:': ' Black'},

It is a marvelous alternative to the Madcatz Tournement Edition stick, particularly if you prefer Seimitsu push-buttons. If you prefer Sanwa, it is a bit more difficult to mod than the Madcatz TE. After such extended use, my HRAP sports some wear: there's some grinding around the stick's gate, and the cable's joint is now decked in electrical tape after it split from (I imagine) being wrapped tightly around the controller time and time again. In hindsight, this was not a good idea. However, in spite of its current weathered condition I am hesitant to replace it because I just love it so damn much. It's sturdy and heavy, responsive and metallic. Really, the controller is only slightly less heavy than the Xbox 360 itself, so if you are looking for a table-top controller that won't move around or a lap controller which will keep you firmly planted in your seat (and not blown away by the wind), Hori has got you covered. By all means if you are disappointed with the Madcatz brand, seek Hori as a substitute.

There is no way to see behind you when going in reverse, although you can see your avatar turn around, there is a rearview mirror in the cockpit mode but it actually displays what is in front of you(?).

If you hold a magnifying glass to the screen you can almost tell the icons are in fact different shapes. (circles for cops, hexagons for items, triangles for stunts). 95% of my time playing the game is spent desperately trying to navigate the map to find out what to do next, or driving around the city for hours tediously searching for things.

The levels in the game make no sense. You can tell Capcom Japan was behind it due to the random weird stuff. You wonder why the gaming scene in Japan is dying.. If the Japanese gamers don't like it then why would we want to be force fed this crap?

I should warn you that you'll need a pretty hefty computer to run it due to the new graphical demands and make sure you have high-speed internet so you can download the necessary install content from the mandatory Steam account you need to have. This curve ball aside, and some weird crashes on XP, the game is a masterpiece.

So, what's all the fuss about? Where to begin?

For fans of Medieval TW like me the anticipation of Empire was too much, but the product was panned by hundreds of loyal fans and I steered clear of it. NTW was given more praise and my real reason for buying it was, a) I love this period and b) naval combat. I've become a bit of a nerd for the love 18th and 19th century fighting ships and the chance to weild one of these beasts in combat was all too aluring. If you understand naval combat of the period, the game doesn't disappoint, although true sailors might be frustrated a little by a lack of data on hand. But, that does fit the era of seamanship in this period and reinforces the skill level of the captains and admirals in charge.

Graphically, and those running dual graphics cards and high-end systems must be revelling in it, the sea battles are fantastic. The ships lumber towards each other and you have options to fire broad-sides or different types of shot to cripple ships and or board the enemy. The distortion effects from cannon fire are particularly impressive. Bits of wood and splinters fly off the vessles and sails are shot away leaving you languishing for control. I managed to dismast an enemy recently, which was cool to watch.

Now, I must stress I've only had a few hours of game play and am still getting to grips with land battles and the ins and outs of naval combat, but my early impressions have been positive.

The first thing you notice is the campaign map which is just freaking awesome. I love the reduced time component, so that each turn is two weeks which provides a feeling of more control over events. The campaign map's color scheme changes more subtlely to suit the change in seasons and late autumn early winter is breathtaking.

The complexity of the build and research trees have changed a little and you can set what technologies you want to research with the help of the self-spawning gentlemen who pop up. You also have more control over your government and can sack ministers, recruit generals and admirals, and thus have more input into the structure and composition of your society.

I'm still mucking about with the English right now, again, because of their inherent sea power in this era, so there is much to explore yet.

If there is a fly in the ointment, it's the odd crashes I have experienced. Sometimes during turns, sometimes mid battle. The cause is a mystery and could be my system, but I get the black screen, which is better than the blue screen of death. Aside from this hassle, I really love it and  make sure i save it more regularly...I've not had this experience with Medieval TW, alas alack. Still, in terms of the total experience, in terms of government, settlement experience etc, and battles, the game provides a riveting experience and hopefully hours of game play which fans of the franchise should enjoy...","Awesome thus far, but you'll need a decent internet connection",1283126400,9,"{'Edition:': ' Limited', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

He then learns to interact with objects in his world (within limitations) to change the fate of events including reversing the death of other characters.

I did find that the actual puzzle solving time was limited and there was tons of dialogue to weed through. Sometimes you need the dialogue to figure out the puzzle but other times there are tons of not-so-subtle hints that show or tell you exactly what you have to do.

The story line is okay, humorous but a little mundane at times. The characters are funny and well animated. I especially laughed at the detective that dances like Michael and the security guard who did his little funky dance until you fixed something.

Each puzzle has to be solved in 4 minutes, the amount of time to reverse fate and save a life. You have the option of replaying from the last fate reversal or the beginning of the level. Some puzzles never need a second playthrough and others need a few as you try out different objects to see which one will interact as you need it to change fate.

I found the transition from dialogue to puzzles somewhat annoying as the screen displays a large graphic, ""Trick Time"" just in case you didn't know you had to solve something.

2,False,"10 27, 2010",A2B40ERM3QI6E,B0030F1DOO,Campy,"I've only played into this game for a few hours, but I already have a sense of what I bought into. SWTFU II is like the classic sequel: it's more of the same, shinier, but not necessarily conveying more.

The graphics look prettier, except that Starkiller's face model looks...off. In my opinion any way. The music is superb, the voice acting is just a continuation of the great voice acting in the first game.

The control scheme has been re-tightened, but not reworked. It is simply a fluid continuation of the first game, and while the camera has been reworked to be less ""wonky""  (a common complaint of the first game) and Starkiller runs...a bit slower...I was able to pick this right up and just hack stormtroopers with unparalleled gusto.

The feel of the game, truth be told, is a direct continuation more than a sequel. It feels almost like an expansion pack. Starkiller himself is as powerful as you might have left him off, re-gaining his force powers at a rather fast rate, making him somewhat unbelievably overpowered. I do not know if someone who didn't play the first SWTFU would be able to pick this game up and play this game with reasonable ease, as the game compensates this overpowered-ness with frantic gameplay and impossible odds. As a result, the gameplay feels somewhat uneven, in my opinion: one level in particular, some weird gambling citadel in Malastare, felt superbly long, and what's more, repetitive. And then, it had two boss sequences, which felt like a bit much. It could be argued that the story flow was not set up in a way that follows standard "" level- boss, level-boss, level-boss"" schemes, but that it sets up the action in a more natural, fluid, story-telling way...but the problem with that argument is that the story telling feels very thin-spread when compared to the original SWTFU. The premise of the protagonist being a clone starts feeling a bit contrived after a bit. In essence, to me at least, it runs out of gas, and we're left with superb gameplay set in repetitive encounters.

Sometimes a story will be so good that it will carry bad gameplay or bad level design, but that's not the case here. And the combination of great gameplay with great level design is a combination that has carried some of the more popular game franchises in the last few years. But in this case, incredible game play mechanics cannot compensate enough for a thinly spread storyline, provided for the sake of giving us an excuse to hack through endless hordes of incredibly stupid stormtroopers (given, there are other more devious enemies, and a lot of them are force resistant, but I have not gotten stumped in this game yet, save for a boss fight which was a bit uneven, in my opinion)

I still have  more to see of this game, and it has been incredibly fun, so far. But, to be honest, I had just as much fun playing SWTFU, and I was served with what I considered a very well written and scripted Star Wars side story to the original trilogy. This time around, it just feels a bit lacking.

Edit- As I kept playing on last night I encountered a series of bugs that at first were kind of funny, then they kind of detracted from the experience, and finally prevented me from going forward: When killing enemies, some of these would stick to the walls after being defeated, or would float away, at first. This was...comical. Then, at one point, I would come into a crowded room, and about half the stormtroopers were running into walls, walking on air, running through walls, dying and coming back to life ad nauseum, and some of them just floated out of reach, preventing me from clearing the room, which would have triggered the storyline to go forward, so I was stuck.

I don't know what this trend is to rush a product, but I really hope Lucasarts hotfixes this soon. I kinda wish I could return this and get some other game, honestly.

edit 2- after finishing the game, I had to adjust my rating from 3 stars to 2.  The game is, as everyone says, painfully short. One playthrough lasts about 4 hours. The ending, both endings, to me, are unsatisfying, to say the least. The final stages of the game are incredibly anticlimatic. I always thought that fighting Vader in the first game was an awesome way to go out, although the fight was tough as nails, but the final stages of this game fall incredibly flat. This game is just very disappointing. It fell short of every expectation I could have had for this game.  And it could be argued that Lucasarts has no obligation to meet my expectations, and the reverse could be said as well, that I am under no obligation to buy this game, but hey, I did. And I also traded it in before it was too late. At least I have Castlevania LoS.","Falls a bit short, classic sequel syndrome",1288137600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
4,False,"04 27, 2011",A2LPJD19MGBNXJ,B0030GBSUC,Adrian Jenkins,"I saw this game in a local K-Mart (yes, they still exist), and decided to pick it up for ten bucks. If I knew then what I know now, I would have paid 60 for it. The fact is, Yakuza 3 is one of the gems of the system.

I don't know about the Japanese version, or the cuts that were made. I would assume that the dating mini-game is expanded considerably. If this is the case, it's one of the best things Sega could have done. Maybe Mahjongg was fun, though.

Anyway, this is a review of the AMERICAN version of Yakuza, dependent only on the content found there. And that content, despite the cuts, is vast, and it is mostly excellent. Of course you have the main game, which is a great combination of JRPG and Final Fight (not Grand Theft Auto, as many people have claimed). Let's start with the fighting: it is excellent. Arcade-style brawler action really hits the spot. The controls are mostly tight, the moves are simple enough to allow for progress into the game, and complex enough to keep the player from getting bored. Even after over 300 random encounters, I still find myself enjoying the action. The finishing moves are great, the counter-attacks are fantastic, and the HEAT system (which I won't explain here - think of it as the special move system) is fantastic. I never get tired of seeing my character kick the crap out of enemies using special moves.

The bosses are generally difficult (at least on Hard difficulty), and require significantly better technique than the random encounter. Bosses fight differently, so don't expect that the same tactics will work all the time (although I find the dash-punch combo is pretty much unstoppable, as long as you're patient).

The JRPG aspect might put off some potential players, but I think it's great. It's equal parts hilariously cheesy and gripping. I won't spoil story, but you'll see what I mean. Dialogue can drag on, however, and because the game's language is Japanese, you are pretty much forced to sit and read subtitles continuously. I don't find it bad at all, but buyer beware - if you don't like your games talky, you might want to look elsewhere.

On top of the main game are numerous minigames, and for the most part, they are a blast. I thoroughly enjoyed the pool and golf minigames, and the karaoke rhythm game is hilarious. A fishing minigame seems almost required in Japanese RPGs, and this one is actually pretty fun. There are also batting cage minigames, darts, an arcade, etc. These aren't quite as fun as the two I mentioned, but they are well above passable. All in all, they paid attention to the minigames, and it shows. Woven into many of these mingames are subplots. There is a long hitman mission that essentially has you fighting some extra bosses. This is OK, but I found it tiresome after 10 extra bosses or so. There are also random stories which can be engaged by talking to people on the street. These are a mixed bag. Most of them end up involving a standard random fight at the end, which is somewhat unexciting. There are a few exceptions (I enjoyed the movie subplot, e.g.), but all in all, the fun lies mostly in finding these missions, not playing them. There are other collectables in the game (e.g. there are 100 locker keys hidden across the two cities, and many of these are nigh impossible to find on your own), but this mostly wraps up the game description.

All in all, I love this game. So, why the star deduction? Well, there are certain elements that just don't cut it. There are numerous chase scenes in the game. I hate them (particularly at night time). Generally, they require you to memorize the terrain in order to catch the perpetrator, and this really lacks the heart-pounding excitement you would expect. In one particularly odious encounter, I was trying to avoid cops, but kept running the wrong path. It didn't really matter, as I could just retry the whole thing, so what's the point?

The camera often betrays you. There is no devoted ""lock-on"" within the game. Rather, you can take a fighting stance, which kind of targets your punches. The problem is that at times, the camera will just drift and you can't see your opponent. At times, the bosses can be cruel, and losing track of them can really hurt you. In the same vein, the computer just cheats sometimes. Occasionally, you will be forced to go through QTEs while fighting bosses. These themselves are fine, but the problem is that they govern cut scenes. Too often, the cut scene drags a bit, and when you regain full control of your character, the enemy has already launched into a combo. Cheap as hell, but what are you going to do?

The in-game map is a real problem It would have been nice to be able to place points on your map for particular hotspots. Instead, I find that I have to constantly return to the map in the pause menu. This map itself is not particularly user-friendly, mind you, but it's a real pain to constantly refer to this thing, and you'll be doing it a lot.

But all in all, you really can't go wrong with this one, particularly for the current sweet price. I would highly recommend it overall, and I hope that Persona 5 takes a cue from this for its in-town interactions.",A great game that should not be overlooked,1303862400,3,,

This game has very few shortcomings.  It has been (in each version) very stable, rarely bogs down.

About half the time I ended up taking a hit because I didn't realize the fighting had started again.

3,False,"02 15, 2011",AFD9XJBA7LOH2,B003JVF728,Ryan J.,"I've owned the 360 version since xmas and I decided to purchase the PC version because of dedicated servers and the keyboard/mouse controls, however, the game fully supports the 360 gamepad.

The graphics are definitely better than its 360 counterpart, which is expected. The single player campaign is identical to the 360 version and is much better than the MW2 campaign (imo, of course). Also, playing with dedicated servers removes any host advantage like on the 360's multiplayer component.  The PC version, for me, is just as fun as the 360 version but even with the dedicated servers (which is a huge plus in my book), there are still some issues that really bug me.

The method of finding servers (via server browser) feels really basic and antiquated. Of course  you can filter by map types, game types, empty servers, and full servers. However, there's no ability to filter by ping or region. I can overlook those issues, but what really annoys me is when I load COD: BO and click server browser (or even ranked match), COD: BO will have about a 75% chance of freezing and the only way I know how close the game when this happens is to terminate the process using task manager (ctl+alt+del).

Still, once the game is loaded and I'm happily fragging away the game will occasionally freeze momentarily (about 1-2 sec) then resume. It's like I suddenly lost connection, but this feels a little different. For you programmer types, it's like the whole client decided to pause and do garbage collection. This usually results in a death unless I'm lucky enough for it to happen when no enemies are around. This freeze sucks and a fix for this should be a top priority for Treyarch, but I will tolerate it unlike the server browser freezing the game.

Not to wish that this game was any more of a console port, but there are some things that are in the 360 that I wish were in the PC version:

1. being able to update/create a class loadout between matches. Currently, I have to leave the server to update my classes.

2. multiplayer lobbies. I'm not saying peer to peer networking like MW2, but it would be nice to have a lobby (imo) between maps. I know it's doable because valve was able to implement both lobbies and dedicated servers with the l4d series.

Currently, between maps there's only a 10 second break before the next match starts. It would be nice if there was a 20 second break between maps, while in a lobby, displaying which map is next in the rotation. Additionally, the players could vote to skip the next map if the majority voted for it. Of course, this should be an option that could be set by the admin.

Overall, I really enjoy the game, but there's less polish in this PC version over the 360 version. Unfortunately, while I'm sure the developers at Treyarch are a bunch of swell guys, I doubt they will fix the issues or add any features that I described above.

When the game works, the multiplayer action is 10x faster and more frantic than the 360 version. It's been stated that the multiplayer population has declined since its release, but there's about 10,000-20,000 on most evenings when I'm playing. That's probably less than a quarter than the amount that's on XBOX LIVE, but it's more than enough to find a match anytime of the day at a location of your choice (provided the server browser doesn't freeze the game). At the very least, there's always Combat Training to simulate the the multiplayer experience via bots.

For me, the game play is fun 5/5, but the game itself is only 2/5 due to the lack of polish and missing features that are present in the 360. If the freezing issues were fixed, then this is definitely a 4 star game in my book.","Fun gameplay, subpar execution",1297728000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC'}",

New game play experience:
1.  I find background music helps the game be more engaging.
2.  Each character has its own pros and cons, thus you need to understand them by trial and error, and develop different gameplay strategy.
3.  Overall, when dealing with your enemies, you are ""hit and run"".  The more difficult the game level, the more running you will do.
4.  There are different defensive choices, but I find myself using the hp regen all the time, so don't waste your upgrade on any other defensive strategies.
5.  Regular blocking is good enough even at hard difficulty level, so no need to have those fancy defensive moves, save your upgrade for offensive moves.
6.  Since you must have companion, you can experiment on your companions with different upgrade, thus find the optimal combination before you choose that character.

Still very annoying features:
1.  With exception of the very last merchant, you get powerful weapons by killing your enemies than from buying them.  I only buy rings from merchants.
2.  Non-boss enemies and chests are dropping useless weapons.  Good for selling them for trophy or achievement.
3.  The game is still way too short compare to similar games like God of Wars or Diablo.
4.  Hate to repeat this, but this is the most annoying part, even with powerful weapon, I am still doing rolling and running.  That's the theme, and that's the only moves you will ever do in this game.

I can't remember any other fps(Uncharted 1&2 not included-not fps) with a better story although its not really a highlight,  just an added story to keep it more interesting and a way to somewhat care about what happens and the characters.  In a fps don't we just want to shoot stuff?  This one has a great balance to me.

Matter of fact,  it is going to be one of the reasons that I will probably play through the game again and maybe twice more.  I have never played any other game through more than once besides Uncharted 2.  And playing with the weapons in this one to level some of them up more is a great thing about this game.  The gameplay and combat is just fantastic.  The AI is smart and will hunt you down and its also a good way to hide then attack.  It can be very challenging at times and makes you think and strategize.  You can run and gun and hide and seek and its all very interesting because of the smart enemies.  Perfect?

Pros:

-Gameplay and gameplay and more gameplay.  Amazing combat.
-Environments look good and the surroundings and atmosphere are engaging and fun with lots of variety.
-Lots of enemies with good variety.
-Amazing weapons - great leveling up of each that wants you to play the game again.
-A need to use different weapons in certain situations.  All weapons are good so there is really not one that dominates,  so to me,  I want to play through again to focus on other weapons to level them up more.
-Better than expected multiplayer - much better than the beta and they have,  at least in my case,  fixed a lot of the lag and errors and matchmaking issues.
-Did I mention gameplay and combat?
-Great controls and feel.
-Replayability with some cheats available after beating the game once.  You can have unlimited ammo,  auto healh re-gen and more.

-Well,  not a lot of cons to me but its not perfect.
-Weapon wheel controls are a bit annoying and hard to pick 2 at the same time.

4,False,"02 3, 2014",A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B003O6EATE,Tsanche,"Let's rewind the clocks back for a moment.  In 2005, Sony released the PSP.  At the time it was the most powerful handheld on the market.  It did some incredible things.  The specs were on part with the PS2, it could play music and movies... and yet for quite some time we could only talk about the ""potential"" it had for video games.  As time waned on many of the PSPs best games were either ports from the PS2 or games that were ported to the PS2 (Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories).  As a device it was fantastic.  But as a gaming system it took a lot longer than it should have to take off.  Eventually we did get some good, worthwhile software.  Despite selling moderately well and being a great piece of hardware, Sony just didn't seem all that crazy about pushing the gameplay experiences you could have with the device.

And now history is repeating itself.

The Playstation Vita is by far one of the greatest handheld gaming devices that you can find.  The hardware in and of itself is pretty impressive.  The graphical presentation of games is fantastic, but more than that... the user interface is pretty amazing as well.  It's almost like carrying around a Playstation 3 from time to time.  The user interface ditches the XMB used by the PSP and PS3 in favor of icons similar to apps on a smartphone menu.  Tap one and you can launch apps, games or your internet browser.  You can also sign in to the PSN and look at your trophies (on either PS3 or Vita).  You can also use your Vita for remote play on your PS3 or PS4.  It's a fascinating device.

There are four face buttons (the classic square, triangle, circle and cross buttons) and a D-Pad.  But the nice little addition here is the inclusion of two analog sticks for your gaming pleasure.  Considering the kind of games the Vita can handle, having two will make a great deal of gaming experiences pretty simple (especially with rotating cameras).  There is an L and R buttons as well.  The other thing that makes the hardware pretty nice is the use of touch screens.  On the front the screen is also a touch screen.  So you can always tap on icons to utilize them as well.  Just the same, this function is also used in some games, though it isn't always to the benefit of the game you're playing.  Going beyond that there is also a touch panel on the back.  Again, this can also be used in gameplay, and again, not always to the benefit of the game.  But it's still a good idea if a developer ever makes good use of it.

The Vita makes for a pretty decent portable entertainment center all on its own.  There are a multitude of apps you can download for the device.  If you're interested in Netflix or Hulu, this will work out just fine for you as well.  The screen makes it so that everything is pretty crisp and clean.  The picture you get is very clear.  The speakers also work well.  There are a multitude of apps to download for the time being and so it's pretty clear that you can use the Vita for much more than just gaming needs.  You can also now play PSOne classics on it where the back panel acts as the L2 and R2 buttons.  The most perplexing drawback to the Vita is that there's not backwards compatibility for PSP games.  So if you've still got PSP games you enjoy you might want to consider holding onto your PSP before getting rid of it for a Vita.  You can download PSP games but there is hardly any point to paying money for the same game twice if your physical copy is still in fine working order.  At least downloading PSP games isn't terribly expensive in the event you find yourself in need to do so.

On the other hand this brings about the Vita's most aggravating flaw.  The fact that the memory cards are quite expensive and if you go the route of downloading games (or utilizing it for everything you can) you'll find it can eat up memory fast.  Even after the price drop, memory cards for the Vita can still be expensive.  Especially if you're looking for a lot of space.  Lastly, the battery life may not be totally sufficient.  Because of everything the Vita is it can eat away at the battery pretty fast.  Expect to have to charge it often.

All that aside the device itself is a great piece of hardware.  The only other problem is that it doesn't quite have the software to support the hardware in question.  Going back to the PSP for a minute, we spent quite a bit of time wondering where are the games.  The Vita is in a similar boat.  It's had enough time to find its footing, but it seems that there are still not a lot of good games for the Vita just yet.  It's great to have the bells and whistles, but at the end of the day I already have devices that can do the things the Vita can already do.  If you've got a smartphone or a tablet you'll find that there isn't much point to getting a Vita if you're looking for good gaming experiences.  You might find use if you travel a lot, but that's about it.  A lot of good Vita games are already on the PS3 or 360.  Want to play games like Mortal Kombat, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Rayman Legends or the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection?  Already readily available on the consoles.  The Vita doesn't have too many games it can call its own.  It's a fantastic piece of hardware... but I'm still waiting for a gaming experience to come out that can make the Vita more worthwhile.  I don't mind an entertainment center in my pocket (although you'll probably be investing in cases, screen protectors etc.) but I didn't buy a Vita JUST to have an entertainment center in my pocket.  I'd really like some great games to play and this is the area where the Vita seems to be lacking most severely.  It's hard to convince a gamer to buy a particular device (even a handheld one) if you can't provide the software for it.  They're often the bread and butter of what makes a gaming console or handheld so worthewhile to begin with.  All the other things my Vita does I have devices for and more.  But what those things wouldn't be able to do that my Vita can is provide a gaming experience I won't find on a tablet or a smartphone.  And with the hardware capabilities it also means that I could have an experience that a console might not be able to provide.

All that being said, the Vita IS a great piece of hardware.  It is amazing just how much power will literally be in the palm of your hand.  If it had great software to accompany the great hardware it would be a fantastic device to have.  As it stands now, it's hard to recommend the portable device for those who are really looking for unique gaming experiences.",Great Hardware That Would Be Better With Great Software,1391385600,3,,

You are Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton agent sent to the floating city of Columbia in 1912. Your task is to find a
mysterious girl named Elizabeth and return her to New York unharmed. Seems easy enough, right? Wrong. During your journey in Columbia, you'll really question your motives and learn more about who Elizabeth really is, and why these people want her so badly. I won't spoil anything, but the story of Bioshock Infinite is fantastic, and you'll really grow to love these characters. The ending is truly satisfying, and it doesn't leave any questions unanswered.

The visuals in Bioshock Infinite are amazing, and they really help to suck you into this immersive world. As you're shot up into the sky and see Columbia for the first time, you'll be left in awe at this gorgeous place. Many people roam around the city, filled with cheer. But you'll soon come to realize what a horrible place Columbia really is. Its people hate foreigners of any kind, hurting or even killing any person that isn't white (provided they aren't already being forced to work in the factories). The citizens of Columbia worship the Founding Fathers, and are wholeheartedly devoted to their fanatical leader, Father Comstock. At one point in the game you'll even see people revering a statue of John Wilkes Booth! Some foreigners, tired of the discrimination and abuse of their races, make up the Vox Populi (""voice of the people"" in Latin), a ragtag group of common people who lead a civil war against the ultranationalist Founders, who blindly defend the Prophet. DeWitt is caught in the middle of all this, and doesn't want any part of it. Booker is a very cynical and reserved fellow, one who doesn't care much for the people of Columbia. But that all changes when he finds Elizabeth, an intelligent, optimistic young girl who has been locked up in a tower for all of her life. She tries to bring out the best in Booker, who has had a dark and troubled past. You'll quickly find that Elizabeth has an astonishing ability; she can open up tears in the environment, objects or weapons brought in from another dimension. These really change combat, as you can have Elizabeth conjure up some cover, a shotgun, or health kits and nearly any point. She'll also toss you ammo, coins, or salts (your fuel for using Vigors) at just the right time during combat. All of these don't make the game too easy, though: you'll find quite a challenge in Columbia on some of the higher difficulties.

One of the best new additions to Infinite was the Sky-Line system. With the push of a button, your character can use his awesome Sky-Hook to attach onto a Sky-Line and travel around Columbia in a fun and easy way. The controls on the Sky-Line are extremely intuitive, and you'll quickly learn your way around the sky. You can also use these to get an edge during combat, whether you slow down and do some precision aiming, go by your enemies in quick and lethal assaults, or even drop right onto them with a Sky-Line Strike. You can also use your Sky-Hook to perform brutal executions on your enemies when their health is low enough, and I'm sure you gore lovers out there will get some fun out of this.

There are many weapons available in Bioshock Infinite: this is a very good thing, but one of my major gripes with the game are that you can only carry two at once. This really limits some of your strategies during the game, and it can be quite frustrating if you keep on dying during a tough fight just because you didn't have the best tools for the job at hand. There are eight Vigors in total for you to use, and some of these are pretty cool. However, I didn't really use them that often: I played on Medium difficulty, and rarely ever needed to use them. That may not be the case for the higher difficulties, but so far for me, they haven't been all that useful so far. Many vending machines are scattered throughout Columbia, where you can buy health, salts, ammo, gun upgrades, vigors, and vigor upgrades. Money can be found all throughout Columbia, and I've noticed that enemies' bodies drop many more items than in the original Bioshock. When you die in Bioshock Infinite, there isn't really that much of a punishment: you simply lose some money, regain a bit of health and ammo, and respawn a few paces away from where you died. Your enemies regenerate a bit of health, too. There are 80 Voxophones (audio journal entries) and 37 Kinetoscopes (brief silent films) hidden throughout Columbia, and locating these will reveal much of the backstory, giving you a deeper understanding of Columbia. Bioshock Infinite is mildly difficult: I'm a decent gamer with a lot of FPS's under my belt, and I didn;t have a lot of trouble on Medium difficulty. Sure, there were some challenging bits, but nothing way too frustrating. However, for the ultra-hardcore gamers, there's 1999 Mode, a new difficulty level unlocked after your first completion of the game (or with a special code activated at the main menu). In this mode, you're severely punished when you die, enemies are much more lethal than before, items are scarce, and you don't take nearly as much damage as normal. I've heard that this is insanely difficult, and I'm sure that you hardcore gamers will get a kick out of it.

Overall, Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic game. The characters, visuals, voice acting, gameplay, and story are amazing, and it's a fun and perilous journey through Columbia. There are a few gripes that I have with the game, but in the end, they don't really detract from the overall experience that much. If you buy one game a year, then this should definitely be a consideration. If you're a huge singleplayer fan like me, then this should be right up your alley. Even if you're a more multiplayer-oriented player, then you should still give it a try! I promise you that it will be worth your while.

I was glad that after the massive success of the Guitar Hero & Rock Band franchises, something in the rhythm game genre was coming along for the hip hop fan. This second installment in the hopefully continuing DJ Hero series is an improvement over it's predecessor. My only complaint about this game is it doesn't pack as much of a punch as the original mix-list. Not to say this game doesn't have some very good mixes, because it certainly does, but it seemed to stray more toward the pop genre rather than keeping it hip hop. It's not a big let down, but still I find myself bobbing my head to the beat alot less in this game than I did in the original. Then there's the new features such as the ability to use 2 turntables, a mic, and the added freestyle sections that let you add your own little flavor to certain mixes that make this one stand apart from the original. Overall, being a fan of the rhythm game genre and a fan of hip hop, I hope they choose to release a 3rd installment of the series because it's a nice change of scenery from playing Guitar Hero & Rock Band.

1) Disconnection from Autolog. This is a rare situation but it does happen. Nothing sucks more than winning a match, making first place, getting around 15,000 points for it, unlocking new stuff only to be told you've been disconnected from Autolog and all that work in that one match went flush. Again, it's a rare situation but can be really offsetting when it does happen.

2) ""Auto Balancing Teams"". In two words: It doesn't. Case in point: Yesterday me and a friend were playing in the Sports area of NFS. I'm a level 11 cop and level 13 racer. He is a level 13 cop and level 12 racer. Everyone else in the lobby was around levels 3-4 on average. Time runs down and the match begins its auto balance. My friend and I end up on the same team, meaning two level 11+ racers and the most they had was a level 7 cop, the rest of the cops were level 1, 3, and 4. While levels may not make a huge difference, it does on useage of equipment (spike strips, heli's, and road blocks). Needless to say we won most of the matches for the next 2 hours.

3) Map selection in public lobbies. While it doesn't happen all the time, it does happen with frequency. The map selection needs to be tweeked. It's unfair to one team continuously throughout their time in that lobby. What I mean by this is one Racer team gets a 7-8 mile run map and when things switch, the other side gets a 12-16 mile map, and it continues like this on and on making it unfair to one side trying to survive as a Racer.

4) Lobby Lockup. Extremely rare but it's happened twice in all the matches I've played through. What happens is the lobby will lock up while ""auto balancing"" teams and nothing further will happen, essentially forcing everyone to exit that lobby in order to get back into the game.

But don't let all the above things steer you away from this excellent game. It is definitely a fun mixture of Need For Speed and the Burn Out series. Where NFS comes in is the licensed cars, merged with the arcade race/rampage of BurnOut.

Where this game is funnest is online. You can do this right out the gate and best of all, whether you win or lose matches your ""Racer"" and ""Cop"" will each gain experience (depending on which one you drove during that match up). This will, in turn, unlock better attacks and more vehicles.

There is either a love it or hate it feeling for this game based on your racing game experience. I personally like this kind of racing games because I love the idea of being the hunter or the hunted. The GT games are master pieces and are visually stunning with using real life simulation but I hate the idea of driving in circles or driving the same track over and over again and expecting something different. This sounds very similar to the definition of insanity. The racing concepts of need for speed hot pursue tie in the idea avoiding the police. This is also a real simulation for illegal speed racers everywhere but there is something different that can be expected each time you play. My only cons with the game is for single player you can not select a place, change the weather, add the number of cops you want, the difficulty of the CPU players and any car you want. The current configuration of the single player has you chose a place as a cop or racer with an already predetermined weather condition, number of CPU players and set difficulty already in place. This is something I did not like. The online play I have to say is very good considering you can play against a total 7 other players with very little lag. When you play a fast paced racing game you would expect some kind of lag but their servers must be great. Overall, I would highly recommend you rent this game before you buy it.

If you've got a musical background, you've got a slight jump on others, but a skilled gamer may do just as well by simply pushing the right key when the indicator reaches the target!  The genius of the software is that as long as you push the right keys at the right time, you hear the original performance intact.  If you mess up, your part (here, the keyboards) goes silent, and you hear ""clunks"" (like a ""dead"" key on a traditional piano).

A variety of skill levels and two modes of keyboard play (basically, one uses only five keys on the keyboard, the other uses nearly the full keyboard) makes this fun for just about everyone, and offers great opportunities for continuing to play the game for months and years ahead.  In the ""Pro"" mode, you're playing along with the music based on indicators on an on-screen keyboard (the game doesn't use musical notation).

The game comes with a decent variety of songs, and there are thousands of additional titles available for purchase (typically the equivalent of $1 or $2 each, in Microsoft Points).  Most are rock (many heavy metal), but there's a good selection of 70s rock, 80s pop, and a few country and classical piano tunes.

The keyboard itself feels very substantial, but is light enough to be easy to use.  The keys feel very much like a ""regular"" MIDI keyboard.

Hook up a microphone, and you've got a top-end karaoke machine.  If you've got a second mic or more instruments, that's when you can create your own band at home.

Guess it's because he and I watch it faithfully every night. He and I have had a lot of fun playing WOF so far. Since he's only 10, I have a bit of an advantage over him when solving puzzles,  but we stick with the easy level - he does pretty well on his own, though I do occasionally help him out with spelling or guessing difficult puzzles (I play the Medium level when playing alone, but plan to try the Hard level next time I play alone). The game is very much like playing the actual game, it's authenticity mainly coming from the real voices of Pat, Vanna, and Charlie, and the way Pat's Mii avatar actually walks over to your avatar and other contestants' and interacts with them when they win a round. My only complaints are that you need a really steady hand when using the Wiimote to click on the letters to fill in the answer. One wrong click, and you're done.  That's probably the main reason they give so much time for people to solve. Also, I wish there were a little more variety in the built-in contestant avatars. Overall, though, this version of WOF is about as close as you can get to playing the real thing. Oh, and one thing I noticed other reviewers didn't mention is that as you play and win rounds, you unlock accessories you can use to change your Mii's appearance in the game. There are various shirts, bottoms, dresses, shoes, logos/decals to place on your Mii's shirt, and you can change the color on the clothing and shoes, and if you're using the Wii Speak, you can also make some type of changes to the sounds your Mii makes (not having the Speak, I don't know what the voice features really are).

What impresses me most about this game is the respect it shows to its source material, the classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  More than anything, _Gatsby_ is a portrait of the 1920s, and the spirit of the decade is captured perfectly here in the music, the fashion, even some of the terminology.

Even more impressive is that the creators of the game pay homage to some of the important but more subtle elements in the novel.  Fitzgerald's use of time, for example, is alluded to in the first scene in which the player is required to find five clocks, and each hidden object sequence includes a secret word that connects thematically with the book itself.  Spoken dialogue is taken directly from the novel, and all of its important symbols (including the Eyes of T.J. Eckleburg) are intact.

In terms of the gameplay itself, there are a few sequences that break up the monotony of one simple hidden-object scene after another.  There are two typing sequences, one number puzzle, and a few other simple puzzles to solve, but there could have been more.  The player does not lose interest -- the game is too visually stunning for that -- but a few more surprises, a little more variety could have made for a more well-rounded gaming experience.

Overall, it is a game I have played several times through, and I could play it again.  Its visuals and respect to its source material make up for the lack of variety in gameplay.  I recommend it.","Can't make a game of Gatsby?  Why, of course you can!",1328572800,,,

I don't think anyone in a right mind can argue these are a good deal, unless you are winning money with them.
It is a little peace of plastic that cost about $6 per stick extender.

That being said, I subjectively say it has helped me in Battlefield 3, especially when flying.
The right stick is used for aiming in most games and extending the thumbstick means there is greater control for aiming. This is a simple physics issue.  But I'm not convinced it helps at all in the left thumb stick on PS3 or Xbox.

It takes about 45 minutes to get used to having these on. You will need the same amount of time to adjust if you have to use a different controller.

The connect to the existing thumb stick with 3 prongs.  It snaps on, but I don't know if they just as easily pop off.  My guess is you could put these on and off about 3 times before you mess up the FPS Freek or even worse, a thumb stick.

I've thought about taking off my left FPS Freek because it seems of marginal importance and taking it off would make marking enemies in BF3 by hitting the back button much easier.

I play MLB the show and could barely hit due to the left stick's deadzone.  Furthermore, the rumble function was pretty loud.  If I had the volume up loud enough I can't hear it but if not, it got annoying.  Additionally, R2's pressure sensitivity is broken.  It's a trigger so you need to be able to apply different amounts for driving games and replays (ie. NCAA football 12).

I play NCAA Football and MLB the most...this controller was bought for both games and makes each game very difficult to enjoy.  In NCAA if i'm running up field I don't have the option of changing slight direction to avoid a defender.  Because of the deadzone I go straight forward or like 70 degrees right or left.  Also, user catching is almost impossible.  Replays (already mentioned) can't be viewed in slow motion.  Kicking accuracy is impossible (have to super sim).  Also, the battery life is drastically (50%) less than my first ps3 controller.

1) The color - the xbox comes with a black controller and I thought having another color would be a good way have a ""mine"" and ""yours"".  The color is true to the pictures.  It looks like it might be slippery, but it is not. You'll be able to grip it perfectly.  The a, b, x, y letters are hard to see through the buttons, but frequent use will make that irrelevant. (I already remember which is the ""B"" button!) If you're own previous versions, the letters are in the same place. ^.^

2) The ""Play & Charge Kit"" - I love the rechargable battery. (Go green!) However, the controller must be charged by your xbox. So, your controller must be plugged into your system and the system must be on. I constantly forget to connect the controller so that it can charge when I'm using the other one. So, when company comes the controller is often dead and since they have to literally ""Play and Charger"", the controller loses the ability to be wireless for a time.  I do wish I had the ability to plug the charger into a wall socket for times like those.  At least we would not have to be right next to the system while it is charging. (The cord is not very long) You are able to instert two Double AA batteries into the non-rechargable battery case that is included, though. This way, it is still wireless, but now, the rechargable battery can not re-charge. (You are unable to recharger the battery when it is not inserted into the controller.)

One feature I love is that when the xbox is turned off, the controllers automatically turn off as well.  This feature saves me the trouble of having to remember to turn off each remote and further drain the battery. The remotes also turn themselves off after a period of inactivity whether or not your system is on. (Great when you're playing Kinect games and not using them.)

All in all, this is a great buy if you want to add some color to your controller selection and not have to pay for the ""Play and Charge Kit"" separately.

The model animations are randomly OK or horrible (notice the first scene where people keep falling, how everyone falls the same and their hands are floating off the ground).

They attempted context sensitive controls... attempted. It either over shoots, gives you the text as if you can perform an action, but you can't (for example, holding a sword prevents you from picking up items, but it says you can - lack of polish).

Overlooking all the graphics and voice issues, I gave the game a chance based on it's gameplay. The controls were impossible. Not over complex, just, again (word of the day), unpolished. Easy, fixable issues were overlooked, and are now ingrained as standard (I mention this as not to imply they will ever fix them; they will not, they are now expected).

In this game you get shot once and your done. When you shoot a gun it goes all over the place - impossible to actually hit someone. Seems like most kills are all luck. I seriously am so disappointed that I bought this game. Biggest waist of money ever. Sure you can drive vehicles and blow trees up but that still doesn't justify horrible aim when shooting. Everyone just runs around hoping to nick someone.

Save yourself the money - this game is just so utterly horribly done I seriously don't understand how they could put it out. Don't forget the ""motion sickness"" is so unbearable. When you run it literally is like watching a head-cam we all know how sickening that is.

1,False,"03 23, 2011",AFLRU6952DEFX,B004774IPU,S.,"This game has significant shortcomings which become more and more apparent with use.

Civ games have always been 'jack of all trades' empire management and war type games, but in this case, the sum of its parts reveals less than a full whole.  In short, if you are looking for a Civ game, Civ 3 or 4 would far exceed #5 in terms of 'the Civ experience.'  In terms of strategy games, there are obviously better ones out there, like the Galatic Civ Series, or Europa Universalis games, compared to 5. I'm not an expert on all games, but it seems like 5 needs at least one expansion before it can become worth playing and lives up to its name.

To start, the opponents' AI is lifeless and displays neither personality nor reason.  At least in Civ 4, religion united and divided AI Civs, and created the illusion that the AI knew what it was doing.  Here in Civ 5, the AI judges at best by relative military strength (every game does), and at worse, it just seems random.  City states are random as well - a vassal with random missions.

Granted, religion itself in Civ4 had very little depth, but at least it religion in Civ 4 provided reasons, admittedly simplistic ones, for the AI to form coalitions, rivals, and enemies.

The AI is inept in battle, and this stems largely from the 1-unit-per-tile rule, which requires a lot of thought to manage, and which the AI doesn't handle well at all or provide a challenge, since it fails to use tactics. It would be an improvement over say Civ 3's stacks of doom, which could not be decimated by artillery as easily as in Civ 4, but 1-unit-per-tile comes with many drawbacks in this game, which makes it a frustrating and annoying system here.  There are many ways to model combat strategically, for example involving supply limits per tile, but what is here doesn't work.

It isn't entirely surprising - the maps are rather small for this sort of combat tactics, and moving your own units is requires great attention and units easily bottleneck even in peacetime, causing all kinds of congestion.  The 1-UPT rule doesn't work for _this_  game, given that it forces you to more or less use combined arms (more than one unit) but units build incredibly slowly, as if they represent full armies (thousands or hundred of thousands of combatants) and not a simple cohort of say 750 archers.  It basically tries to do strategic and tactical combat, and fails at both.

Oddly, you don't need transports to move units across water - they just magically (!) morph into boats without having to build a navy !

Sadly, there isn't much to do in this game besides warfare, and the warfare and expansion isn't fun for a litany of reasons.  Wonders give boring effects in percentages and aren't really worth it.

The game starts with a limited number of civs, with several important ones missing (Spain being the biggest - what were they thinking?) and the makers want dollars for each extra one. I would hope a mod-maker will come along and just add a dozen custom civs themselves.  At this point, it isn't worth buying additional civs when the base game is largely inadequate.  Here's to hoping Civ5 can be fixed in an expansion - I doubt patches can solve the issues which have removed many layers of complexity but left the gameplay rather barren.

P.S. Yes, it has Steam DRM and requires an internet connection to activate.  If you can't activate it, you can't play it. At present it is 'rent-ware' subject to the quirks and survival of Steam, but it is possible that by the time this game becomes a bargain bin game, the makers may remove such limitations.

3,False,"09 11, 2011",A2LY9PTQMENFB1,B0047THYWC,brxbrxx,"First of all, I enjoyed playing DA2.  Just thought I should put that out there.  But I could have enjoyed it SO MUCH MORE!
Here are my issues

  *Recycling terrain over and again

  *The limited amount of animations in combat and dialogue.  Watching Hawke make the same gestures and pace around the room got old after the fourth or fifth time, and combat with him making the same repetitive moves swinging his staff about in the same rhythm also got tiresome.

  *The ""dark"" setting.  I didn't consider DAO to be particularly dark.  Looking back I suppose it was.  But the mood in DA2 is simply contrived.  Sure, it's not all black and white, but when you present a reasonable character and then make him go completely nuts (no spoilers, but if you've played, you know who I'm talking about), the issue just seems forced.  It seems towards the end of the game nobody has any sense anymore.

  *Level scaling.  Level scaling is a cancer on CRPGs.  I hate finding some nice item only to see it become obsolete next chapter.

  *Items seemingly randomly generated.  Having to sort through a few dozen belts all with similar benefits that don't really stand out much anyways is annoying.  If I want randomly created loot, I'll play Diablo.

  *The dialogue wheel.  Yay!  My character's personality is now limited to three choices!  Wooo!

  *Wave combat.  It kills strategy.  Where before, I had to set up my dudes and prepare to cast spells like death cloud in certain places or maybe have my aura guy stand right there that's all sort irrelevant if enemies are just going to jump down next to you from the roof.  If that were the case for some combats, I'd be fine with that.  I'd even like it.  But for all of them it's just annoying not knowing how many more you have to kill (like, when is this combat going to end already?) and not knowing where they're coming from (why can't I go on the roofs to find them, anyways?).

  *Bugs.  I bought the game early, and encountered some quest breaking bugs.  I assume those have been patched out.  Still disappointing.

  *Rogues are just fighters, now.  Maybe you could try making sneaking useful?

  *Setting again.  Why do I keep getting attacked by hundreds of bandits in the middle of the city?  Where is the city guard and why are there still bandits after I've killed so many?

  *The equipment for my character was pretty limited, and a lot of it looked pretty silly.  Maybe if I'd spent extra money on DLC...

  *Health.  Injuries in DAO were interesting.  A concussion  would screw your mental stats, a torn muscle your strength.  In DA2, all injuries are health percentage reductions.  Blah.  I don't remember if health healed automatically after battle in DAO, but the fact that it does really removes any fears of survival, and it makes healing spells much less appealing.

  *Classes.  I'd have liked to have been offered a little bit more choice.  I didn't want Hawke to be a blood mage or a spirit healer, you know.

All in all, Dragon Age 2 is actually a good game.  But it's the sequel to Dragon Age: Origins, and that was a fantastic game.  Therefore it is held up to a higher standard.  DA2 doesn't add anything to the series.  Instead, it takes things away.  Naturally, this makes it a worse game.
I don't understand why devs think it's a good idea to remove beloved features from a game's sequel.  If I made video games, my slogan would be ""Add and improve, don't remove!""
I honestly can't think of anything Dragon Age 2 does better than it's predecessor, or anything it has its predecessor didn't.  Even the graphics don't seem much different.  I'd have been happy with another expansion for DAO.

4,False,"03 17, 2011",A1FST8NVFWYFTZ,B0047THYWC,roboticsun,"After putting 50 hours in this game, finally be able to write a thoughtful review for this game. I can understand why so many people hate this game, but if you calm down and try to enjoy it you will find how amazing it is. I spent 45 hours on my first play through in hard difficulty, right now still on my 2nd play through in nightmare difficulty. Can't stop playing it since it was released. Here is my review:

Story:

Since most people play this game are interested in story. I will talk about this first. I read a lot of reviews saying how shallow the story is. However, I think the reason is most people are used to 'the lord of ring' formula. This game is not about slaying evil like the first game but a story through Hawke's life in Kirkwall. It seems there is no clear goal for the story, but there are lots of lore about dragon age world. The plot is simple, just about How the Ferelden refugee Hawke gains power in Kirkwall. But through Hawke's life you will find the conflicts between Qun and  Chantry (the religion conflicts between human and qunari), you will know more about Dalish's and surface dwarf's culture and of course you will learn more about the struggles between Templars and mages. The most engaging part of the game is Hawke's family and companions all have their own story, you won't feel they just suddenly pop out. Though the plot is pretty linear, you can still make lots of choices, side with different forces and influence how they will end including the companions.

Companions:

Origins did better in this part. Dragon age 2 is similar to Awakening. You can not interact with companions unless there are companion's quests. Of course there are a lot of quests from companions. Through those quests, you can push them to Friendship or Rivalry with Hawke based on your dialog choices. It's actually interesting to see how different they will treat Hawke as friend or as rivalry. And one thing I like about dragon age 2 is you actually can see how the companions are interacted with each other through cut scenes, also they will act differently as friend or as rivalry. To avoid the spoilers, I do not want to talk about companions in dragon age 2, but generally Origins' companions have more distinct personalities, of course you can see several cameos of them. Also the Warden in first game is referred a couple of times.

Combat:

Many hardcore rpg gamers may hate this combat system. I can see the reason behind that. But generally combat in dragon age 2 is better and well balanced despite the `ugly' animations. I did not play in easy and normal difficulties, because I know they are not designed for PC gamers. However, I found the hard mode is a satisfying tactical combat experience. Because the resistances of your side are low, mages and rogues are vulnerable to physical damages and their actions will be interrupted often, so you will need to pause often and relocate them to avoid damage and use warrior to taunt enemies wisely. Boss fights will take quite a while, because of their huge amount of health and continuous reinforcements, however most bosses in the main plot are not very challenging, the hard parts are all in side quests. So it won't be very difficult to finish the game in hard mode. I played in nightmare for a few hours, it really takes a long time for a single battle, because you either have to relocate party members or kite frequently to avoid friendly fire or you have to kill enemies one by one without skills or spells with area effects. And bioware is being lazy on this, they put even more health and resistances to enemies but not working on AI, so some battles are just being tedious at the end.

Environment:

This is the major flaw of this game. A lot of recycle dungeons and recycle music from Origins. I can see Bioware really rushed this game to be released (or EA forced them to rush). However, I probably will tolerate this, since this is really not the thing I care about

Summary:

Because of the revamped combat system, I can see a lot of people will lose interests in this game,
Though personally I do enjoy my first play through for 45 hours and I still have a couple of side quests I found but did not finish them. It's certainly shorter than Origins which took me 60 hours for first play through on hard mode. But this is still a great game if you really get into it. if you like party based tactical combat like dragon age origins and world of warcraft, I suggest you start with hard difficulty and most likely you will like dragon age 2. If you are looking for a game following the track of Origins, this game may not be your type. The core of this game is highly 'mass effect' ed, if you are a fan of mass effect series, you may like this too.

A traditional Bioware game has 8 story sequences, each about 4 hours in length.

1 - The hero finds himself embarking upon an epic journey to save the world.

2 - The hero enters a secret society of mystical warriors.

3 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world AB.

4 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world CD.

5 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world  EF.

6 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world GH.

7 - The hero leads his party in their final mission to position them for the ultimate war.

8 - The hero leads his party to victory against the endless enemy hoards and defeats the ultimate villain.

Dragon Age 2 includes only sequences 1, 3 & 4. The unreliable narrator, in this case, is a cheap device, made of short cut scenes, used to patch over the missing story holes.

Since having only three sequences would make the game too short, Bioware pumped up sequence 1 with an extra 16 hours of random side quests, most of which recycle the same generic dungeons over and over. This was done to reduce development costs.

The game ends immediately after sequence 4, with a 30-second endgame cutscene that basically says, please look forward to a new hero and a new world in Dragon Age 3.

So, knowing all that up front, Dragon Age 2 is still, for me, a 5-Star RPG Experience. Of the top 200 bestselling PS3 games of all time, only 6 are RPGs. I like Oblivion. I dislike Fallout 3, Fallout NV, FFXIII, and Demon's Souls. And I love Dragon Age: Origins.

Dragon Age 2, it turns out, I love even more than DA:O. The graphics, while weak, are better than the previous. The new art design fits the world perfect. The combat is faster, equally tactical, and casting spells feels 400% more powerful. And sequence 3, with the big brooding horny guys, is one of the most intensely awesome Bioware experiences I've ever played. Indeed, sequence 3 alone, allows me to forgive all of the game's flaws.

My only other regrets are... They should have brought back Morrigan 2.0 instead of Flemmeth 2.0, and given her a bigger role. They should have made the end cut scene longer, with artistic depictions of the fates of the companions and chosen love interest. They should have made the character model of Aveline a hottie instead of an ugly. And they should have allowed the freedom to have naked threesomes.

But it's like they say... 50% of a Bioware game is better than 10 Square-Enix games.

4,True,"10 5, 2012",A3SMO4R9IN85NX,B004AM5RAM,JoshJosh,"A lot of people got this mouse for World of Warcraft and frequently commented that it took some adjustment to get used to it. I do not play World of Warcraft. I bought this mouse for Guild Wars 2 and had played it less than a week when I got it. So, basically, I took to the mouse without a problem. I mapped 1-4 to my F1-F4 keys and 5+ number keys as usual. It actually makes the game a lot more fun and even after only a few weeks, playing without it felt slow and limiting. It works great for other games too - basically, it can enhance any game that uses a lot of buttons.

The mouse has both wired and wireless modes - the end of the charge cord either plugs into the mouse underneath the wheel or a cradle (which also acts as a receiver in wireless mode). A switch toggles between them. Battery life is okay - nothing compared to my Logitech M510, which I got in June and is still on the original battery (though that's not a gaming mouse). Wireless on the Naga Epic works for about 8-12 hours and charges in either the cradle or in wired mode. Thankfully, the mouse cord is plenty long for those times the battery is drained and the game session is not over - it's long enough for me to use on the couch. Although the software has an auto shut-off setting after a few minutes of activity, I have found that the battery drains if I do not set the switch to wired. At least there is a charge meter in the Razer Synapse software.

I do have issues with the software and wireless mode. I've had issues where the mouse simply stopped working without a reboot, or started going haywire without a pair. I had to reinstall the Razer Synapse drivers because it simply refused to recognize my mouse, asking that I pair a device. The Razer Synapse software in general seems questionable - I don't much see the appeal of a ""cloud-based"" driver solution, but I guess there are use cases where this would come in handy.

The build quality otherwise feels good. The mouse has a nice texture on the surface and all the buttons feel appropriately clicky. The mouse comes with a set of 3 side panels to adjust how it fits your hand so it shouldn't be hard for anyone to find a shape that they like. The mouse also lights up in various sections (around the wheel, near the palm rest, and the buttons) and the colors can be customized in the software.

Overall, I really like this mouse, and I would easily give it 5 stars were it not for the issues around battery drain, driver software, and wireless. Yes I can use wired all the time but if I wanted to do that I could have saved a lot of money by going with the regular Razer Naga.","Great design, questionable wireless and software",1349395200,,{'Style:': ' Epic'},

The challenge is to kill only the target without alerting the other NPCs. Stealth in Hitman does not mean only hiding in the shadows and going from point A to point B in a mostly linear path hiding from enemies and executing a sequence of events. It has a very open format - kudos to the makers. How you complete your objective is up to you. It involves hiding in plain sight which can mean disguises to reach close to the target, knocking out guards using anesthetic, sniping from afar but making sure no one see you, engineering accidents, planting bombs near the targets to either distract or kill. All these can be used to complete a level in multiple ways or used in conjunction on the same level. It can also be pure stealth - learn the movement patterns of the NPCs and steal around them. Just one more point, you also need to escape. So if you go in close and do not succeed in a clean kill, the guards are alerted and you may not be able to escape.

Blood money is the best of the lot in the sense that the number of ways to complete the missions are virtually unlimited. Hitman 2 is the most realistic and also the hardest but again with multiple ways to complete. Note that the aim is to get the ""Silent Assassin"" rank - the highest achievable - and that is not dependent on any particular method. You can also KO or kill anyone you like in any manner you see fit but that can affect the rankings. Also each mission can be completed in less than 15 minutes and games who want to challenge themselves do it in less than 5 minutes or even less - all with the highest ""Silent Assassin"" ranking.

Note that Hitman is not a action/shooter game - there are others that do it a lot better. It is also not a stealth game - Thief comes to mind which was pure stealth and where you lost if even one NPC saw you. Hitman is, well a game about being a Hitman - a Silent Assassin - for want of a better term. :)

I am now officially a fan of the series after playing Hitman the first time more than a decade ago and writing it off as a wannabe stealth/shooter game (it was all splinter cell and thief back then) and not giving it a second look.",Hitman is not a stealth/action game... it is however a very intelligent one...,1364774400,4,,
4,True,"11 16, 2011",A15ZT939DXGJ3G,B004DTU0W2,Leeroy Jenkins,"Anyway...I. Love. This. Controller.

I had to decide between this and the official 360 special edition controller.  Being that I'm buying this to play racing games on the PC, were I to buy MS's solution, I'd also have to buy the wireless to USB connection dongle thing.  That made my decision easy.

I'm darn glad I made this decision.

As compared to the official 360 controller, the D-pad buttons are like night and day.  The face buttons are AWESOME.  The adjustable resistance analogue sticks are...some other complementary adjective I can't think of right now.

And the soft touch finish is dreamy as well.

The D-Pad buttons are the way (I think) they should be.  Very tactile.  There is no guessing as to where a button is or if its been pressed.  The ambiguity that the official controller has is non existant in this controller.  To be fair, the special edition official controller is said to be improved as well, but I feel that with as bad as the ""stock"" controller is, MS should be shipping the new controller with all new 360s.  As far as I know, they are not.  However, this is not an editorial, it is a product review.  I digress...

The face buttons...if you've ever used a mouse, you know how these things feel.  Again, EXTREMELY tactile.  I am in love.  These buttons light up...I could do without the lights.  I think they look tacky, but its a Razer product.  What do you expect?  To be honest, the effect could be worse.  But it doesn't completely ruin the look, and it is not so bright as to be distracting in a dark room, so I do not feel that this alone is worthy of a point reduction.

The analog sticks?  Well, they are a case of six in one hand, half dozen in the other.  On one hand, they do change resistance as you turn the stick.  You are able to feel the difference, no question.  But the way in which they change is just...unnatural is the only word I can think of.  Movement directly off center is firm, and as you move outward, tension increases incrementally.  Again, this is a very tactile experience, and it works.  I just wish there was a way it could be one uniform tension all the way through the range that would be increased.  Not ""the further out you go, the more tension you have"".  This is a matter of opinion, so again, not worthy of a point reduction.

The extra shoulder buttons?  Meh.  I could take them or leave them.  They cause more issue than they are worth.  I've just mapped them to their respective bumper.  They aren't bad since I can just remap them to the bumper buttons, but for me, they don't add any functionality.  They may in the future, but for now, they are just a couple of extra and unnecessary buttons.  This one is completely up to you.

Overall, this controller is very, very good.  If you get it, I doubt you would have regrets.  I just feel that with the lights, the tension, and the shoulder buttons, for _ME_ it would get 4.5 stars.  Not quite perfect, but darn close.",Hmm.  Amazon thinks this controller is a game.

Because of how crappy MK became over all the years, so I was just thinking another MK with the same boring stiff style. Then I saw some videos and I LIKED it, then I played the demo and LOVED it, now I have the game and I'M IN LOVE with it. This is the best MK by far, for the longest I said MK3 was the best but this here outdid it all, finally they returned to 3D graphics on a 2D plane. MK now have 2-on-2 matches like Marvel vs. Capcom, Challenge Tower and Fatality Training (so no more excuses for not finishing your opponent). MK has even slim down their roster from that crazy 63 fighters in MK: Armageddon to about 30 fighters now and if you got PS3 like me you get Kratos and I can't think of anyone more suited for MK than the God of War himself and what make it even better they didn't dull down Kratos' style... They even have sequences from the GoW games for him in matches but you can only use him in versus mode. MK went back to their roots, one of my favorite things are: as you're taking and dealing damage the blood don't just squirt out onto the ground the fighters become bloody and disfigured. Now my absolute favorite thing is the super combo gauge as you take and deal damage your combo gauge fills level 1-enhanced special attack, level 2-combo breaker and level 3 the best of all X-RAY attack: the camera goes in and will show an inside view of the fighter who is being attacked while bones and organs are broken and shattered. The fatalities are all back to what they should be not that crap you got from MKvDC they brought the M-Rated worthy they introduced us to 18years ago. Now for my review: GAMEPLAY 5stars: there is four attack buttons, 2D fighting style and finally the fighters are more loose and flexible not stiff like previous MK, that's why I like this so much, GRAPHICS 5stars: this game looks great the stages are so well designed and so are the fighters and by the way this is 3D compatible which really sets the graphics off, STORY MODE 4stars: it becomes harder as the chapters progress and you get a chance to play with different fighters but no fatalities. ONLINE 5stars: take your skills online and compete against others and even watch fights as if you`re at the movies (you can even cheer and boo the fight)in King of the Hill, FIGHTERS 5stars: MK dramatically improved their roster by cutting it down. If you ever liked MK get this game, if you thought about MK get this game, if you're looking for an M-Rated fighter get this game. I wouldn't be surprised if this won Best Fighting Game...

4,False,"04 16, 2011",A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B004HVKA9O,Tempting Reviews,"I know a lot of people are just tired of Dynasty/Samurai/Gundam/Chibi/Troy Warriors games.  I mean they're just the same thing over and over again, right?  Yes.  But that's not the whole of it.  Dynasty Warriors 6 was really the opportunity to show an evolution of the game into a next gen system.  It really should have been a more fun version of Ninety-Nine Nights.  But instead, it was quite possibly the worst Dynasty Warriors game ever created.  So it's no surprise that Dynasty Warriors 7 has so few reviews.  Nevermind the fact that people are so bent on first person shooters and Madden games.

I went into part 7 with skepticism.  I figured it'd be the same thing all over again.  Turns out I was right...and I was wrong.

While the general gameplay elements - mashing buttons - are still there, and the challenge is just as low as always - harmless peons swarming around you waiting for death, the game is markedly improved over the older versions in many ways, depending on what you go in expecting.  Also, Tecmo Koei took the best elements of the Empires games, the Tactics games, and Strikeforce, mashed them up together, and threw in a bit of Dynasty Warriors 3 for good measure.  The result is quite solid.

First, the Story Mode has been improved.  Instead of playing the exact same story over and over again with every character on each kingdom, you now simply play through each story and use various characters depending on the course of the storyline.  For example, when playing Shu, you'll start out early on playing with Liu Bei, Guan Yu or Zhang Fei depending on the map, then later, Zhuge Liang and Huang Zhong, as well as others.  This lets you experience each character without multiple wasted hours of playthroughs, and exposed you to the story from different angles.  It also increases the character development over other versions by allowing you to see each perspective.  Cutscenes have been brought back as well, which were sorely missed.  It feels like an extension of what brought Dynasty Warriors 3 to the dance.  The telling of the story is excellent; it has emotion, comedy, and linearity without the silliness of Dynasty Warriors 5.  When characters die as in the real story, you actually experience the emotion of it.  They don't just disappear, there's an actual cutscene dedicated to most of these deaths.

Second, it's clear to see Tecmo's influence on this game.  Instead of a pause screen showing a rockslide, now the camera simply pans over and shows it happening, in line.  If you've ever played the next generation Ninja Gaiden games, the effect is quite similar.  The only time you'll see a pause screen is when it's loading the next scenario - and it still tells the story during this time, which keeps you in the game unlike older games.  Also, there are mid-battle areas where you can talk to other generals, upgrade weapons, and such; when you're ready, you talk to one of the generals, and it again simply pans over and the action begins, instead of a separate load screen.  The game feels quite fluid almost all of the time, and in certain battles, this transition even extends to multiple generals in a single battle.  So you'll use Cao Cao for part of the battle, then transition to Xiahou Yuan, for example.

Third, the characters are no longer as one-dimensional as they had been before.  Now, characters can equip basically any weapon they want as long as it's available for their gender.  Some weapons they're better at than others, and you'll want to get used to the idea of equipping the odd weapon every now and then, because it's the only way you can unlock Seals, which are powerups for your characters.  It's just weird seeing Xiahou Dun wielding Sun Shang Xiang's hoops, but whatever gets the job done.  Also, don't worry about musous - the character will always use the same UBER powerful musou no matter what they've got equipped.  Speaking of musou, they're seriously killer...to the point even average characters (Xu Zhu) are dominant in this game.

Combat is constantly fast and furious and the enemies numerous.  Getting 500 kills minimum per battle will become a no-brainer, sometimes you'll be up in the 1200's just by the nature of the scenario.  There are times when your only objective is to just keep on fighting endless swarms of enemies coming at you until they're cleared out, or to escort someone through a castle and to safety (encountering endless swarms of enemies coming at you until you're cleared out).  The breaks in between scenarios is a welcome respite to this fast-and-furious gameplay, but don't misunderstand: it's still button mashing.

Skip over to Conquest Mode, and you'll be able to dominate a bunch of scenarios using whatever officer you want.  Certain officers don't get unlocked until you finish the Story Mode, so you'll probably want to do that first, but Conquest Mode is where you can basically do whatever you want.  You'll start off in a town, where you can buy weapons and items (ala Strikeforce), then you proceed out to battle to do scenario-based battling.  Here is also where you can build up your warrior to use in versus or other modes.

Graphically the game is not pushing the envelope of the PS3 or 360.  But it's definitely superior to the PS2 versions of the game by a long shot.  Pop-in still occurs (which is mind boggling), though there is no ""fog of war"".  The Pop-in is the only knock down on the game, quite frankly.

I've got to say, this game is quite entertaining.  It's just unfortunate that Tecmo Koei is way too late with it.  This is what Dynasty Warriors 6 should have been.  Now, a lot of people will miss out on what is probably the best Dynasty Warriors game of the series.",Game: Average.  Experience: Amazing.,1302912000,16,{'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'},

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"To new or die-hard fans of Bust-a-Move, this 3DS cartridge packs a good amount of arcade-puzzle entertainment to justify the price of admission. For other Bust-a-Move fans, this is the Puzzle Bobble equivalent to New Super Mario Bros. 2: It's your average bubble-busting puzzler, except made easier and with nothing new added onto it. There are only two modes (Puzzle and Challenge) in the game, and only one of which with a decent length.

Puzzle Mode is spread out in eight worlds, with ten rounds in each. Each round is a hurdle of multicolored bubbles that you must pop to move on. Some of you are familiar with this, right? Well, you're partially in luck: Nothing's different about it! However, by partially, I mean that the Guideline is ALWAYS ON. You know - The long line coming from the cannon so you know precisely where to place your new bubbles? You can't turn that off. It will always be there for you to pinpoint where to make your bubble chains. This is either a sign of relief or a miserable dumbing down of difficulty.

Challenge Mode doesn't fare too well, either. There's only three time limits (Well, the last one being ""Nonstop!""), and you just keep popping the bubble chains until the time runs out or if you lose.

You just have to lay it down within the little area of the grip.  I saw someone say they didn't know what the stand was for.  You need only think of the future of the 3DS to see what this could be used for.  Besides holding a memory card within it, imagine when net flix becomes avalible.  You can be doing something on the computer, or home work or whatever, then, you can start net flix and watch or listen to a TV show or movie while you doing something else!  This makes me really excited about the future of the 3DS.  The grips feel god in my hands.  I have big hands and the grip feels good while I'm holding it.

The only couple problems I have with the grips is this.  While they do feel good in my hands, seems as if they would have been better if they had made the main hand grips a little fatter.  I understand everyone has different sized and shapped hands, so maybe they could sell a small, medium and large size grip.  I mean, it does feel nice, I just think it being a bit bigger would feel even better.  Another thing that bothered me was the fact that now, the system is no longer evenly weighted.  When you sit it in the grip and hold it, you will probably keep getting the feeling that the system is going to flip over out of your hand.  If they put a little weight in the bottom of the grips, this problem could be fixed very easly.  All and all though I am happy with the grips.

I own (and put TONS of hours) into all of them, from the very first to this one... I'm sorry, let me be honest, I didn't get into four much and I traded silent line back in. They were just, ""too much of the same"". The series was in need of a fresh take, and AC5 is that fresh take, however, it's not a ""brand new game"". The AC's are built in the same modular fashion, the weapons are still handled in about the same fashion (I hear the shoulder rack was introduced in silent line, I don't remember that game very well).

In this iteration, the AC's are smaller, faster, and far more maneuverable, which is great, because the story missions are just as asinine and frustrating as ever, but at least now you can handle them with flair. As for the meat of the game being multiplayer, it's pretty well done IMO. The operator is tasked with scanning the battlefield in real time and relaying the intel to the active players on the ground, territory acquisition and defense is interesting and keeps the game from getting stale...

5,True,"12 14, 2013",A2G44NES0MQOAC,B004PFS9OK,ycnan,"After playing games like COD, Battlefield and Killzone or Halo, sometimes, I tend to lean more towards tactical warfare that has a much more realistic approach. The problem with consoles is that these games are few and far in between. While there are good tactical games like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, America's Army, and previous Operation Flashpoint games, they tend to be games that try to rely on way too much realism whilst butchering the game play aspect.
Thankfully, this game does the exact opposite by providing a tactical but semi-casual experience. Here's my review-

Graphics-

Being that I played the previously released OF- Dragon Rising game, I immediately noticed the slight downgrade in graphics.
The graphics aren't bad by any means but there are some instances of bland textures, and the background is somewhat static.
Still, the most impressive feat of this game would be how big the maps are granting you full freedom to explore them. Again, the maps are huge and the scale is very impressive.
Other things I liked about the graphics would be the destruction detail. For example, shooting an RPG at a building will not only show the impact of the other side of the building being blown out, but there's also a HUGE hole left behind.
When your character gets hit, you actually get to see blood on his gear, on his lenses and all over his hand and medkits; also his guns as well when action gets up close and personal.
I also liked the environmental touches such as sun glare, sand making everything look dusty looking amongst other touches. The characters in the game look cool looking with modern tactical gear, masks, bandannas draped across their mouths, though sadly, sometimes the lipsyncing can be downright awful.

The game also has lots of blood and gore.
For example, if you toss a grenade at an enemy, expect to see realistic gore such as legs and body parts flying or sometimes the whole body will explode leaving a pool of blood behind. Normally, you'll see lots of blood when successfully getting headshots, while other times, shooting an enemy in the belly then walking up to the body will result in seeing exactly where you shot him.
The backgrounds is reminiscent of modern warfare with lots of sand, mountains, some vegetation, village, deserted vehicles, and clear skies for the most part with lots of dust and sun glare. In a nutshell, it looks realistic.

Score- 9/10

Sound-

All I've heard about this game before actually getting it would be SGT. KNOX and how much he curses. But when you're actually playing the game, SGT. Knox has some of the best dialogue in a war game; period.
I will however say that his ""penis"" insults are excessive; and his cursing is a bit heavy but commendable.
Expect to hear the F-bomb, S-word, MF-word, and penis jokes that I found very funny.
The guns sound really good; especially RPG's, Sniper Rifles or Grenade Launchers. There's also the sound of airstrikes, mortar attacks and such to subtle touches such as the enemy's dialogue.
For example, I critically wounded an enemy and could hear him groaning in pain as he was dying from a distance. Stuff like this is rarely done in war games.
The one thing I absolutely hated about the game's sound would be when Alpha, Bravo or Charlie squad will keep repeating phrases such as ""taking fire"", or calling out a possible position of the enemy over and over. It actually got quite annoying at times.
The game does feature some good music as well. Songs are licensed songs however.

Score- 9.2/10

Gameplay/game modes-

One of my biggest worries about this game would be ""if I could actually see the enemies"" being that Dragon Rising had some missions that I could barely see where enemy fire was coming from. With Red River, it's a bit easier to see enemies and at times, there is close quarters combat as well.
Still, the game retains it's tactical combat engine whilst introducing them in a slightly casual way. Think Battlefield, a small amount of Call of Duty but still Operation Flashpoint.
This experience is limited to normal difficulty, but once the difficulty is ramped up, there's less HUD and enemies are much harder and will try flanking you a lot more. In fact, there is an option to remove the HUD altogether giving you a much ore realistic experience.

Health regeneration is a tad on the weird side being that you have a medkit that will heal nearly anything excluding a well placed shot to the head. One you're shot in the head; it's game over.
However, if you're shot in the body, you'll bleed out unless you have a med kit. If you're critically wounded, you'll have to call a medic over to heal you which gives this game a ""down but not out"" feature.

The story is minimal and boils down to your squad being put in a place called Tajikistan with missions ranging from clearing roads for your convoy to taking control of dams or just scouting for enemies.

Although the story is weak, the gameplay is superb. Things happen in this game that doesn't normally happen in console shooters such as escorting your company of men to a village and letting an IED expert diffuse a bomb attached to a car, tactically deploying mortar strikes and airstrikes, riding vehicles etc.

One thing I liked about the game much like I like about ARMA, DRAGON Rising and the short list of tactical shooters is the fact that you'll have to walk, run or hike to an objective or hitch a ride in a humvee. I found this to be better instead of peppering a game with nonstop action.
The other thing I liked was the fact that you're not given extra ammo and once you've used all the rounds of your gun, you'll have to find a gun left by a dead enemy or squadmate. Before any mission in the campaign mode, you're given the option of choosing what class soldier you want to use. (Rifleman, Auto rifleman, Grenadier, Scout etc)

The campaign itself has about 12 or so missions that take time to get past. On the easiest setting a mission can be beaten in 20 or so minutes but on higher difficulties, some can really eat away at the clock.
After the campaign or even before the campaign, there's another mode called FTE or Fireteam engagements which are customizable missions of your choosing. You can choose to defend, escort, team deathmatch style games or just hop right into action.

I wish I were able to write a better review about this game, but I feel that it's really underrated and one of the best shooters I've played on the 360. (and keep in mind that I literally almost own every FPS for 360 from COD to Battlefield to Bad Company to the worst games like Soldier of Fortune Payback, Conflict Denied ops etc)

Well, yes and no.

Let me start by saying that I am absolutley loving Super Soldier! When it comes to combat the developers have done a fantastic job, anyone that has played Arkham Asylum will feel right at home. Cap controls great, combat is fast and brutal, it uses the exact same counter attacking that was found in AA as well as the slow motion zoom in for that final bone breaking punch or kick. Cap of course does not have all of Batman's gadgets he does have his trusty shield which can be thrown, block enemy bullets right back at them and used to melee the enemy into submisson. It's so satisfing to be surounded by 10 enemies and to effortlessly dispatch them without a scratch on you. Boss fights have been a lot of fun, i'm really enjoying the story which is all contained within one giant compound and the voice acting is solid with Chris Evans and several other actors from the film providing their voices.

Now Super Soldier is a movie tie in which means a shorter development time because they have to have it out in time for the film which is a shame because with a little more time and polish Captain America could have been a truly great game rather than just a really solid one. Obviously it is a little rough around the edges graphics wise. Cap himself looks really good and is really well animated but environments don't fare quite so well, however I don't have as much of a problem with this as others, you actually visit several distinct locations throughout the game, large open courtyards, a prison, hedge maze, Barron Zemo's mansion, underground labs, a sewer system for accessing every area of the game, ect. it isn't just the same looking place over and over again the problem is that they just lack detail. Platforming can be a pain, its pretty much automated by just taping the A button at the right time Cap will fly through the platforming and gain large amounts of focus for pulling off special moves however the problem is that the timing can be really hard to get down, there is no penalty for messing up your timing though, you can't fail, Cap just traverses the invironment a little slower.

With all that said Captain America: Super Soldier is still awesome! There are tons of collectibles to collect my favorite being Zemo's diary entries, lots of off the beaten paths to explore in order to complete side objectives like taking out AA guns and even some challenge rooms to complete. So if you are a Cap fan or an Arkham Asylum fan then Captain America: Super Soldier should make you very happy.",Captain America: Arkham Asylum,1311206400,40,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

Overall, the mechanics and gameplay were well-executed at the expense of the story and mission structure.

Positives: The grappling hook mechanics are far more useful, and this time, you can grab on to pretty much anything close by.  Combined with other stunts like parachuting, tethering, and hijacking, this makes the action sequences a lot more fun.  Unlike San Esperito, the country of Panau feels like a much more dangerous environment, and the excessive military presence won't make the game feel like a cakewalk.  The game finally incorporates regenerating health and upgradable equipment to help make it more approchable.  Just Cause 2 takes a more serious atmosphere this time, so you feel that you are actually on a mission instead of fooling around in a sandbox.  In the first game, you could easily charge through the main story missions, and there was very little incentive to do anything else.  But in this game, you have to earn the ability to progress the main story by doing odd jobs for factions and destroying Panau government property.  This makes the action-filled main story missions feel more rewarding.  The environment is more diverse (although not realistic) and gives a refreshing change of scenery once in a while.  It would have been nice to see more unique locations like the Mile-High Club.

Negatives: Where this game really falls short, like its predecessor, is the story delivery and mission variety.  Most faction missions are very dull, short, and repetitive.  There was a lot of wasted potential for the missions in Panau City.  The game's pace can slow down at times because many faction missions have very little relevance to the main story.  The strategy for overthrowing the dictator in this game is generally accomplished by generating ""chaos"" (through missions and destruction), which is a measure that the game uses to unlock more missions.  This is fine, but you never get the opportunity to actually take over villages or cities like in the first game.  One technical detail that affected gameplay was the unusually high rate at which enemies spawn, which sometimes led to very frustrating situations. The game's story and its anticlimactic ending is unremarkable and stale.  And lastly, the voice acting is atrocious.  Particularly, Tom's character is now extremely exaggerated as the stereotypical All-American who loves succulent pig.

The franchise still has a lot of work to do with AI, story-telling, and exposition.

The Wii was amazing when it first came out, with its motion-sensing capabilities, and over the years it has built up an impressive number of games which use those capabilities very well. In comparison, the XBox 360 and PS3 have had a shorter time to get those types of games developed.

The Wii also taps into a vast number of kids' games that are simply not available on any other platform. Mario and Luigi, Yoshi, toadstools and Kart races, it almost seems a rite of passage for kids to play these harmless, skill-learning games.

The Wii also offers gaming for adults, but this is generally not where their strength is. The PS3 and XBox 360 are much better known for their serious, mature content. Also, their online gaming systems and high quality video are geared towards that level of gameplay. They expect you to be able to go online and to handle yourself in that online world.

The Wii on the other hand tends to shelter you from those areas. Any online interaction is strictly controlled. Options tend to be simplified. The Wii is often used as a ""starter"" system for non-gamers so they can enjoy the exercise games, the sports games, and the casual fun games. The tutorials are generally quite extensive and step you through every stage.

The Wii has never attempted to compete in terms of high quality graphics or intense online experience. That's fine - they also charge less than half than their competitors do! They are aimed squarely at the gentle arcade market, the people who want to play tennis and bowling, who want to dance around to music, and who want to race in go-carts with their friends. They do that job perfectly.

If you're going to get a Wii, accept that the graphics aren't stellar. I'd generally call them ""cute"". Accept that the online experience isn't as robust as the other systems. But with that said, if you're looking for an inexpensive gaming option that is gentle on newbies, I definitely recommend the Wii!",Perfect for its Target Audience,1311897600,14,{'Color:': ' Black'},

Individual reviews are very mixed.  My opinion is that it's awesome and what weaknesses there are (features that I'm not crazy about) aren't enough to spoil my love of this game.
Some of the issues people have can just be ignored by not using things or altering what you do in the game to counter-balance it.

There are 2 aspects to this game for newbies to AC - on the one hand it's the end of a trilogy and since AC is story intensive, it's important to get the backstory to understand what's going on, so I'd recommend picking up the previous 2 games if interested.

At the same time, the Missions and gameplay are not as difficult as previous versions making it a nice intro to new AC gamers - less of a learning curve.

NEW ADDITIONS:
The HOOKBLADE for faster climbing, hook and run maneuvers and zooming down ziplines (fun but there are limited ziplines to use & I found myself unable to use some of them during gameplay due to being at the wrong end of them),

BOMBS are alot of fun and offer new applications for strategy during missions.  They seem a little intimidating at first, but there are 4 side missions with a Bomb expert to get familiar with them and a mission tutorial on how to make them.  It's not hard.

RECRUITING SYSTEM/MASTER ASSASSINS/DENS
This was a great revamp of the Assassin Recruit system. You now have several Assassin Dens and appoint a Master Assassin over each one.
You also get 2  separate missions with each one  which are really good.

Also, Leveling up the Recruits is now turned into a relevant game on its own, so it isn't just random mission to gain them XP.  It makes it more enjoyable.

STALKERS were a nice addition.  They randomly surprise you from behind and try to kill and steal from you.

Yes, Ezio is 51 yrs old in this chapter but he isn't slowed down any, he almost moves faster than previous games thanks to the Hookblade addition.

What I liked most in this game were the excellent missions.  They were less restrictive (better 'sync' objectives & less cumbersome) and they weren't long and tedious. Any longer missions were split into 2 parts.
However, there are a couple very difficult challenges, so it's not a complete cakewalk either.
Alot does depend on your skill level.

Some CONS:

The story is good but could have beem amped up to be more exciting, dramatic and intense even though there are some exciting parts in the later missions.

There are less main and side missions in ACR than previous games so it is shorter than others.

The majority of players didn't favor a new feature,  DEN DEFENSE - a mini game where Templars try to take back your Den and you organize Assassins to defeat them.
It's difficult, confusing and there's a learning curve to it.

However at the same time, they've made it somewhat avoidable so you can optionally work to keep from having to play it.

Level your Master Assassins up to Lvl. 15 which will ""lock"" the den so that Templars can't contest it.

Or keep your  ""notoriety"" (now called Templar Awareness) low by taking out Officials that appear when it raises and/or bribing nearby Heralds.
High Awareness causes the den attacks.

The last Con to add is that there were bugs and glitches for some people and 1 Patch was just released to address that.  I had no problems with my game.

Some missions were cinematic and had an ""Indiana Jones"" feel to them with high action.  That was fun.
Some humor and romance sprinkled in with a now more mature Ezio which was done very well and was refreshing.

It made for a very nice, solid, enjoyable game where I didn't end up wanting to whip my controller into the tv screen.
Soundtrack is great (grows on you as you play), some great Characters, Graphics are well done (though less vibrant in color than ACB) and the City was interesting (there is also Cappadocia which you travel to for some new scenery).

Overall it's a very good game that I will replay often just for the fun of the missions.",Another Great Addition to the  AC series,1323820800,21,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

That said, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised that I liked MW3 as much as I did. It's a beautiful looking game, first-class graphics and inventive scenarios. It's a pity one is rushed through the missions so quickly, you hardly get to take in the scenery. And it's gorgeous, from underwater scenes to dizzying aerial acrobatics, it's a wild ride. But ultimately a huge amount of artistic effort thrown away on a terribly dumbed-down game. I found myself wishing for the old COD styles of years ago that just gave you an objective, a gun or two, a compass and good luck, mate, instead of this fool-proof ""Follow"" stuff. If you fall behind to lollygag your comrades will thoughtfully wait for you to catch up and aside from a scripted death or two, nobody on the good guy side but you ever gets killed. And you have to really be trying to get killed in this easy peasy series of 16 missions. Whatever happened to trying to figure anything out? It's too much mash, spray and pray. Sigh. Such a waste.
If you're looking for any sort of combat realism or strategic thinking don't come here, but aside from that it's reasonably fun. Oh yeah, and Captain Price is still here. I like that they've kept him around ever since COD 1 (and that goes back a ways, kids. I'd be willing to bet that the vast majority of COD players these days have never sat down to the arguable granddaddy of video war games.) So -- wonderful effort with the graphics, good voice acting, decent villains, but too dumbed down.
The game is quite generous with automatic saves which is nice. Another thing I'd like to mention is that the COD franchise games load and run more reliably in general than a lot of other games I've played. Assuming you have a reasonably decent gaming rig, I've found the COD titles to be less buggy and lag-free. Much appreciated.
The Special Ops games are a different kettle of fish that I highly recommend -- lots of fast action, you're all on your own and must fight your way through increasingly difficult waves of opponents. Nice map areas, lot of places to run & gun. Worth buying on sale.

Campaign 4/5- Was nice to see the story come to an end, kinda a mixed bag, alot felt been/here done that, while there did seem to be just enough interesting things throughout the story to keep it interesting.  This is very short lived however, as eas can be beat in 4 hours, and youd be lucky to squeeze 10 hours out of a veteran play through(took me 8 taking my time).

Spec ops-5/5 Has the missions just like MW2 had, I personally enjoy these quite a bit.  If you didn't like these on MW2 though, you're not going to like them here either.  There are only about half as many of these as on MW2, but they added a survival mode which i found quite addicting, and where ive got 80% of my playing time invested.  Not having the ability to play with 4 people here is really frustrating.

I have never played a Pikmin game before this one, and I can't say I had ever heard of it prior to my playing it.  That being said, this game is absolutely wonderful.

First things first, I need to start by saying how gorgeous this game looks.  I am playing on a 55"" OLED TV, so that automatically makes it look better, but the graphics on this game are among the prettiest I have seen on any game ever.  There are times in the game when you're climbing up a tree branch, or going through a tunnel, and I just have to stop and look in awe at the graphics. I honestly cannot believe that I am playing a game that looks this nice. It is so gorgeous, and for that reason alone it's worth your time.  The gameplay is a whole different story.

I have played all of the Warcraft games and numerous other Real Time Strategy games.  Most of those games are pretty simple - you set some guys to get gold and others to cut down trees, then you hunt with another pack of guys.  In Pikmin 3, you control up to 3 different ""heroes"" who can all have armies of Pikmin doing their bidding. Within these 3 groups, you can set some to harvest juice that makes all Pikmin faster/stronger, you can set others to build a bridge, and you can control others yet to fight and proceed across the map.  I took my time playing this game (my first time through) but the game really steps up the multi-tasking as it progresses.

Boss fights are incredibly challenging, and they made me sacrifice many Pikmin per boss as I learned their weaknesses.  This isn't too much of a problem, however, as you can go across the map and kill other small critters to propagate more Pikmin rather easily.

In the end, this game can be a leisurely game where you spend lots of time harvesting food and supplies, or you can plow through it as fast as you can to beat it in a matter of hours.  In either case, it's incredibly challenging and exceedingly fun.  Each time you lose Pikmin, you feel a little bit sad.  But only for a moment, because you then go kill a beetle or something and replace those you lost.

I couldn't recommend this game more.  It's gorgeous. The gameplay is stimulating and challenging. It has lots of rewards and just enough setbacks to make you want to keep playing.

4,True,"11 8, 2013",A1213149B6BJMA,B0050SVNSU,iamvishnu,"Pokmon Black and White 2 (henceforth referred to as BW2) are the sequel installments into the fifth generation of Pokmon. They are direct sequels to Pokmon Black and Pokmon White, respectively. This is unique for the franchise, as usually core Pokmon games start off with two separate versions, then release a third version that blends the original two games in the series, while adding a bunch of new features. Everyone thought thats what was going to happens, especially since the mascot legendary, Kyurem was distinctly gray-colored. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from BW2. I knew they would be sequel games, but I wasn't sure just how unique of an experience these games would be. I thought they would be near identical to Black and White, but I was pleasantly surprised. BW2 introduce a whole host of new features that expand greatly on the Pokmon experience and make the games a worthwhile play.

Story
[Warning: Black/White spoilers!]
BW2 takes place a short while after the events of Black and White. Its worth noting that if you originally played Black, you should play Black 2, and if you played White, you should play White 2. This keeps things consistent with important story elements that carry over from the first games. Team Plasma has largely been disbanded, and Ghetsis and the other leaders have gone into hiding. Plasmas King N has also vanished, and boy will they not let you forget it. You play as a young trainer who has just moved to a new town in the Unova region, and you are to receive your first Pokmon from Professor Junipers assistant, Bianca. As you progress through the story, collecting badges, evolving Pokmon, etc., you soon learn that Team Plasma is not entirely gone. A rogue faction of Plasma members have surfaced to revive the organization. These Plasma members dress in black, and resort to drastic measures to accomplish their goals. Along the way, youll join forces with Hugh, a headstrong boy who will stop at nothing to rescue the Purloin that Team Plasma stole from his sister. Hughs character is interesting, but I found that he developed very little, and really just showed up late to every encounter, got mad at Team Plasma, then fought some guys, before ultimately making you do all the hard work.
Speaking of underdeveloped characters, its time we talked about N. In Black and White, an enigmatic boy named N revealed himself to be the King of Team Plasma (even though thats not how monarchy works). It was also revealed that he had the ability to talk to Pokmon, and used his gift to understand the relationship between Pokmon and their trainers. At the end of Black and White, he stands up to his adopted father, Ghetsis, the real leader behind Plasma. However, that was the only real bit of character development for N in the entire game. All the other encounters, he just shows up, battles you with underwhelmingly weak Pokmon, says a few lines about wanting to understand Pokmon, then leaves. The games expect you to have a huge crush on N, but I found him rather hard to care about.
Now, in BW2, N has disappeared, and somehow every character with a speaking part has separation anxiety over him. Pretty much the entire story, other than the parts where you actually fight Team Plasma, is former Plasma members saying things like Where has Lord N gone?, When will Lord N return?, etc. Many players seem to like N for whatever reason, but I found him wholly uninteresting and BW2s obsession with him made the story a hassle to play through.
Not only that, but if you use the games Unova Link feature, the characters will talk about your Black/White character at certain points. I honestly feel sorry for the protagonists in BW2. Nobody even seems to notice they're there. The NPCs are all too busy pining away over N and singing praises about your BW character.
Whats good about BW2s story is that it follows a largely different path than BW. There are 5 new towns added, and the badges are almost all different. Its nice that they put a lot of effort into creating a new experience for a sequel game.

Gameplay
However, Pokmon games have never been super story-heavy. What really matters are the gameplay elements, and BW2 really deliver. For those of you unfamiliar with the Pokmon games, the gameplay revolves around you capturing monsters and training them to battle. The leveling and battle systems follow an old-school turn-based RPG format, however each Pokmon species is different, and many behind-the-scenes mechanics make even individual Pokmon different from others of the same species. Each Pokmon has its own type or types, which give it an advantage or disadvantage over other types, as well as a huge pool of attacks it can learn. The core mechanics are pretty deep, but like any core Pokmon game, it eases you into it. You quickly learn the ins and outs of battling.
Pokmon veterans will appreciate the blend of new and familiar. In BW you were only able to catch 5th-generation Pokmon, i.e. Pokmon that were introduced in Black and White. However in BW2 there are plenty of older Pokmon to collect right at the beginning of the game. For instance, you can catch familiar faces such as Mareep, Sunkern, Riolu, Growlithe, Magnemite, and Koffing very early on, as well as 5th-gens, making for lots of new team configurations. Most older Pokmon have their stats and movepools revamped, so they become not just viable choices, but invaluable partners.
One of the best things about BW2 is all the extra features they added. BW were notably devoid of post-game content, but BW2 fix that problem entirely. The first new feature they bring is the Habitat List, a feature of the Pokdex that allows you to sort your seen and captured Pokmon by the areas in which they appear. It also shows you when youve seen or captured all the Pokmon in an area, making Dex completion a snap (and fun for once! Imagine that!). The next innovative feature is the Join Avenue. Basically, its a shopping center near Nimbasa City, and for whatever reason, the owner puts you in charge of managing it. You can recruit game-generated players to open up shops on your avenue, or you can also recruit players you have passed by or interacted with via Wi-Fi. Each shop brings something different, from selling rare items, to selling stat-boosting training sessions, and more. Plus, every day you get more people in your avenue, whom you can direct to the shop you think they would like best, increasing your avenues rating and even upgrading it. It was always fun to come back and check on the avenue, and rewarding to come back every day to get the upgrades.
BW2 also introduce new battle arenas, on top of bringing the Battle Subway back from BW. The first is the Pokmon World Tournament, or PWT. In the PWT, you can enter tournaments against past gym leaders, championship winners, and more. It was loads of fun going up against old gym leaders, especially the Hoenn ones. The second new battle area is the Unova Challenge, which takes a different form depending on the game. For instance, in Black 2, you get the Black Tower, located in the version-exclusive Black City. In this tower, you had to hunt through many rooms to find the boss trainer for each floor so that you could advance to the next. What was so great about this was you got EXP and money from these battles, so it was great for level and money grinding. The last new feature was called PokStar Studios. It was an interesting feature where you could make movies by acting out battles in certain ways. I didn't get into it much, but it definitely seemed interesting. I wish I had given it more of my time.
A more passive feature are the new Medals. These are essentially achievements, and you get them for things like Catch 100 Pokmon or Win 200 battles, but could be for very specific things, like Save the game 50 times. There were loads of these medals to collect, and it was satisfying to go into the Pokmon Center and see the Medal Guy there, waiting to congratulate me on a new accomplishment.
The final new feature, and probably the one with the most potential, is the Key System. Basically, you can alter settings such as the games difficulty, whether you get Black City or White Forest, and more from the start menu. Every new key you get lets you unlock a new configuration option. Keys are specific to each game, however. For instance, you can only get the key for Challenge Mode in Black 2. White 2 gives you the Easy Mode key. What was great about this was that the keys were not specific to your play file, meaning if you started a new game, you would keep all your keys. If there were keys you didn't need, you could send them to your friends for them to use. This allowed players to unlock areas they would normally not be able to access. My problem with this system, however, was it didn't allow you to change the difficulty of the game from the start. You had to complete the Elite Four to get the difficulty-changing key, and by then it didn't make any difference, so I feel like the games were screwing over players who actually wanted to change the difficulty, but didn't want to start entirely over. There were also many more features that were added that I simply don't have time to go into. Youll have to discover them all for yourself.
All the new features kept the games fresh, and I rarely felt like I had run out of things to do. Even in the post-game, I didn't feel like I was simply grinding for levels. Plus, all the activities from BW return, such as the Battle Subway, Pokmon Musicals, Nimbasa Stadiums, etc.
When it comes to content, BW2 are king. I almost want to say that there has never been this much to do in a core Pokmon game, and I love it.

Presentation
Pretty much everything about the presentation is recycled from BW, which is to be expected. However, the presentation is really good. The graphics are really impressive for the DS, and even look good blown up on a 3DS screen. The Pokmon all had full animations, and were very detailed. However, the sprites of your own Pokmon while in-battle were sized-up, and did not appear to be at the correct resolution. This made the sprites look pixelated and out of focus, while the enemy sprites looked correct. Its odd that your own Pokmon sprites would be at the wrong resolution, since they're right in your face. Still, I enjoyed the graphics for the most part, and it really felt like the game came alive, and I felt close to my Pokmon for the first time in a very long time.

TL;DR
Pokmon Black and White 2 may be sequel games, and their story may not be worth much, but they bring loads of fun gameplay elements to the table, and will keep you playing for a long time after you complete them. The mix of old and new creates something both nostalgic and fresh at the same time, giving everyone something to love. Definitely check out BW2, even if you haven't played Black or White before (although you may be a bit lost as to the story and locations).

Pros:
- Great blend of old and new.
- Loads of great gameplay mechanics.
- Feels like a new experience while still being a sequel.

Cons:
- The story is not very interesting.
- Lots of rehashed content.
- Difficulty options are not available until the end of the game.

There is underground and water sequences, as well. Great to see Sully in the second half, though he's not there for the main action.

The game play was fine. I enjoyed the option to aim rifles by tilting the Vita rather than always relying on the stick. I also thought the swipe-to-climb options made such sections less tedious (though in a few spots, the touch did not seem to work; I had to use the X button).

5,True,"02 16, 2014",A7356DZOBFOJQ,B0050SWYTC,E Rice,"I picked this up on Black Friday for half the normal retail price and you to be honest with you it's worth the full MSRP.  This game is surprisingly good.  I say that as I play FPS competitively so I was reluctant to pick up this game because honestly the killzone trilogy on PS3 was not my type of thing.  I hated the ""weighted"" controls and ditched those games quickly.  However the controls on this game are actually very good and not ""weighted"" at all (think KZ shadowfall on PS4).  At first I had a hard time getting used to it b/c the Vita's analog sticks are small and they don't click in nor to they have the same range of movement as the ones on the DUALSHOCK, however after some time I really got used to them.  Here is an example of how the devs made use of the Vita's limited buttons compared to DUALSHOCK. To sprint you tap circle and you character runs automatically while you just guide him in the traditional way you would on a FPS.  Want to stop sprinting, simply press circle again and you character will stop.  This may seem crazy but trust me it's actually an extremely natural control scheme on the vita.  Also you switch weapons by pressing the switch weapon button on the touchscreen as opposed to using the face buttons.  This is actually better b/c the switch weapon button is in the lower right hand corner of the screen and it's actually easier (faster) to move your thumb from the analog to the bottom touch screen as to reaching up to the touch one of the face buttons.  You use the touchscreen to melee and it's pretty cool actually.  When you get close to an enemy a prompt to melee will flash and you tap the touchscreen to begin the melee in or you can simply press triangle.  Once you begin the melee animation, you are presented with a of quick time event (a keen to God of War) whereas you are presented with a random direction to swipe on the touchscreen to perform the melee.  To counter this, depending on if the melee is an assassination (behind the back) or melee from the front the enemy player will have an opportunity to counter the melee by swiping in a random direction.  It's actually well done.  I could go on and on about the controls but they are very well executed by the devs.

Also the weapon selection is extremely robust.  There is a primary and secondary weapon for everybody in this game.  Oh yeah the graphics are AMAZING! Seriously, your mouth will drop when you see the graphics. The MP is very, very good.  In fact I have yet to play the campaign, I've been to busy playing MP.  My friends and I all have this game and KZ Shadowfall for PS4 and we all agree that the Mercenary's MP is in some ways is much better than Shadowfall's MP.  I'm really glad I took a chance on this game I'm in no way disappointed and you won't be either if you purchase this game b/c for once the internet was right, this game rocks.

P.S. if you are obsessed with trophies like I am, then be warned this game takes after the other KZ games with a long trophy list that will take some time to earn.

1. The game disc.
2. A steelbook case, which contains the game disc and two promotional codes: one for the bonus digital content of God of War: Ascension and the other is the character dlc for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
3. A Kratos statue.

The steelbook case has a smooth and shiny cover and two character artworks inside the case.
The statue is cheap. A top quality statue will cost much much more. Considering you pay 20 more dollars on this collector's edition for the statue and many other features, the quality of it is totally acceptable. It takes a little bit of effort to assemble the statue since the design of the base is pretty bad. The statue holds well and the arms won't come loose. It doesn't have a bad smell. If you place it on your shelf and look at it from a distance I would say it is a pretty decent piece.
But if you have a very high demand of the statue and expect it to be great, you shouldn't get this collector's edition.

What the digital content includes:

1. Online pass activation code
Which enables you to play online.
2. Official game soundtrack
A total of 27 tracks, 128MB. And you don't have to launch the game to enjoy the music since it will be downloaded on your PS3 system and you can copy the file to your PC.
3. 48 hours MP XP booster
Boosts your multiplayer experience points at a faster rate than normal for 48 hours.
4. PS3 dynamic theme
A dynamic theme for your PS3, featuring 7 original artworks of God of War: Ascension.
5. PSN avatar pack
A total of 5 avatars included: Perseus, Orion, Achilles, Odysseus and Kratos.
6. Pass for future DLC releases
Allows you to download future DLC for free.

In my opinion this is a pretty good deal. My favorites are the steelbook case and the PSN avatar pack. It also saves you maybe a few dollars on future DLC.

If you liked Borderlands, you will love this game-but then again, you probably already own it.  So if you're still on the fence about this game I have to ask, do you like FPS games, do you like RPG games, sandbox games or co-op games?  If you answered yes to any of those questions, you will enjoy this game.

Story-line
The first Borderlands barely made an excuse for a story-line whereas in Borderlands 2, there is a more immersible story-line with a villain that taunts you and baits you throughout the story-line of the whole game.

Graphics
The graphics and colors in Borderlands 2 are both artistic and detailed.  Importantly is that 90% of the time even when the screen is filled with enemies the frame-rate remains relatively smooth.  The environments are quite varied and the color pallet is much improved since the first game, this game is pretty and the colors really pop.

Sound
The sounds of the guns are varied, impactful, and the dialogue is well acted and the overall sound design is well done and really adds to the feeling of the Borderlands.

Gameplay
The enemies are new and much more impressive than in the first Borderlands.  There are fierce creatures and enemies to shoot and more importantly, the guns are much better and more varied than in Borderlands one.  If you want a ""realistic"" or ""military"" shooter, then go elsewhere, but if you enjoy sci-fi worlds, aliens and crazy-out-of-this-world guns, then you will love this game.  Naturally, this loot-filled, mission-heavy game is three times more fun if played with a friend.  Played by itself, the Borderlands can feel empty, boring and desolate.  The sense of power you have with your class's abilities are amazing and Axon's gun turret is far better than Roland's gun turret. The menu system to organize your loot and spend your skill points is much better than the first Borderlands.

Conclusion:
If you enjoy FPS, RPG/Sandbox games have a friend to play this game online with then what are you waiting for, you need to get this game! :)",Best Co-op Game that You can Play.,1355529600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4,True,"01 12, 2014",A1HNIJDIM23Y5I,B0050SX7BQ,GDP,"My wife and I finished this game a few days after it came out and I felt like reviewing it 3 months later for some reason (like with Heavy Rain, I played while she watched and pointed out things I missed, helped when I got stuck, etc.), and I thought I'd write a quickie on it.  Whereas ANYONE with a PS3 needs to have and play through Heavy Rain - get on that if you haven't - I can't say that everyone person needs Beyond Two Souls or that the game is ""for everyone.""  However, it was very good and worthwhile to play through.  The IGN score of 6.5 was, flatly put, wrong, and the seething comments from the majority of the comments on the review's webpage, as well as comments on various YouTube pages I've checked out for the game, prove that the reviewer just didn't get it.

Much like Heavy Rain, this game plays like a movie, only it feels even more like a movie than Heavy Rain.  The story is absolutely fantastic and original; I'm sure you know the premise of the heroine being a young woman, Jodie, who has a soul permanently tethered to her, Aiden, that can do everything from murder people, take over enemies briefly to get them to do things against their will, help her open doors and change things around in a computer's database or hard drive, to simply annoy her when she's trying to date a guy or have sex with said guy. Not to sound cliche, but it is so much deeper than all that, the story evolves in a Tarantino-esque fashion of flashbacks between little girl, teenage, and adult (well, as adult at a 24 year old is) Jodie.  So there are things as menial as how to dance without looking like a dork at her first boy-girl party and whether to choose to smoke pot, all the way down to (once she's been recruited by the CIA for her abilities) whether to take over the soul of a random enemy in an effort to execute a warlord and thus complete her mission, but with the knowledge that said random enemy will be killed and is the father of an innocent 5 year old boy.

The controls are a bit clumsy, basically just a mix of a failure to master the 3D camera, which is something you'd think would be mastered by now since the advent of Mario 64 on Nintendo 64, as well as annoying quicktime events.  However, the lackluster control system can easily be overlooked when you just look at the game and its various backgrounds and characters. An immense amount of detail went into each character, their facial expressions, and the game's locales. When you're trekking through a Siberian snow storm, you actually feel like you're shivering along with Jodie in the -40 degree bitter cold. When she finds out yet another horrifying and painful thing that has happened to her and/or her mother, you actually feel sad. When you see a band of hooligans beat the [...] out of a homeless guy and then attempt to burn down a building that another homeless woman, and her infant baby, are inside, you really do feel insanely angry. It's really something to experience.  The voice over actress does a fantastic job, as does Willem Defoe for his character.  A+ for acting, music, sound, and graphics as my final PS3 purchase.  As for graphics, we all know how good PS4 games look now, imagine how incredible games will look with a years time for developers to work on the kinks and understand truly how to develop for the system",A fresh take on video gaming; much needed IMO,1389484800,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

These are a quality option that at the same time are more economic than a Sony brand headset. I have ordered Amazon Basics items in the past and have never had any issues so I was confident when I ordered these.

I won't waste my time typing about the game, as there are hundreds of reviews out already.  Instead, I will be talking about how they did remastering, and the challenge.

The HD looks amazing.  I could hardly tell it once was a PS2 game when I put it in.  The colors just pop right out of the screen and hypnotizes you.

At least the first game I know is really challenging.  The checkpoints are about as far away as possible.  Also when you die, you go back to the most recent checkpoint.  In most shooters, your ammo goes back to how it was when you got the checkpoint mark.  In Ratchet and Clank, your ammo stays how it was when you die.  For example, if I had 25 Bomb Glove ammo, played through, and died with 18, I would re-spawn with 18 ammo.  Your bolts are the same way if you buy somethings or gain bolts.  Also bolt crates do no re-spawn when you die, so trying to maintain enough bolts to buy cool weapons, ammo for when you die 10,000 times, and buying things like info bots and Clank packs, your bolts are usually very low.

However, I think it also needs to be said that you should not expect to be throwing down the pwnage on the track right off the bat with this thing. As gamers, we are creatures of habit, and going from control racing to this device is in no way seamless (at least, it was not for me).  The good part is that if you can tough it out until you become accustomed to it, it will, without a doubt, elevate your racing to new levels of fun and realism.

I was particularly impressed with the accuracy and precision of this control, although I admit the only other device I have used to compare it to is for the Wii. After using this bad boy, the Wii device becomes almost laughable.

Like others here have said, the lack of having LB and RB is very annoying, and I hope that a solution to this is offered on Xbox Live so it can have total functionality.

Other than that, I really do not have much of anything to gripe about with this racing wheel, especially at its relatively inexpensive price. I think Microsoft's hardware people hit a home run with this one.","Fantastic, but with a learning curve",1328227200,2,,

While doing so I got my kid in bed and got myself a shower. I begin playing the game around 9pm... ...Next thing I know the sun is peaking in through my window. That's right I played this game for somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 hours on my first go, and didn't even realize it! I was just simply focused on racing, and winning, and having the time of my video gaming life! The game really is that awesome!

Now I haven't played GT5 because I don't have a PS3 yet this gen, but I had played every GT game before PS3 and I just have to say, this game is leaps and bounds more fun than any of those games! The sense of speed is spot on! I even noticed myself clenching my butt, and death gripping my controller, as I reached some of the greater speeds in some of the super-cars. That being said this game begs for a driving wheel, my legs would not sit still as I played because the game play has such a degree of realism that it just felt natural for them to be controlling the gas and break. Unfortunately xbox has a very poor selection of race wheels within my budget. This means that I will have to save my money for one of the expensive premium wheels from Fanatec. I have no doubt I will be the most happy with one of their quality wheels in the long run anyway, instead of a cheap MadCatz wheel or used 360 wheel.

The game is huge. Did I mention I played for 10 hours the first night? Well I'm only 1.1% through the World Tour, which is the main career option. I have no doubt that I will still be working on 100% by the time the next generation of consoles hits the shelves. I am also surprised to say that this game WILL be competing for game time with Skyrim (RPGs are my genre of choice and Skyrim is THE RPG), and I have no doubt it will win a lot of the time, the game is that fun!

I also went through and unlocked all of the current Autovista cars which unlocks the Halo Warthog in Autovista, but unfortunately you can't drive it... Yet. Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear gives you his usually humorous overview of each car in the Autovista, and some other British guy gives more detail on areas of the car you explore. Autovista is nice but not really something you will be using all the time, but it is awesome for showing off the amazing visuals to friends.

So to sum this up, if you are thinking of getting this gem of a racer, stop thinking and 'race' to the store and scoop it up! It will NOT disappoint! Plus the first wave of Forza 4 comes with a code to get more DLC cars, and if you can find a Limited Collector's Edition, it comes with even more bonus DLC cars.",Wow a racing sim that's actually fun to play!,1318550400,14,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The Campaign: Its short, its fun. Sometimes u get stuck, sometimes u beat a level without dying. The persuade ability is kind of over powered in my opinion.

The Coop: There are 9 missions, the level cap is 30 (your able to unlock everything by the time u reach level 30, rather than games that make u take tradeoffs (get this, don't get this)). For me, being able to unlock everything is a perk. Especially when u play with people who don't have everything unlocked and they are a bit surprised with how powerful u become.

Dont let this confuse you, even at the most powerful rank, some of the coop missions u need 4 players on to be able to do their hardest setting. And one of them, me and my friend are not able to do even tho we are highest rank and playing with random people. For one of them, I believe ""Scandinavia"" you WILL NEED 4 players max level and be lucky. Your robot friend dies fast!

Anyways, level cap 30, there are about 10 different powers you can unlock, my favorite at the moment is E-drain which takes life from the opponent and gives it to me. And my second favorite is battery which regenerates the energy bars of my teammates and gets me a lot of points. Plus, I get many thank you's when Im using that ability :).

In conclusion on a Scale of 10: Im going to give this game a 9 overall. The campaign is short, but sweet. That gets a 7, and the Coop is very fun (if you have friends that also have the game and occasionally when your playing public games and your teammates are as good/better than you. Then its a blast! Coop gets a 9.5. In my opinion, the coop on this game is more fun than Halo or Gears of War with the amount of teamwork required and the amount of powerups you can unlock and use.

All that being said, I would not buy this for $60!!! Coordinate with a friend (or if your an overachiever, 3 friends) wait till it goes down to $30 in price and all 4 of you buy it! It is a blast in coop with friends!","Great for $40, not so sure for $60",1330646400,3,{'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'},

3,False,"09 26, 2012",AP1J0KYIWTFGD,B0050SZBP6,Drag,"I have played many MMO's throughout my time and have played WOW since 04 release date, there are many pros and cons to the changes that wow has made, ill list them as follows:
Pros:
Everyone likes a new race so we at least get a completely new race to play with.  Monk class is actually a blast to play as well.
The areas are beautiful to look at and huge at that!
Wow still stays at its roots to a certain extent, as far as gameplay, hit a button theres an attack, no diving life guild wars 2
The new pet system is welcomed
A completely new island is always fun to explore and its huge so lots to do
The dungeons are still great and well made

Essentially it's what you expect out of a world of warcraft game.  It's not revolutionary but it hasn't changed to the point where it's a completely different game. There are many that are already bored and for some reason they thought it was going to change the whole game for a completely different feel.  Know that this is classic world of warcraft with a crappy leveling system. There are many perks and the game is still fun but at some point quest to quest hoping as quick as possible feels like a grind fest. I honestly don't know anyone who reads the quest line.
Cons:
The leveling system is just horrid!! 6 talents for 90 levels could have been the worst thing world of warcraft has done to its game.  There is absolutely no incentive/fun in leveling a toon at all now. Every 15 levels you get to pick 1 skill is ridicules!
I said a new race was nice the only problem is that the new race is a Panda, yes I know pandas have been in the story since the 90s, but that could be the reason no one ever read the stories. Pandas are not a good addition whatsoever; it makes you feel like you're playing a Childs game.
Graphics have been improved but another problem is that framerate in different areas are really bad, and I know it's because there are lots of people in area, but is it odd that guild wars 2 framerate stayed constant even in the heaviest areas meanwhile an 8 year old polished game frames drop and some latency issues.

---Overall if you were a wow player that loved the game but just got bored because of LACK OF CONTENT then you most likely will enjoy this expansion, you may not agree with all the changes but the game does a great job of introducing a lot of new dungeons and features. But if you're a wow player  that got bored of the gameplay itself then you will defiantly not enjoy this game, because in my opinion gameplay has not changed and the talent system is horrid. It seems to me that blizzard is focusing more on PVP this expansion and getting ready for a new MMO. But only Future will tell.",A True Review by Dragu,1348617600,28,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Game play:
  -Movement has been improved ten fold.  Bioware was smart to include a new cover/movement system based on Gears of War.
  -Customization of your armor and weapons have finally made a return.  The developers have seamlessly merged the Detail gear control from ME1 and the simplified controls from ME2 to create a very pleasing blend of simplicity with just the right amount of customization.
  -Seeing the ripples from the choices and characters met in the first two installments is very well done.  Sometimes it is a major point in the game, Tali and Legion for example, and other times it is minor, a character in passing or a news report you over hear.
  -A great deal of the characters from ME2 are unplayable in ME3.  Which does make sense as it has been some time since the end of ME2, and the turn over of the Normandy SR2 to the Alliance.  The characters have dispersed and moved on with their respective lives.  It is very nice to get your ME1 playable characters back, Liara and either Kadien or Ashley.
  -All of the decisions made in ME1, ME2, and ME3 lead you to a single decision.  Meaning that all of those previous decisions have NO IMPACT on the final choice.  If you keep this in mind the entire ending will be ten times better.

The Endings
All three primary endings are beautifully done.  Do they answer every question, no, were they supposed to... in my opinion, no.  However I will not argue if Bioware releases DLC which expands the story.  I will not go into a lot of detail concerning the endings for those of you who are looking to purchase/rent this game.  These endings are not the typical ""American"" ending... happiness, sunflowers, and daisys.  They are gritty, hard, and dirty.

Overall I enjoyed the entire seires and ME3 was a perfect ending to that series.  If you liked ME2 then you will like ME3.

08/28/12 - Review update based upon the new release of DLC for the improved endings.  The improved/exteneded endings answer so many of the questions that were posted from the original endings.  You have a total of 4 endings possible now, all are worth seeing.

5,True,"10 27, 2011",A1AQCJDV3ZT2S6,B0050SXVK8,J. Cadieux,"First, I have not played these games before on PSP.  I just finished both games and here are my thoughts:

Chains of Olympus:  I was really impressed with this overall.  When I thought that it started as a PSP game, I was even more impressed.  This game must have been pretty hot stuff on that system.  It looks good, plays well and was definitely fun.  As another reviewer pointed out, the story was forgettable and I am literally having problems remembering it, even though I finished it 2 days ago.  The cut-scenes are not in high-definition, and look blurry, but this is a minor concern.  It was pretty easy.  I was well over halfway into the game before I died for the first time.

Ghost of Sparta:  This game was awesome!  I loved the story and it feels integral to the series.  I actually felt a little ripped-off because I never got the chance to play it before.  The cut-scenes are at a much higher resolution than the Chains of Olympus scenes.  The gameplay is great and I really enjoyed the final battle scenes.  It's hard to believe it began as a portable game.  There is no question that Ghost of Sparta is the better of the two games in terms of visuals, gameplay and story.

Complaints would be that both games have some unskippable cut-scenes and sometimes if you die you have to watch the entire scene again before you can get another chance in the battle.

Yes you can also do away with the cable connecting your controller to your headset but the loss of sound clarity and easy access to mute and chat volume controls make this a definite lose lose situation.

Several ergonomic design failures with the XP500 force you to struggle when trying to locate a button on your headset.  While I had to do just that with the X4 to control game volume, the designers made the buttons on the XP500 small and in most instances flush with the casing on the earpieces.  The game volume control is a small wheel on the left earpiece and the chat volume a rocker switch on the right earpiece, neither lending themselves to easy manipulation during a chaotic battle.  The makers tout the ability to quickly switch form one sound preset to another while in the game to select the perfect sound system for the style of play that you need, I'm afraid that is not going to happen.  This control is one of several buttons on the bottom of your earpiece and is flush with the casing, good luck trying to find it and rotate through the selections trying to find the one you need without losing track of the game going on around you.  Several problems that have been with the system from the start have still not been addressed, the ear cups are still too small, the padding is hardly plush, and the cups are very shallow.  At this price these are hardly for children, so why not design them for the adults that are going to be using them?

As far as the sound quality of the preset selections, they may be a fantastic example of sound filtering, but it doesn't quite come off as described in the advertising.  When you need to hear the footsteps of approaching opponents, they aren't amplified, everything else is knocked down leaving you with a distorted flat unpleasant game sound, not what I want to hear when using 260.00 dollar headphones.

I honestly think the overall sound quality is better through my four year old X4's, the sound is richer and more balanced, and there is definitely less to hassle with as far as controls go on the X4.  I guess I'll stick with them and order as many spare puck cables as I can while they are still available.

If you want to buy into the hype of the XP500 go right ahead and give them a whirl, but I'm sending them back as very marginal performers.","So it works with Xbox and PS3, that is the only improvement.",1322611200,6,,

I was skipping all of the cut scenes, because they had no impact on how I played the game whatsoever. If this were just a single player game, it would probably get 2 stars.

The multiplayer though is phenominal. It's a delicate and well thought out balance between a level-up shooter, a space western, and a futuristic RTS. The game structures are very similar to every other shooter on the market (CTF, Deathmatch, Zone protect), but the execution makes it a whole different ball game.

You can play the game however you want, and your role fits into your team concept. That's why I love modes like capture the flag in this game. It allows you to take your role you are best at and utilize it toward a team goal. You can play the game a million different ways: as a quick draw offensive player using a sidewinder and your equipped gun, driving a tank right into the enemy base and shelling from afar, flying  a hawk and bombing from above, or my personal favorite, as a defender fortifying your base.

Most FPS multiplayer rely on kills and headshots to give XP. Luckily Starhawk utilizes an XP system that also rewards defensive players who build structures and defend the base. You don't need to be a great FPS player to be great at this game. I personally like to defend my bases, so many of my XP come from auto turrets and building points.

El motivo principal es la necesidad que suple, soy una persona que estudia y trabaja tiempo completo, esto deja muy poco tiempo para poder jugar. Usualmente solo me es posible hacerlo por la noche, cuando casi siempre ya toda mi familia est dormida en mi hogar. Estos audfonos suplen esta necesidad por completo y lo mejor de todo es que no es necesario tener ningn cable de por medio que dificulte la experiencia.

A simple vista, al menos suple la necesidad, pero hay 3 puntos de suma importancia que se debe resaltar extra a la necesidad suplida.

1) Facilidad de Uso: A diferencia de otros Headsets(Alambricos),  muchas veces es posible que nos abrumemos con el como conectarlo, como instalarlo, como calibrar el sonido, y diversas cosas que por no tener un conocimiento tan amplio con respecto al producto. Estos audfonos son EXTREMADAMENTE sencillos de conectar. Solamente se saca de la caja, se ponen a cargar por primera vez, una luz roja se enciende en el micrfono indicando que se est cargando. En promedio de una hora a hora y media ya esta cargado en su totalidad. Para usarlo solo es necesario conectar el receptor USB, y con el PS3 encendido, presionar por 2 segundos el extremo superior izquierdo del headset, si los tienes puestos escucharas un sonido que indica que se han encendido y en el micrfono se encender una luz de color azul. As de simple ya lo puedes usar. Ahora para calibrarlo, es tambin sencillo. En primer logar todos los controles estn del lazo izquierdo de los audfonos. Atrs una barra para el volumen, muy til y fcil de accesar, en la parte frontal otra barra pequea para balancear el sonido de ambiente y chat, El la parte superior el botn de Surround Sound. Y as de simple se puede utilizar, y ver cual es el sonido optimo que requieras.

2) El precio: Si existen headsets mas baratos, pero no son wireless ni mucho menos especficos para PS3. Pero en promedio headsets con las cualidades, y con la calidad de sonido de este oscilan en $200-$300, con 7.1, y muchos siguen siendo alambricos. Estos audfonos cuestan $100, mucho menos solamente con el precio de entrada, y con todas los extras para que funcione en conjunto con el ps3, sumamente recomendado. En lo personal me costaron $65 dolares ya que lo aparte el da que salieron a la venta con oferta, pero no hubiera dudado en pagar los $100 de no haber adquirido la oferta.

3) EL SONIDO: Mi prueba de fuego fue Killzone 2, tengo muchos mas juegos nuevos, pero necesitaba probarlo en guerra, la cual fue una experiencia increble. Detalles de audio que no haba podido escuchar jugando sin ellos, cada disparo se siente solido, la msica instrumental y ambiente en los escenarios tiene una calidad tan clara, y aumenta grandemente la calidad de experiencia. Desconozco si el juego es compatible con 7.1, pero de no serlo el audio igual fue increble. Posterior prob pistas de audio, las cuales tambin suenan sumamente bien, tiene cierto efecto 3D, sin llegar a la calidad de experiencia en el juego. Al tal punto que prob Plants vs Zombies, y fue lo mximo escuchar cada gemido de zombies, la grama cuando la pisan y detalles nuevamente que jams haba percibido.

Recomendados, en absoluto. Ve tu necesidad, y si te gusta ver pelculas, escuchar msica o jugar, pero no quieres molestar a otras personas con el audio o simplemente no quieres comprar o gastar tanto en un teatro en casa 7.1, si solamente lo usaras tu. Debes darte la oportunidad.

5,True,"10 7, 2011",A1G659AQG3KIH6,B00542ZQJO,Unit543,"(300 hours in) I am a Demon Souls warrior. So going into this game I knew what I was getting into. Now I want to get one thing out first,this is 10 times harder then Demon Souls hands down. I won't make this an extensive review just pros and cons.

Pros:
Giant Bosses which are beautifully designed
Beautiful Open World of Death and Despair
Music is Amazing,never in a game the music sets the mood just right
Battle Mechanics
Tons of Secrets
CE: For what I paid(retail)it's a great gift and add on for my collection..Though I would prefer a physical guide, I purchased the official guide either way.

Cons:
Enemies that are harder then bosses
Flasks instead of herbs
Being cursed(a pain in the a$$ to get rid of if you are broke)
Cheap sometimes
Losing souls but that comes with the territory

All in all this game can be GOTY. It's well crafted and difficult but not to a point it's unbearable.. Just grind and level up..Also a tip,be sure to save after you defeat bosses,you may go in a area that you won't make it out with your souls. 10/5 Must buy

UPDATE: I am now level 198 and all I can say is wow. This game is on my mind all day,I'm at work and all I can think was kicking a$$ in the forest and invading the guilty. This game is massive and kept me so infused with it I don't care to look at the past exclusives that released. Like crack this game has me addicted. Beautiful,Amazing,Masterpiece and captivating. Dark souls will suck you in with no remorse. GOTY!",Death has got to be easy because life is hard,1317945600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},
5,False,"10 24, 2012",A2AQ1VVZGE9H3S,B0054IN5AA,Carlos Gustavo,"I have to say PS3 is by far the best console ever created, I don't even know how people even consider having a Xbox, Wii I can understand, but PS3's 1080P resolution on a big screen Sony HD TV is unbeatable. I'm saying these things because this is a must have game for your PS3. This game looks very pretty, the images and colors are gorgeous and it really makes you appreciate your console.

I love fighting games and I have to say most fighting games are best played with the D-Pad as opposed of the analog joystick. For example with Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition it is so hard to play with the joystick. This one is the other way around. I have been playing fighting games with the D-Pad since the 90s, and other than Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection I never thought I would love playing a game with the joystick, KOF XIII responds so well to the joystick that it becomes addictive. Even better is having an arcade stick controller to have the full game experience.

Another great thing about this game are all the characters, they truly have picked the best characters from the wide range of awesome SNK fighting games, this game has absolutely the best ones, plus they all look awesome and very well drawn. The customization of colors is really good, but just the original look  of them is great. Except for Terry Bougard, for some reason they blow him way too much out of proportion, a leaner Terry Bougard was way cooler back in the day, but other than that, they are all cool, specially K' who is always the coolest.

Overall the game feels very complete, which is always a great thing, it has everything you wish from a fighting game, unlockables for playing the game (a nice high-def zoom-in gallery), story mode, arcade mode, practice mode, tutorial, versus mode (to enjoy fighting with your buddies), customizations, online mode, and even missions.

The difficulty settings are perfect, it is very rare to find a game with accurate well thought out difficulty settings that actually respond well to your playing. That's something they did good in the previous one, I was afraid this one was going to be different, but it wasn't, this one is just as good, the playing has a great feel and it is not unrealistic at all, in fact it is just right, very hard is supposed to be very hard not impossible, other games fail in that, this one doesn't, they did a good job on that.

Under missions there is an option where you can fight with all the characters until you run out of health, one fight at the time with one guy, like an endurance type of thing called survival. This is by far my favorite part of the game, in fact they could take everything away (except the versus mode of course) and just keep this section, and the game will still be awesome. In fact now I wish every single fighting game had this endurance thing, the difficulty settings are well done for it as well.

I honestly don't understand the story, but I have to say that the dialogues (which are a complete different thing) are very smart in the sense that they are simple and very innocent, without having the need to follow any storyline, they are better than the street fighter ones, the street fighter ones are too short and lose sense because of that, these ones on the other hand, and the game in general, give you the real feel of an anime cartoon.

I do not like having to reload everytime someone sees me because there is no ""knock-out"" option after combat starts (at least not until you get a specialized cross-bow bolt).  By the time I did get that cross-bow I had already lost interest in the game.

If you run-and-gun, killing everything in your path, it should take significantly less time to complete.  I believe that this game merits a few play-throughs in order to experience the different ways to go about completing missions.  If you like Assassin's Creed and Deus Ex, consider this a hybrid of the two - a stealthy first-person shooter.

What I like about the game:
+You can have a completely kill-free game - in fact there's an achievement for this.
+Optional missions serve a purpose to the main mission rather than being tacked on as time fillers.
+Stealth, as well as non-lethal means of taking out enemies, is well implemented.
+Combat controls are responsive and easy to master - riposte/counter-attacks work seemlessly.
+Learned abilities are freakin' cool - controlling plague rats to take down foes?  Check!
+Game looks great on the PC (haven't tried it on PS3 or Xbox)
+Voice acting is exceptional.

I bought six (6) of these to use for my Dualshock 3 and also the Dualshock 2 controllers. Both the triggers were fairly easy to snap onto the L2 and R2 buttons. Make sure to align the bottom of the triggers to the bottom of the Dualshock 3/PS3 Controller L2, R2 buttons and just snap them on with some pressure. The triggers make pressing the L2 and R2 buttons feel durable and just has a better feeling. The silicons for the joysticks needed some more work to put on. Flip the silicons inside out and then back to normal. Then stretch the silicons out and just put them over the bottom of the joystick starting from the opposite side of you and all the way around with some pressure. I use the silicons for both Dualshocks. They fit nicely, gives you some grip and prevents any residue to the original joysticks.

This is the only time I'd recommend the Microsoft and Sony versions over a Nintendo version. Seriously. If this is out for the Wii U someday...... Good luck on sales, Sega.

But enough of the boring stuff. LEt's get to the game info.

Sonic Generations is a side scrolling 3D adventure, much like the 1991 STH. Except there's a new twist on it. You can play as the Modern Sonic, the one on the lefty, or Classic Sonic, the one on the righty. The gameplay is the same as Sonic rush and S.R Adventure, where you complete two stages then fight the boss, but you can play either stage first, as M.S (Modern Sonic), or C.S (Classic Sonic). You may see some familiar faces from past games, you may not (depending on how long you've been Sonic-ing) But they are all easy to beat. *Lziboidar* (The final boss from SA2B *Scrambled to prevent spoilers*)has taken 100 steps down in difficulty, the 2ND weird boss of SAK, and *Geg Peromre* (From SH) have all been decreased in difficulty. And the Mite Traee? That ACTUALLY made me die twice! WOW! *Dripping with sarcasm*

PROS:
Nice graphics for its time
Classic Sonic platforming action
Semi-funny dialouge
Chili dogs

CONS
Unresponsive gameplay
bad physics
Game is overall slow (bad FRPS)
Can be beaten in 3-4 hours (not counting mission mode, because the mission mode is more tedious than fun.)

Classic Sonic having the ability to Homing Attack. -_-' Seriously?

1/5 YOU DIED. Do I even need to explain? The jump is terrible, the lag is worse than Mario Tennis Open and Code of Princess, the FRPS is slower than Sonic Rush (Which was released in '05)and all those cons above.

The only good this is the fact that you can play as both M.S and C.S

'Nuff said. Don't waste your hard earned cash, wait for Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed. If that doesn't redeem Sonic, nothing will. If you don't want to wait for that, go buy Mario Kart 7, Samurai Warriors Chronicles or Kid Icarus Uprising.

I was also ready to try a space-related strategy game as a change of pace from my terrestrial favorites such as the Total War and Civ series. Amazon had no reviews on this game so I looked elsewhwhere. I found it to get decent reviews, and the under $20 price didn't seem too steep. The purchase and download went smoothly. Then I tried to play the game. The camera controls are so utterly maddening they make the game unplayable. It's like golf without the occasional great shot or the beer-cart girl: FRUSTRATING, FRUSTRATING, FRUSTRATING! What's fun about that? The main problem for me was the time it takes to get the camera where you need it. The camera is set up to move around the action from any angle. Kind of cool idea because, after all, you're in space. But it presents a problem. The tutorial says that you can move the camera N,S,E or W by moving the cursor to the screen-edge. But you can't always do that. So there can be action going on just a bit under, over or to the side of you current camera angle and you can't just edge-scroll the camera in that direction. Instead you have to try to rotate the camera one way or the others so that it can center on the action. Meanwhile you can't issue ordes to a specific ship, for example, because you can't select it while you're trying to spin the camera hither, tither and yon. I would rather play Shaq Fu than this.

GIMME! GIMME! GIMME - A MODE AFTER MIDNIGHT!
There is a number of modes, I am sure you will find the one for you. There is, of course the classic Dance Mode, where you get to follow the dancing figures on the screen, trying to match their moves holding the Wiimote in one hand (only one is required - corresponding to the gloved hand of the dancer). There is also a Story Mode, where you get to participate in a mini-musical with ABBA, enhanced with their original music videos, snippets from their tours and numerous pictures. And then there is the Karaoke!

I AM A MARIONETTE!
What is the use of having an ABBA dancing exergame if one cannot sing along, right? Well, this game got you (almost) covered. In the Karaoke Mode the lyrics appear under the dancing figures and they get highlighted with the rhythm in order for your to sing along. It is a very fun mode, one clearly missing form the other JUST DANCE games - if it was not for the issue of the missing microphone.

MONEY! MONEY! MONEY!
For the karaoke to function properly you will clearly need a microphone (such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Wii-Vantage-USB-Microphone/dp/B000Z67GH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Wii Vantage USB Microphone</a>, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-Microphones-for-the-Wii/dp/B000WOSATM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech Microphones for the Wii</a>&nbsp;or even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nintendo-GameCube-Wii-Microphone/dp/B000H77DFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nintendo GameCube & Wii Microphone</a>) - as, unfortunately, NONE is included. We had to order one separately. Of course, until it too arrived, my wife was far from discouraged from simply singing along anyway!
This is where the game looses the perfect score, though: the karaoke mode is a major selling point so UBISOFT deciding not to include the required microphone (which is essential in fully enjoying the game) was a bad (and cheap, I might add!) marketing decision.

TAKE A CHANCE ON ME!
Once you solve the missing microphone issue, you will be having tons of fun with this game. I always liked their  sound yet I was never a huge fan of the ABBA.

Pros: how i feel
-it is very comfortable
-the thumb rest spot on the left side is a nice touch and very well placed
-the thumb buttons are well laid out
-the lighting effects are cool but you can turn it on and off
-build quality feels sturdy and well made
-metal body!!!

Cons:
-it is not a first use and fall in love type of mouse, im still getting used to it after using the logitech g700
-you can feel a slight wobble of the scroll wheel when scrolling but not a major deal
-there is 0 labeling of the mouse on the actual mouse, so for future reference it is best to keep the box that it came with

Neutral: not really a con but need time getting used to
-the software, it feels like a beta software, but it is still usable. it gets the job done as for binding keys and the keys working for what i needed it to do.

Tips:
-download the latest firmware and software driver from the Corsair website
-in the software driver keep ""Hardware Playback"" checked
-double clicking on the LED section of the profiles you want and assign the profiles to specific LED spots then click ""Save to M90"" this will save all the profile changes to the mouse

This mouse and the key binds work for me for StarCraft 2 and Battlefield 3

Hakuoki is just that. The characters are very realistic through flaws, miscalculations, and being defeated at some points of the game. The story of the characters meshed well with the historical period and was fascinating during every playthrough. The main character isn't what I would consider ideal, but at least she isn't annoying and considering her background and the time period, her shy/innocent/helpless personality is to be expected. The music plus the characters' changing portraits (with different postures and expressions) was great. The artwork was beautiful.

Now for the flaws... One key flaw that I found with the game is that the protagonist's personality is set regardless of the choices you make as the player. It would make more sense for your choices to affect her personality at least in some way. Sarcastic choices should make her say similar things. Rude choices should make her bolder or at least less cautious about what she says. Also, the translation could have really been improved. There were spelling mistakes consistently throughout the game. About two per chapter, I would guess. I also would have liked to see more done with the ""hidden"" love interest's story. Why can't you leave the Shinsengumi and hang out with the other side for a while?

2,True,"09 1, 2012",A14DR2RP5PAKNS,B005WXIO44,Laura,"I have played and loved the Stronghold games, until Stronghold 3, that is.

Likes: I like that I can rotate buildings at smaller incriments rather than 90 degrees. I like that I can zoom in and see better detail. I like the music a lot. The day changed from night to day and there is rain at times. Graphics are great.

However, theses ""likes"" are superficial at best, and mean very little compared to bugs that make the game nearly unplayable. The dislikes far outwiegh any likes I have.

Dislikes: I don't like that the help menu isn't helpful and the turorial is basically useless. I sat in one level for the longest time, wondering why my population stats didn't go up to meet the level requirements, even though I had plenty of houses built, only to find out rather by accident that you have to PUT THEM TO WORK for them to count as population. Although, this wasn't always the case in subsequent levels, so added to this list is the fact that some levels inexplicably follow different rules without explination. I read through the help menu, and went back and retook the turorial, but neither told me this.

Also, there are numberous bugs in the game. STILL. I had read the negative reviews, but I had also read that the bugs had been fixed. I only recently bought the game through Steam (thank god at a discount) and thought these would be fixed. Well, there are still annoying bugs that literally mean life and death. Just an example, the war dogs don't attack when they should, bad guys can kill them while they are penned up and once they are realeased, they often stand there without attacking. When they do finally attack (if any are left alive at this point), they attack ANYONE in the area including your own soldiers or peasants, which is unforguvable. So, the war dogs are essentually useless. UPDATE: this seems to have been fixed somewhat in subsequent updates. The war dogs are still too slow to be released but once released they do their thing as they are supposed to.

Enemies detect and automatically avoid traps. Why even have traps if the enemy is just going to go around them! I have yet to have an enemy fall into a trap and die! So, traps are really useless.

Strange graphics glitches like huge arrow heads flying over the landscape during combat. UPDATE: I've seen no more graphics glitches after recent updates.

Soldiers who attack or don't attack all on their own to get slaughtered. Ranged units such as spearthrowers who run into close combat to again be slaughtered. In this regard, ranged units are worse than useless. UODATE: this still happens. Some units don't have aggressive stance and have to be told to attack or they just stand there and die. If I select the units and click to attack, they will attack, but once that wave of enemies is dead they stand around and let the next wave just kill them.

Units that won't respond to repeated mouse clicks. UPDATE: There is still a ""click"" bug where I often have to select units and click 3-4 times to get them to respond. By that time the enemies are killing them or past them killing villigers.

People start to leave my castle even when my rating is above zero. UPDATE: this still happens and it happens ALL THE TIME, over and over, they leave and come back, leave and come back, with an abive zero approval rating.

Oxen that don't work and have to be deleted and rebuilt sometimes multiple times before they'll start delivering built up cargo. UPDATE: still happens.

Units get stuck, won't move or attack and get killed. In two hours of game play this happened three times: lord got stuck in a wood cutters area and was nearly killed (I had to delete the wood cutter to be able ti move him), archers got stuck in ruins and were torn apart by wolves, armed peasents got stuck in another wood cutters area and were killed. I've seen enemies also get stuck in my wood cutters areas, and they cannit be reached and killed by my guys but they sure can still attack and kill my people! Though my guys cannot attack whwn stuck.

A market place that is still available as a building but since you can now buy/sell from individual stock buildings (such as stockpile) the marketplace is rendered essentually useless.

When I completed the last level in the ecconomic campaign, the last level repeated when I hit the ""next"" button.

Hmmm, how many ""useless"" items can you count? And that's just off the top of my head after only 6 hours of gameplay.

Even at a discount, its a waste of money. Shame on you guys for releasing this game like this!! An hour of game play shows so many bugs. It's hard for me to believe the developers had no idea since they are so numberous and frequent, which means they had to know and released this game as is. So very very disappointed. I've gone back to Stronhold 2, and will not be purchasing the next game in the series unless I have proof it's worth it and even then I will wait until it's discounted rather than risk spending full price on another game as bad as stronghold 3.

UPDATE: On some online forums, I found how to move your troops and have them respond to attacks. You hold down the CTRL button when you select and move them. Huge improvement. Still, the turorial and instructions are lousy for not telling you this!",Frustrating,1346457600,4,{'Platform:': ' PC'},

I played the BETA for PS3 when it came out, and immediately got addicted. But you jhave to have a clean brain (no drugs or alcohol), so that you can think/react extremely fast to keep up with the big-dogs online.

Graphics sucked in the BETA, but are better, even on the lowest setting on my PC, than the PS3.

I love how you can level-up your character and weapons, get IR scopes, and destroy pretty-much the entire map!

Very realistic Sound makes you have to turn up your home theatre system, and you'd never know you weren't in a real war zone.

Also, the addition of a SINGLE PLAYER campaign was a nice surprise.

I don't normally buy a $60 game when they first come out, but this one was definately worth it.

It is kinda stupid that you have to be on-line in order to play (even just single player), mabey they'll fix that little problem in #4, but for now, i have internet, so I'm not complaining.

But if you want the most out of your game, expect to upgrade your graphics card, get high-speed internet, and pull the drug-needle outta your arm, or you're screwed.

Was this going to be another system with terrible tracking, lame or kiddie-only games? Fortunately, Kinect definitely impresses with both its tracking and its assortment of games.

Some say that Kinect can't see you well, but in my house where I use Kinect (this was the second one I purchased and we use it in two rooms) I have excellent tracking. The key is lighting and range. I made sure to turn on lights all around us, not just a lamp in front of us or above us, and made sure that the Kinect was up on top of the TV or on a shelf above the TV and moved back from the Kinect about 10 feet. When you set it up like this you will get excellent range and tracking. The only time I have trouble is when I swap out for one of my kids and Kinect has to try to find them because they are so much shorter. The only time I have face recognition trouble is when I only have a lamp on above me. Otherwise this works great.

Kinect also has a great mic. Now that Xbox has gone through its big upgrade this last week, we use Kinect to search things by just speaking what we want it to look for. We also use it to control apps, like ESPN, where it can be used as a Tivo-like controller but with your voice, ""Xbox pause"" and ""Xbox play."" There has been two times when my wife and I were watching Netflix and some combination of what the actors on the screen said cause the Kinect to think we commanded it to fast forward. When we replayed that moment on the show it did it again. So something the actors said, even though it wasn't ""Xbox fast forward"" triggered the response.

The games for Kinect are awesome. You have the kid games, which our kids love, but you also have real sport games. I loved bowling for Wii, but Kinect Sports Season One and Two are way better in the game options and tracking. Ping Pong is a great example where Kinect watches and tracks you as the game gets tougher and faster without trouble. This package comes with Fruit Ninja, which is a blast! Use your arms to slice the fruit avoiding the bombs. Two players can go at the same time. (If you didn't buy this pack but already have a Kinect, Xbox Live has a DLC of Fruit Ninja for $10.) Adventures is almost an excersize game in that it makes you use so many muscles and endurance is a major part of the games included. At the same time the games are a blast.

Kinect is a game changer. It's not a wand like PS3 or Wii, works way better tracking, has voice controls and a bunch of top notch games. Perfect for Christmas or anytime. Highly recommended.",A Must Have Add-on,1323993600,,,

The music, the ""universe"", the characters, the locations, the lore, everything about this game is awesome.

It's a great mix of First Person Shooter, Roleplay, and Survival free-roam. The enemies are vast and unique, from simple giant scorpions, to giant sword made of a car bumper wielding Mutants.

5,True,"08 21, 2014",A3FVYK70PCJZOP,B0068INSUM,Shawn,"To Start off the review, I've been using mechanical keyboards for a long time now, and this keyboard model is one of the best that I've used in a long time. It is extremely durable, and well built, with no issues at all. The keyboard itself is fairly simple and straight forward, so for those of you looking for just a plain and simple mechanical keyboard without all of the extra nonsense thrown in, this is for you. That being said, the keyboard preforms exactly how it should, quick, precise, and without fail. The typing experience is phenomenal. Now, lets cover some of the key switches that are more popular, and the ones that I have personally used/owned.

Red Switches: Red switches are linear, meaning they go straight up and down with no bump or click. These are preferable for gaming because it is faster to rapid press each key, though, it is not preferable to typing for most because it is almost like dipping your fingers into water, elegant, but no resistance and you cant tell at times that you are pressing it down, so keep that in mind.

Blue Switches: These are perfect for the typist, light touch with a bump and click, good for gaming too but not as fast as the reds. I've used this model with blue switches, and the razer keyboard with blue switches, and they have served me well in all fields. These switch types with the clicks are loud though, so keep that in mind if you operate in an environment that needs silence for others around you.

Green Switches: These are my current switches, and I love them for their heavy press, these are not for the average consumer. These are very heavy and long sessions of typing can get a little rigorous. The benefit to this is the fact that it makes fat fingering very hard to do as the keys will not actuate with the force that would normally activate all the other switches. As a final note, these are also clicky and have the bump feedback.

Brown Switches: I have no personally used these, but they are basically red switches but with a tactical bump, meaning you feel the key actuate telling you it has preformed that action.

So over all, there is some information about the keys, with just a bit of jargon, but if you are into mechanical keyboards you need to know what some of it means so I hope that provided a simple explanation of the experiences you can expect to have. This keyboard is a phenomenal model for gamer, typists, and anyone just getting into mechanical keyboards. It has a sleek design, and is very sturdy, not one of my keyboards of this model has had any issues in over two years.","No Jargon Reviews - Green, red, brown, and blue switch models",1408579200,,"{'Size:': ' Large', 'Color:': ' XT - CherryMX Green'}",

But sometimes it's nice to have something different, hence the Vita and the DS we've had.  Some games we like are only available on the other platforms.

He loves Mario Kart on the Wii, and Sonic racing on the Xbox and the PS Vita.  The other day we were in a local brick and mortar and he was playing the demo 3DS there with Mario Kart 7.  I hadn't seen 7 yet, so I checked it out, and was pretty impressed.

I had never paid much attention to the 3DS system, so it was my first time to really look at it.  And I have to say, I was impressed at what they accomplished without the use of any glasses.

The stick layout is SO much nicer now with this, compared to the standard DS layout with just the four way pad on the left.  The sliding stick is awesome, and makes gameplay a lot more enjoyable.

The bundled things were fun too, taking advantage of the cameras to put your own face on a little helicopter that you get to shoot in your own virtual room.

It's comfortable enough to hold for some extended gaming, and while the graphics aren't up to par with the Vita for example, they work well with the games that they have.  The Super Mario 3D land is quite a bit of fun, a nice change from the normal 2D scrolling side to side.

And the 3D effect is just amazing for something this small.  It really makes a huge difference when you're playing the games.

I surprised him with it this weekend, first by giving him the Mario Kart 7 card, then watching his disappointment when it wouldn't fit in the old DS.  He was sad, and ready to take it back, then I pulled out the new 3DS from behind a blanket on the couch and said, ""At least we should try it in here first.""  The look on his face was worth it.

If you're a fan of the Nintendo games available on these, and you haven't really checked one of these out in person, do so.  It's amazing, and well worth it at the prices you can get them at now this long after launch.",Now I wonder why I waited so long to get us one...,1374364800,2,,

McAtee,"As a veteran of the original Witcher, I was thrilled to learn that there would be a sequel, but as I knew from past experience, there was likely to be an updated version with significant bug fixes and DLC.  I held off buying the game until the Enhanced Edition was released, so I can't comment on the differences, but The Witcher 2 is an incredible solo RPG and follows up - and improves upon - the original better than most sequels ever do.

There are already numerous reviews detailing the game, so rather than tell you more of the same, I'll just add a couple of thoughts.  First of all, despite meeting the system requirements listed on the box, I found the game to be nearly unplayable on an old 2.6 GHz Core 2 Quad with 6GB DDR2 and nVidia GeForce 9400GT running Windows 7 64-bit.  Not exactly a gaming workhorse, but it didn't struggle at all with numerous other games, and TW2 brought it nearly to a standstill.  Upgrading the video card to a slightly more modern 630GT made all the difference in the world, allowing me to run at a higher resolution and with more ""eye candy"" enabled without sacrificing performance.  (I also added 2GB of RAM for a total of 8GB, which I doubt made any particular difference.)

The gameplay is fluid and fast-paced, the world is beautiful and detailed, and character interaction is some of the best I've encountered in an RPG.  Sure, you can't carry on a conversation with every single NPC or stray very far off the beaten path (eg. Elder Scrolls, Gothic, etc.) but rarely does anything feel off-limits.  Speaking of limits, there is virtually no limit to the carnage, cursing, nudity and sexual content, with the latter also being several levels beyond the ""sex cards"" of the original.  As other reviewers have made quite clear, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT FOR KIDS.  The look and feel of TV series like Spartacus and Game of Thrones matched with wildly branching storyline make for an exceptionally immersive experience.

There is only one glaring complaint I have about TW2, although it's not unique to this game.  I feel as though ""boss"" fights have become a tired gimmick, but without revealing too much, there are definitely some battles where all of Geralt's combat abilities are basically thrown out the window in favor of just repeating a single manuever over and over.  I can think of several such encounters where I felt as though learning the ins and outs of equipment enhancement, alchemy (especially bomb-making) and sign-casting were wasted efforts.  Geralt would seem to become less responsive as well, even though this was neither a performance issue or a legitimate combat effect.  Fortunately, this is largely offset by the otherwise enjoyable combat, but save often to avoid major headaches.

As I understand it, a third game in the series is now in the works, but having just finished this one and having numerous other plot directions available - and many other games to play before then - I'll probably wait for The Witcher 3 to be offered in an Enhanced Edition as well.",A worthy successor to the epic original.,1372118400,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The demo has this awesome track, that I've yet to come across. I just keep hearing this song saying ""Here we go"", or ""Slave girl"" or something. It's basically getting old hearing the same songs, but I guess you could mute it.

  Other thing is that this game is nonstop. I usually push pause when I get tired. Then continue to beat my high score. The world block feature doesn't work for me for some reason. I thought maybe I was too late or something, but one time the world block wasn't erased and I still couldn't add my score. They should have made it easier to use that feature.

  Now that I think about it, I guess you can make your own playlist, but I just like playing the campaign. The more I play the better I get. I didn't mind the price, but I noticed that people are mentioning it. Yes, I also think it's high for what you get in the game. Frankly you're not getting a lot. But it's addictive, so you will spend hours playing it. If the song list was more random or just more entertaining this would be a five.","Addictive, but songs are getting old",1330732800,,,

4,True,"07 10, 2012",A2IYMICID58831,B006VB2UO6,Travis Chaffee,"The Madden and NCAA Football series have both been criticized for their lack of innovation upon release of the next iteration of the game for years now; NCAA Football 11 did some to change that perception, but NCAA Football 12 kept the same outward appearance, although it did change some gameplay features on the inside. In place of another major overhaul, however, NCAA 13 opted for some new features and animations, making the game more immersive than ever, but doing little to change the game's usual formula.

The new feature this year is Heisman challenge, a glorified Road to Glory mode that allows the player to step in to the shoes of a former Heisman Trophy winner such as Desmond Howard, Barry Sanders, or Charlie Ward, and compete in seasons on any team you wish. Inevitably this will lead to some disgusting combinations, such as Archie Griffin on Michigan or Carson Palmer on Notre Dame, but dwelling on that will only make matters worse. The Heisman Challenge's staple is reaction time, or bullet time, slowing down the game so the player can make cuts or throws with their head instead of quick reactions. In some cases, this is extremely helpful, but it also makes gameplay a little too easy at some levels. Heisman Challenge is definitely something to check out, but it won't keep you entertained for too long.

Dynasty has also seen some under the hood improvements. New recruiting options and features make each game in the season more important, as an underdog win over a top 25 opponent will net you some well-earned popularity with the recruits. This is a very welcome addition, and something which many have been wishing was part of the game for a while. More recruiting options are available for the player as well; Scouting is now an essential part of recruiting. You can see a player's ratings through the season, and target recruits based on your findings instead of being given a base grade. Calling recruits also leads to new gameplay options, and can help swing a recruit towards your school, if you're good enough. In game studio updates, provided by Rece Davis, improve the game's ESPN atmosphere, making it feel even more like you're watching the big game on television; the ESPN ticker gives you the scores from around the nation, and priority score alerts make it even easier to follow the big upsets of the heavy hitting game between top 5 teams.

Road to Glory saw some minor attention this year adding in new challenges as a college player. Despite the lack of a major overhaul it is still as fun as ever; leading your own high school player to the starting spot on a college team is extremely exciting. RTG may even be a little more difficult this year if you choose. It also touts the new reaction time used in the Heisman challenge, and contains better goals to pursue than past iterations, creating a more challenging game.

EA is touting the new animations that have been added to the game, with new receiving and throwing animations being brought into the game to improve realism, and motion blur being added as well. The new animations make the game more lifelike to be sure, and make the players look and feel more athletic, instead of moving about the field in a fashion similar to robots attempting to play American football. Motion blur never seems to be an integral part of the game, however, only popping up on replays and in between plays. Fans do have motion blur, but that seems less important than introducing motion blur in gameplay, and seeing a fan pump their fist with motion blur never made me gaze in wonder at the feat that EA achieved.  Defenses are not the omnipotent beasts they once were, and neither are receivers, for that matter. You need to make sure a receiver is looking for the ball before you throw to them, made easier by the grayed out icons that indicate your receiver is entirely oblivious to the fact you are attempting to throw them the ball. However, defensive players that aren't looking can't block the pass either, a problem that reoccurred throughout NCAA 12.

The biggest lacking feature for this year's NCAA football was the Infinity engine offered by Madden 13. Now, Madden 13 has not come out yet, and thus there has been no clear reference for its engine, giving us no clue whether it is another useless ""innovation"" provided by Madden or if it's actually a fantastic addition for the game, but it certainly is disappointing that it was not included in this year's NCAA. This is especially disappointing given that, at least in recent years, NCAA had surpassed Madden in being the elite football title produced by EA in terms of gameplay and reception.

The previous iteration of NCAA Football didn't do too much to separate itself from the line of other NCAA's, at least not in a manner similar to NCAA 11, and NCAA 13 doesn't do too much either.  For fans of college football and folks who have picked up each and every other game before it, it's a good buy, but for those simply looking for a recommendation to upgrade from NCAA 12, there's not much reason to spend the extra money for a the Heisman Challenge, new animations, and a roster update. As an individual who spent hundreds of hours on NCAA 12, I picked it up and loved it.

EDIT: I have recently had a lot of trouble loading my dynasty, as it constantly freezes during the game loading screen. I haven't been able to touch my dynasty mode after this, and it's extremely frustrating. Hopefully it will be patched soon, but as of now, with dynasty mode unable to be played correctly, I switch my position to don't buy.

And, after three days of playing Dark Souls 2, the verdict is in: DS2 is, in fact HARDER than the original Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. And it appears to be more fun too. But, again, harder doesn't not mean 'impossible' or 'unplayable'. It only means that planning, preparation and some practice involving a lot of dying is going to be part of your gaming experience. I will add some notes at the bottom of this review for anyone thinking to try DS2 but afraid of its impossible difficulty and for anyone who started to play the game and then abandoned it in frustration.

GAME SO FAR

To say that I'm impressed it would be an understatement. This third Souls title was not dumbed down or simplified in any significant way it seems. My first few hours were as good an experience as my first few hours of the first Dark Souls. Play is challenging and interesting in ways that got us to love Demon's Souls and Dark Souls in the first place. It's so... Dark Souls to experience the relief and joy of finally mastering the moves and tactics to beat your first significant enemy only...  to see yourself confronted by THREE of them around the next corner. In a few words, I love it.

Getting a little into details and still under first impressions, the game plays in many ways like its predecessors. Most controls will get your toon to do what you'd expect it but there are changes, some subtle, some more obvious. So, here's what I've noticed so far:

- Improved graphics: it's the first thing I noticed. Everything looks sharper, the color palette is a lot richer and... a couple NPCs actually move their lips while talking but that's only on cut scenes
- No frame rate issues yet but let's see how this holds true throughout the rest of the game
- New menus: everything appears to be better organized. But it's different from what we were used to so it will take a while
- New items, some quite interesting. One of the starting gifts would allow you to raise the difficulty level of a specific bone fire area with the corresponding increase in rewards.
- Non-boss enemies stop respawning after a while so you can't farm the same ones forever
- Fast travel from the beginning: can teleport to any bonfire once it's discovered or this was the case with the couple I've got to so far.
- More lore revealed explicitly but not a lot more at the very start of the game.
- Loose central hub concept: not quite the Demon's Souls Nexus but,so far, there's only one place to level up so it's a hub
- Hybrid healing: there is one Estus in the beginning but there are other healing items that heal in different ways. I expect to find some healing miracles as well at some point.
- Classes: wanderer, hunter, pyromancer and thief are gone. DS2 classes are warrior, knight, swordsman (dual wielding), bandit, cleric, sorcerer, explorer, and deprived
- Attributes: resistance is gone and won't be missed. Current attribute are adaptability, vigor, endurance, vitality, attunement, strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith
- Max health: decreases as you keep dying and is fully restored as you regain humanity. One of the starting gifts is a ring that will increase your max health points when worn, not unlike the Demon's Souls Cling ring
- Humanity: you no longer need to be at a fire to regain your humanity, not unlike old Demon's Souls.

I can't say much about invasions, covenants and co-op play yet because I didn't go through these yet but I will update my review once I do. I suppose everyone is busy with early progress in the game so there's not much time for messing up with other people's games yet but I'm sure this is going to change soon, probably within hours. I also have no comments on the bonus pack because I decided that I will not take advantage of it because I am after the full game experience, as hard as it may turn out to be.

IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DARK SOULS

First of all, don't worry about it. You do NOT need any Dark Souls experience in order to play Dark Souls 2 so... enjoy. However, if you get a hold of the old Dark Souls, give it a try because it's worth it. Try Demon's Souls too. It's a PS3 exclusive and can be had almost literally for pennies these days.

Also, do not believe anyone who claims that the Souls games are impossibly hard. They are not. I mean, they are difficult but not 'impossibly' so. Yes, they are different and to me they are unlike any other games but what that means is that patience, persistence and the willingness to learn from past mistakes will take you through the game because the game will make you get better every day while, true, quickly punishing you for your mistake or for getting too self-confident.

The Souls games are some of the most innovative releases in a long, long time. I don't remember being so wow'ed ever since playing Ultima II as a kid, back in the 80's (yes, I'm THAT old). My first time playing Demon's Souls after a long gaming hiatus triggered one 'aha' moment that hasn't left me as I completed it, then played it again then moved to Dark Souls when it was released and it's still there as I just started DS2 and I was still playing the old Dark Souls last night. There's so much to say about the Souls games but let me just mention some of the more innovative aspects:

- You are never alone, unless you play offline. You can see shadows or outlines of random other players as they progress through their world
- The 'blood stains' of players who died can hint at how they died as you can watch their last few seconds and  that can hint at how to deal with dangers ahead
- You have the ability to leave messages to no one in particular that will pop up in other players worlds and it's up to you whether they are going to be helpful or misleading or just cries of frustration
- Other players can come into your world uninvited and try to kill you
- You can summon other willing players to help defend against invaders or beat a boss
- Things that happen to you or things that you do in your world have consequences in other players' worlds and vice-versa
- You can join any of several covenants which grants you some benefits and may strengthen bonds with fellow covenant members
- Most lore is to be discovered through various hints during gameplay - you talk to NPCs, read weapons and armor descriptions
- 'Beating' the game is only the beginning or your journey. As soon are you 'finished' the NG+ (new game plus) starts which sets you back at the the beginning but with the benefits of acquired skills and capabilities and weapons and with much tougher enemies to confront. And then there's NG++ and so forth.

Add to the above a most excellent combat system that from what I see has gotten even better in DS2, the freedom to grow your character almost any way you choose, regardless of your initial class, the most impressive and detailed art displayed on landscapes, architecture, armor, weapons. And that's not all. It's not only other players coming into your game world or you visiting or invading theirs. It's also the game invading our day to day reality through the several Wiki sites and us, real world players taking organized expeditions to fight in organized tournaments or join in some predetermined role playing scenario. The possibilities are limitless and it explains why I've been playing these games for so many years already.

Enjoy. And don't let the inevitable setbacks discourage you.

RATING

I'm not going to go pro-reviewer style and assign scores to graphics, replay value and what not. Playing Dark Souls 2 is pure joy to me thus far and that translates into ""I love it"" which means '5 stars' and that's that.

NOTES ON PLAYING DS2

Yes, there is no 'easy mode' in DS2 but there are ways to survive even if your reflexes are not lightning fast. You will need some time and patience. So, here's what may help flattening the learning curve a little.

- Your initial class matters... initially. True, you can turn into whatever you want eventually, regardless of your starting class and there is one item that helps you rearrange your stats but if you started as a Warrior or Knight and can't make any progress, try a class that can do range attacks. Sorcerer is probably the best and you can develop your required sword-wielding stats as you level up and find some decent weapons too.
- Level up a little. The cost of leveling up is not that great in the beginning so if you identify some area where you can successfully deal with the enemies, clear it several times and use the souls gained to level up your favorite attribute such is INT if you go with Sorcerer.
- Bookmark the Wikis. There are several very good Wiki sites dedicated to the Souls games. They will eventually map the entire game, strategies, shortcuts and all. At this time you can learn a lot by lurking at the forums and don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people there are happy to help if they can.
- Get yourself the official&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Souls-II-Collector-s-Edition-Strategy-Guide/dp/0744015472/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Souls II Collector's Edition Strategy Guide</a>. It's been written by some of the better Dark Souls Youtube contributors and it's very detailed.
- Search Youtube for Dark Souls II videos that show you how to develop your character, where to go and what to do. EpicNameBro, ManufacturedOpinion, Lobos Jr, A German Spy are some of my favorite stars there and they all love Dark Souls.

You will find that, once you go past a sometime painful and frustrating beginning the games opens up and, while still frustrating and painful you will also begin to experience joy and pride in your accomplishments.

POST PLATINUM NOTES

I had a lot of fun taking the game through NG++ to earn the Platinum and I promptly started a new character after that but I am a little worried about the games Soul Memory implementation - gamers are matched in PvP based on the amount of souls they earned during their playthrough - because a certain 'cheat' site which hall remain unnamed allows gamers to basically have it all: weapons, armor, items by simply installing a fake 'save' onto their console. And, since Soul Memory maxes out at 15 million souls, gamers who actually earned their souls through play and reached, let's say, level 250, are now matched with those who did nothing but copy the cheat and reached level 500 or 600 or 700 with no effort on their part and, believe me, it's very, very hard to level up past 250 in a legitimate way.

For the first time, after playing Dark Souls and Demon's Souls for all these years, I am not often playing 'offline' because being invaded by super-high-level and practically indestructible characters that clearly cheated to get to that level is no fun and makes no sense whatsoever.

It would be nice if FROM rethought the Soul Memory feature because I have no problem with players at level 700 being PvP  matched against other players at a similar level, whether they earned it or not but I do see a huge problem when I'm invaded by someone with everything maxed out when it took me a couple hundred hours to reach a level one third that high and it would probably require thousands or tens of thousands of hours to hit the 'max' legitimately.",Death Won't Do Us Apart,1394496000,55,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

2,False,"09 20, 2013",A1TI39GE1KLXZC,B006ZPAYGE,ceigna,"Holy long review ahead!

My husband and I played this recently and we both think it's the worst of the LEGO titles we've played, and we both enjoyed the first Batman game.  While the standard story mode is still here, it's very short.  They also took out the ability to play story mode as the villains, which I thought made the first Batman game pretty fun.  The remainder 80% of the game is spent wandering around Gotham City, which they made too large.  If I wanted to wander in a vast environment, I'd play Assassin's Creed or similar ""adult"" games.  And probably the biggest problem with wandering around Gotham City is that none of the landmarks seem very exciting or distinct.  It's not like wandering around Middle Earth in the LEGO Lord of the Rings game where Hobbiton is very different from Moria.  Most of Gotham City seem unexcitingly similar to me.  I'll admit a large part of it is maybe because I'm a huge Lord of the Rings fan while I'm just kind of ambivalent to the DC universe.  But you know it's  a problem when it seems like it takes a lot longer to get from one end of Gotham to another than from Hobbiton to Mordor.

To compound the problem of the too-vast world, the character movements in this free mode are insane (in a bad way).  Holding down the analog, the character starts off at a normal pace.  Then within two seconds, the character speeds up in this difficult-to-control run made worse by the bad camera angle.  It's very difficult when there are fine movements involved in a jumping puzzle or you're trying to go in a straight line to collect coins.  The flying in the levels themselves aren't terrible.  Press a button to fly straight up and then move in the direction you want.  Flying in the open world of Gotham makes me want to throw my controller out the window because they made it totally different from flying in the levels!  There's now a target that you have to direct your character towards and you can't fly straight up or down.  And any time you jump off a building to fly, the camera angle changes drastically so it takes time to orient yourself.  It's made worse by the fact that the camera angle changes to zoom up on your character's ass when that happens.  Like, how are we supposed to see anything?  I probably wouldn't have been as annoyed if it wasn't so hard to get anywhere in Gotham City thanks to the insane controls.

The co-op split screen is also terrible.  I know an option is to not make it ""dynamic"" so that it doesn't crazily split the screen up.  But that in turn gives us two smaller screens that make it hard to see our environment in order to solve puzzles.  So on a ""dynamic"" split screen, the camera angles go all crazy sometimes when one of our characters is flying and the other is trying to aim the Batarang at a target.  I know the ""dynamic"" split screen has been around for several LEGO games already.  But I think this is the game that is really negatively impacted by the split screen because aiming with a weapon while another character is flying is used so much.  Also, I think the split screen in all the games take the fun out of playing co-op.  I remember in the first Indiana Jones game, it was so much fun because the two characters interacted and we could see what each other was doing during co-op.  With the ""dynamic"" split screen, it feels like we're playing two separate games at the same time.

In previous LEGO games, I've always wanted to and tried to go back and get as close to 100% completion as I can.  This is the only game in which I have very little desire to do so.  The huge Gotham City level is totally unappealing to me.  One can play as villains by finding them and beating them up.  That sounds interesting in theory.  Except all it takes to beat up a villain is three punches.  No, really!  Just walk up to Man-Bat and punch him three times and he's yours to play with.  It doesn't even take Superman's laser vision to kill him.  It's the same with all the villains in the Gotham world.  I thought at least they would be mini-levels, considering how short the actual levels were.  But nope.  Just three punches and you're done.

The only good thing about the game is that it left out the rage-inducing levitation puzzles from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.

I guess in conclusion, I just think LEGO is trying to do too much in this game.  Bring back the days when the LEGO characters spoke incoherently!  Bring back the days of a single screen in co-op (or at least use the split screen sparingly)!  Bring back the days of simple, fun puzzles because I don't want grappling hooks and electricity suits and green imagination bricks, etc.!  Bring back the days where 95% of the environment can be destroyed for no good reason!  I was really excited for the LEGO Marvel game, but I think now, I'm afraid I would dislike it as much as I dislike this game.

***Edited to add: as of 28% completion in this game, I'm officially giving up.  Running around the open world of Gotham City was just nauseating!  I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've had my share of games where the camera zooms and moves fairly fast and never had I felt anything that affected me like this game.  This is the only game in my 20+ years of gaming that made my feel like I was going to throw up.  First time, I thought I was just tired.  Second time was the last straw.  I seriously hope future LEGO games aren't like this!","Most ""blah"" LEGO game to date",1379635200,11,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

What you have here is of course the story play where you'll find mini-kits and collect bricks and of course the awesome freeplay mode. The story mode levels are gorgeous and huge as compared to other Lego story modes. But the biggest and coolest part of the game is just flying, and running through a huge beautiful layout of Gotham City, fly as Superman and Wonder Woman and Green Lantern above the buildings and run like a bullet through the streets as the Flash, the amount of hidden material in the city is huge and complex and will take up many summer hours.

I had been using a mini dual fan set up,in which I just stood the fans behind the system facing outwards. That worked o.k. but there was just a mess of cables,plus the dual fans didn't suck out that much air.
 The cooling station really works well. It pushes a lot of air through the fans. I received the system today,and put it to use. I played for 6 hours and the PS3 stayed a lot cooler than before. The ""power save"" setting kicks the fans on when the cooling systems sensor starts to warm up and also shuts off automatically when the PS3 cools down.
 The cooling station DOES NOT plug into the
PS3. Its a base that craddles the system,and allows all the vents to breathe along with the fans in the back sucking out the warm air.
 It does have 3 usb ports on the front,but since the cooling unit doesnt actually connect to the PS3,the usb ports are only good to charge things.
 The fans on the cooling system aren't too loud,you can hear them,but the noise isn't overpowering.
 I think this was a great purchase,maybe a little pricey,but it does its job.
Also,the smaller cooling systems that actually connect to the PS3 thru the usb ports,dont work. Theyre noisy and actually warm the PS3 up!!
 ++++UPDATE++++
Ive had the cooling system for about 10 days,and have played my PS3 every single day anywhere between 5 1/2 to 8 hours. The cooling system works great. Its worked without any problems. It turns on and shuts off just as advertised,and keeps the PS3 cool throughout my playing sessions. Im really glad I bought it. Ive tried other cooling fans,but they not only plugged into the PS3s usb ports-warming the console up,but the fans began getting really loud.

4,True,"02 8, 2016",A2AAQ4FI1YTUBE,B007CS9WYI,Calvin,"In The Box:
First off, the razer Tiamat 7.1 is a very well-made headset. It comes in a nice box with a magnetic latch and opening it was overall a great unboxing experience. It came with two side covers and a few cable accessories (to plug into the amp to switch it to speakers was the accessory and honestly I really like it because now I can use a simple button to switch between speakers and headset.) The headset does not have any adjusters but instead you just put it on your head and it's headband adjusts to your head for you. Saving you a lot of time. All the cables are braided and quite thick (because you are running 7 cables or more through it) There is an amplifier with a volume controller for all the speakers in the headset, a mute button, a speakers button, a 7.1 button, and a microphone button.

Comfort:
The headset is a little lighter than I thought it would be and has memoryfoam earcups. Because of this, they took around about an hour to get a bit uncomfortable. This is because the memoryfoam can feel a bit hard after a while. Other than that, the headband was nice a snug but sometimes moved around when my head did.

Sound Quality:
Upon further inspection of the headset (when I took the ear pads off) It seemed that there ARE 5 speakers in each ear cup as advertised, but, some of them are actually of quite low quality. This is because razer can't afford to put 5 high-quality drivers in each ear cup because that would be too expensive for the consumer. Honestly though, this does affect the surround sound quality by making it a bit harder to differentiate between speaker channels (specifically rear channels) but other than that it doesn't sound too bad. Although I do have to note that the bass in stereo mode is a bit overwhelming because they are driving too much power to the subwoofer in that mode and then the subwoofer can barely be heard in 7.1 mode because it doesn't have enough power.

Conclusion:
Honestly, if you have a really good sound card and want amazing 7.1 sound quality from a headset, this will do the job. But if you don't have an amazing sound card and have a bit of extra cash, then try getting a 3D surround sound headset. Because they only have one speaker, the sound is usually higher quality, and most 3D surround sound headsets are wireless. I would personally recommend the Recon 3D from creative or even the FREQ 9 from madcatz.","Not A Bad Headset, but for the price I would have rather gotten a ""3D surround sound"" headset",1454889600,,,

I always found my old keyboard had way too many ""gamer"" buttons to the left.  So much so, My keyboard tray could barely hold it.  I wanted to find a good mechanical keyboard that wasn't too loud.  I heard MX Brown Switches are the best in that regard. I also wanted USB ports and an audio passthrough would be a bonus.  I have grown accustom to backlit, so it needed that as well.

Pros:
-Solid weight, doesn't seem fragile in the slightest.
- Braided cable works almost too well (still stiff and hard to conform)
-Two USB passthroughs
-Audio passthrough
-Cool Design
-Types really well.

Neutrals
-Coming from a membrane keyboard it still seems really loud.  Some keys more than others. (mostly left hand and spacebar).
-It seems offcenter to how I type.  Not sure if this is because old keyboard was more centered or what.  This one is hard to describe.

Con:
-Windows Key is on the left, so I have to use two hands to do a Windows+L to lock my PC
- Function key is on the lower right, which causes two hands to be needed to adjust media keys.
-Audio passthrough location means the headphone wire dangles on your hand.

Like it's prequel, 9 hours, 9 persons, 9 doors, this game excels not only in it's novel portions, but also it's gameplay portions as well. The gameplay consists of detective style puzzles that require deep thought and outside the box thinking. I have played this game for hours nonstop and have enjoyed every second of it. The story is deep, rich and engaging with many Mind Blowing plot twists and turns . The thing that makes this game a little better than the prequel is the fact that the game has full English and Japanese voice acting. Not only that, it also gives you a flowchart listing all the paths you take, which comes in real handy to skip the portions you've seen before while getting other endings.

There is really just one ""true"" ending, but in order to get that true ending you have to unlock all the other ""endings"".

If you like multiplayer and this scenario appeals to you, by all means pick this game up.  All I can say is it is incredibly frustrating and there have been many times I wanted to throw my controller through the screen.  I don't know why I am punished for having a good internet connection but I am not buying the next one if this trash continues.  It's a shame really because they added some things I really like, namely the point system and pick ten system.

I just finished the single player campaign and it was merely ok.  I think after all of the CoDs I have played nothing in the single player can really WOW me anymore.  Weird pace, past and future switching is annoying, and each level was kind of boring.  They do try to change up the pace with the strikeforce missions but they were kind of bland.  The challenged\s however added some flavor to the single player in trying to complete them.  Being able to pick out your load out on single player is pretty cool too.

For zombies, I was never good at it as I spend a majority of my time in multiplayer so I can't give an expert opinion if it is better or worse than past iterations.  I do know that waiting for the bus, the random fire on the floor, and the little mist imps are annoying, not innovative.

All in all this gets one star for some seriously screwed up things but I added one for the things they did right.  The real story here is that the franchise keeps moving in the wrong direction.

1) Bad placement of rubber pads on side. Some are crooked and peel back when you use the mouse.
2) Sticky buttons. A couple I purchased had sticky buttons.

Also there is a longer term, fatal flaw I have noted with SOME manufacturing runs of this mouse.. (so far only 2 of them out of 10 I have bought) After long term use your thumb heats up the side pad, causing the sticky part of the rubber to heat up, and lose it's grip. Once this happens the rubber grip on the side of the mouse will never stay in place again. This has happened on 3 of these in a row, and appears to be a terrible design flaw.  Granted, it can take a few months for this to happen, and repeated heating to wear it down, but as long as you understand this flaw, and can handle it, then this is a good mouse.

That aside, this mouse is flat out amazing, especially for the price. I knew this mouse was too good to continue so I have been watching for it to go discontinued - which all good, low cost products do and presto.. This week it went discontinued and supplies are drying up and prices are RISING.

The game environment is gorgeous, but that is really the only thing that stands out. The rest of the game play is vanilla and forgettable.

The story doesn't draw you in, the world is forgettable to the extent that it is easy to get lost since the scenery is repetitive. Your character is mute, so the cut scenes are one way conversations, with really bad syncing with the NPC mouth movements. It just seems that Square Enix didn't even try on this one.

My only real complaint is that the colors are locked to the DPI settings. Basically, there are 4 different DPI presets that can be adjusted and switched to with a press of a button on the mouse. Problem is, each setting has a color that goes along with it. This means that when you change to a different DPI preset, it changes the color of the mouse.

Pros:
[+] They of course work with both Wii and Wii U systems
[+] They include the Wii Motion Plus built-in without requiring the separate bulky adapter. Many newer games require this feature and won't work with the old Wii remotes (this was a huge selling point to me as those Motion Plus adapters looked ridiculous. I ended up selling mine and replaced them with these)
[+] Sync button is accessible without removing the battery case! This was a huge design blunder of the original Wiimotes. Especially when you have your remotes in silicone sleeves; syncing/resyncing controllers was a pain. Now you can sync them without removing the battery cover.
[+] The theming is brilliantly executed. The colors perfectly match Mario/Luigi/Peach's wardrobes. The + and - buttons are gold/yellow like the buttons on their overalls, the red/green matches their shirts, and the back blue part matches their overalls. The 1 & 2 buttons are a nice-looking brown instead of plain black. They even color matched the included silicone sleeves and wrist straps! Everything about them feels extremely high quality.

Cons:
[-] Really can't think of any! They designed these very well. Perhaps my only suggestion would be to revise them in a way to improve battery life a bit? But that probably won't happen any time soon.

Other:
[*] Google the Yoshi version they have in Japan! It might even be my favorite. It's a shame they haven't released it in the U.S. But maybe some day?
[*] Hey, while we're at it, why not release a Toad/Daisy/Rosalina version since they are all playable characters in Super Mario 3D world?

The horrid deadzone on all the third party controllers forced me to stick with the DS3.  When I saw this controller I was turned off by the wire only option, but I read that they finally perfected the complicated science of the deadzone.  I figured I can get over the long thick wire attached to the thing as long as it emulated the xbox experience on my ps3.

Here comes the ultimate blow to this controller.  There is no ability to swap R1 with R2 and L1 with L2.  It's baffling that they didn't switch the buttons by default since every single PS3 game in the world defaults its trigger buttons to L1 and R1.  Surely this can be solved by going to options and doing it manually, right?  Wrong.  Uncharted 3, Battlefield 3, Ghost Recon Future Soldier, and Resident Evil 6 are just a few of the titles I played that don't have this in their options.  So you have this xbox style controller, but you are forced to use R1 and L1 instead of the fancy triggers.  I emailed Power A about a possible firmware update, and their response was that implementing a trigger swap feature is too advanced for their technological capabilities.  Funny, because the Gioteck HF-2 can do it though that is another failed controller with a broken deadzone.  Steer clear of this crap.  It's not worth the price or the time.

4,False,"12 20, 2012",A3RFCBJ6U5DLFN,B009AGXH64,MisterMusicFan,"My friends and I eagerly awaited the launch of Nintendo's Wii U in November, and were quite anxious to see what new innovations (and fun) the console would have to offer. After spending more than a solid month with my Wii U, I feel confident in my ability to assess and discuss what it brings to the table, with an understanding that it is a console still in its infancy whose limits don't seem to have been pushed just yet. This doesn't stop it from being a great new system more or less worthy of this new generation, but it does certainly come with its fair share of setbacks, some of which will hopefully be patched up in updates to come.

We'll get started with the specs; the processor is an IBM Power multi-core, alongside an AMD Radeon-based High Definition GPU. That's right, at long last, Nintendo has gone full HD, meaning we'll now be able to enjoy the likes of Mario and Zelda in glorious 1080p. The games and menus look crisp and razor-sharp so long as you have a TV display that can accommodate; this was definitely a boost the previous Wii was in serious need of. All Wii U consoles come prepackaged with an HDMI cable, but if you do not own an HD-compatible television, you'll have to purchase the standard definition AVI cord separately (or use the same cord from the original Wii). The Wii U is powered by a tri-core PowerPC-based CPU, clocking in at an average 1.24 GHz (one trait in which in falls behind its previous-generation competitors, at less than half the speeds of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, although the Wii U does offer twice the amount of RAM of either of those consoles, which helps cushion the difference). As for storage space, the Basic Set comes with 8 GB while the Deluxe Set has 32 GB; neither is spectacularly impressive and pale in comparison to what the Xbox and PlayStation offer storage-wise, but you can drastically increase this amount of space with an SD card and/or external hard drive, and this won't really be a concern at all for those disinterested in downloadable content/games. For those disinterested in the technical mumbo-jumbo, however, your heart's in the right place, because this console's tech specs take a serious backseat to its innovative new gaming experiences.

As most of you surely already know, Nintendo's latest home console novelty is the addition of the Nintendo GamePad, which comes prepackaged with each and every Wii U console. The GamePad is, as its name insinuates, a tablet controller featuring a touchscreen display (of about 6.2'') surrounded by two analog joysticks (on each side of the screen), a classic D-Pad and diamond configuration face buttons. There are also two triggers behind each respective upper end of the pad, as well as a front-facing camera (used for taking pictures and/or video chat). The GamePad inherits the Wii Remote's Home Button at its bottom center, allowing you to return to the main menu at (mostly) any given time, and a Power Button that can again be used to turn on both the GamePad itself and the entire console. The GamePad is glossed with a smooth, white or black finish, depending on whether you purchase the Basic or Deluxe Set (more on that later).

In and of itself, the GamePad is pretty nice; its resolution is only 158ppi, about the same as the first iPhone (so to answer one immediate question some may have, no, the GamePad's screen is not HD), but it utilizes this display pretty impressively, as most games, menus and webpages still look clean, polished and colorful. It is also impressively comfortable to hold; despite its at-first-glance size, it is extremely lightweight (lighter than most iPads) and easy to hold with its well-designed grips. Unfortunately, however, only time will tell how durable the thing is-it doesn't necessarily strike me as extremely fragile, but shake the GamePad and you'll hear the joysticks and face buttons rattle. My GamePad suffered a nasty drop recently (it was quite literally flung onto a tile floor), and although it still works perfectly fine, the black finish near the bottom was noticeably scuffed, although I will say in this instance the color worked out in my favor-the damage isn't visible at all from afar. As with most items of consumer electronics, particularly those likely to be (man)handled by young children, a protective case may be worth serious consideration. Like most handheld devices, the GamePad has a rechargeable battery that you can power up with the prepackaged GamePad charger (despite what it looks like, it is not the same as the 3DS charger, the two are not interchangeable). Obnoxiously, the GamePad has a very weak battery life and will in fact sometimes have to be charged after a measly two to three hours of use, depending on what you're using it for. This can be particularly frustrating given that you can't charge it from the Wii U console and must instead free up an entirely separate outlet for it. For this reason, if you use the Wii U moderately often you'll be best off leaving the GamePad on a charging cradle in moments you're not using it unless you want it constantly dying on you. I'm hoping that future accessories or attachments, like the upcoming Nyko UBoost, help remedy this issue.

One of the key features of the Wii U is its interaction with the GamePad and how what you or other players see on the GamePad will differ from what's displayed on the TV; the pad will be used in a variety of different ways depending on the game you're playing or menu you're navigating. In certain Nintendo Land games, for example, the GamePad will be used as an entirely separate screen in multiplayer modes, allowing one player to see things that others cannot, making for very exciting challenges and surprises. Certain touchscreen swipes on the GamePad can affect what appears on the TV screen, and in certain games you'll even be able to aim the GamePad like a weapon to launch projectiles onto the TV screen. There is also of course the awesome option of remote play, which will allow you to (so long as the game/software you're playing permits it) play an entire console game directly from the GamePad itself, completely freeing up the TV for alternative use. This is one of the Wii U's greatest attributes in that it effectively becomes a home and handheld console all-in-one, which will prove particularly useful for parents who don't want the TV constantly clogged up for gaming use or people who relish the thought of playing console games in bed. One unfortunate limitation, however, is the fact that the GamePad must be within proximity of the Wii U console in order to function; this means you'll likely have trouble using the GamePad upstairs if the console is downstairs, and certainly won't be able to leave the house with it.

Another great function is the TV Remote, which allows you to control your entire TV directly from the GamePad-you can turn your TV on/off, change the channel/volume, or even screen input from the controller's touchscreen. I'm not positive this feature is compatible with all models of TVs, but it's a fantastic option to have, allowing you to set up everything with nothing but the GamePad in hand. The Wii U also offers a web browser, which allows the option of mirroring the GamePad screen to the TV (so you can view webpages on your HD flatscreen while navigating from the GamePad's touchscreen) or format the settings so that webpages will only display on the GamePad itself. The web browser is fast and reliable, but like most products of this type, it isn't compatible with Flash, so don't plan on watching many videos through the web browsing app.

Thankfully, however, this won't be too much of a concern, as the Wii U is the first Nintendo home console to offer a fully expansive app store and online user network. This comes in the form of the Nintendo eShop, modeled closely after its 3DS counterpart. You will now be able to download apps that allow the use of YouTube, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Instant Video, downloadable mini-games or even entire retail games, directly from your Wii U console. This brings the Wii U a big step closer to being a multi-use gaming system, like its competitors, although it unfortunately still cannot play DVDs or Blu-rays (most likely due to licensing issues with Sony, whom technically owns the Blu-ray format). This new eShop also comes with the Nintendo Network and Miiverse, a massive online user base through which you can finally tie a personal account to your Nintendo console and accompanying games. This account can be synched with Club Nintendo (Nintendo's rewards program), used to purchase downloadable games, apps and other content, and interact with other players all over the world on Miiverse.

A very intuitive and unique addition to Nintendo and the gaming world in general, Miiverse is something of a game-centric social network (imagine Facebook, Twitter, deviantArt and the Nintendo section of IGN all rolled into one) in which Wii U owners all over the world can communicate with one another through a series of messages and pictures. There are separate threads for each respective game release, and because the network is so frequently trafficked, chances are you can find out how to beat that one pesky level within a matter of minutes, particularly if the game is a popular one. You can post short messages (whether they be exclamations, complaints or questions) or draw pictures (on the GamePad touchscreen); the core addictiveness of the feature is that it's quite entertaining to browse through the posts, as many of them are quite hilarious and you'll come across some shockingly impressive artwork. For parents or other users paranoid about obscenity or other general inappropriateness, Miiverse is shockingly void of the spiteful trolls and putrid hate-spew that plague a vast majority of online networks, thanks primarily to on-par administrator monitoring; any and all posts that can be interpreted as hateful or obscene will be promptly removed. For those ready to bemoan excessive censorship, it's actually a very welcome addition and makes for an unexpectedly pleasant community; your post won't get removed for saying the new Mario game sucks, but it will get removed for displaying an image of Mario teabagging Peach or calling the user below you a four-letter word. Rational users should find the whole thing to be a breath of fresh air, especially in an online environment-gasp-common decency, what a concept. Better yet, Miiverse can be accessed from the GamePad without interrupting your game, so you can hop on to get a quick question answered mid-game and then hop right back without missing a beat.

As for the main menu and interface itself, the Wii U's menus are modeled after those already made familiar on the previous Wii and 3DS; you'll be able to scroll through a menu of panels (""channels"") on the GamePad to select which game, software, app or setting you'd like to open; the setup is once again pretty clean and user-friendly. There's also an all-new main menu view, which incorporates Miiverse and online connectivity; in this option, you'll be able to view trending community topics in real time as several Miis from all over the world enter your ""WaraWara Plaza"" (as it's called). You can browse through things people are saying (and drawing) all over Miiverse, with a focus on games you own/have played recently. This is an awesome way to cruise through what's up with other community members, and you can tap on a post from the GamePad (you can swap menu views between the GamePad and TV, viewing WaraWara Plaza from one and the classic channel menu from the other) to see its details.

The Wii U is also completely backwards-compatible with all Wii games; whether it's The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword or Wii Sports, you will be able to play it on your Wii U. Keep in mind, however, that the Wii U does NOT offer GameCube controller (or game) compatibility, so you'll have to turn to Wii Remotes or Classic Controllers for Mario Kart Wii or Super Smash Bros. Brawl. For those who previously owned a Wii, you will be able to transfer virtually all of your previous console's data onto your Wii U, including Virtual Console software, save data, apps, and other information. In order to do so, however, you'll need an SD card with at least 512 MB of free space and a little less than an hour or so of free time, depending on how much data you've accumulated. The process is relatively painless once you know how to do it (you can find the step-by-step process via the System Transfer app in the console itself or just about anywhere online), and comes with probably the most adorable system transfer cutscene ever. Keep in mind that once you transfer the data, it is impossible to transfer back, and your old Wii will be wiped clean. In a questionable move, Nintendo made the Wii U's ""Wii Mode"" completely separate from the primary menu; you'll have to deactivate the core home screen to switch over to Wii Mode (in which you'll shift to the old Wii home screen, same as it ever was) if you want to play any Wii games or old software. This is a bit annoying that it couldn't have just been incorporated into the new interface, but perhaps it will change with a future update.

A word of caution to parents buying for young (i.e. particularly impatient) children: the console, as of right now, requires a day-one system update in which you will have to connect to the Internet and update the operating system before the console will be useable at all. Regrettably, the process will take about an hour depending on your connection strength; for this reason, you might want to consider taking it out of the box early and getting the update over with yourself before handing it over as a gift. This ties into another recurring issue: the loading times. While this is something that could theoretically be improved with beefier servers and/or system updates, as of right now the Wii U seems to be plagued with noticeably unfavorable loading times; depending on the time of day and/or connection strength, you will sometimes have to wait several moments before the home menu, Miiverse, or game you're playing finally load, and there's absolutely nothing you can do during this time. There is no progress bar on most of these screens and at its worst it will leave players impatient and frustrated. This is an issue that seems to have lessened with a recent system update and I'm hoping continues to do so, since at their best the web browser and other screens can load quite quickly; here's hoping this is progressively repairable.

As many already know, the Wii U is currently available in two separate versions: the Basic and Deluxe Sets, respectively. The Basic Set comes with the console itself, a GamePad, HDMI cable, and sensor bar. The Basic Set Wii U console comes with 8 GB of storage space (very, very little, but enough to get by if you're not huge on downloadable content/games). The Basic Set is currently priced at $299.99. The Deluxe Set comes with all that plus the Nintendo Land game, GamePad stand and charging cradle, console stand and the Deluxe Digital Promotion (which offers 10% back in Nintento Points on games and content downloaded on the Nintendo eShop). The Deluxe console also offers 32 GB of storage space, more than three times that of the Basic. At only $50 more than its Basic counterpart, the Deluxe Set is definitely the way to go. As of right now, all Basic Sets are white and all Deluxe Sets are black, so this may cause issues for some who want the features of one but the color of another, although keep in mind the Basic Set's storage space can be expanded with an external hard drive and the accessories can be purchased separately.

All in all, the Wii U is full of awesome ideas and potential, much of which hasn't been fully utilized or properly executed just yet. It has its fair share of setbacks, the most glaring of which are the loading times, weak GamePad battery life and general lack of fully fleshed out features for the ""hardcore"" audience (games with online multiplayer, seamless voice chat, an easier/faster way to communicate with other gamers or invite them to join you in a game). As previously mentioned, however, this is clearly a console in its infancy and I'm confident the best is yet to come. Regardless of its setbacks, most early users will find themselves swept into a honeymoon period love affair, as the GamePad functionality and other addictive features are fun, intuitive and user-friendly. Although Sony and Microsoft's next offerings will surely push more along the lines of sheer horsepower, if you're looking for intuitive, innovative new ways to game and excited to see where the classic Nintendo IPs will head next in this new era, the Wii U is the way to go. As soon as the big first-party games start coming out, it's likely to become a solid must-have.",A console with plenty of promise,1355961600,4,,

5,False,"06 13, 2014",A22UW60T9HWOKW,B009B1D7JK,apeman505,"When I first heard of Monster Hunter, it was back in 2007 when I saw the original PS2 game in Electronics Boutique and thought to myself, ""Monter Hunter?! That sounds like an awful Cabela's/Pokemon rip-off!"" Then I looked at the cover and saw a barbarian decked out in dragonskin armor fighting an enormous dragon-saurus with a 10-foot long sword made from a dragon jawbone and nearly passed out from overexposure to awesomeness. I bought the game, and now it's seven years later and I've played every iteration of the game since then on almost a daily basis. Monster Hunter is AWESOME.

So anyway, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the latest game in the series, and is available for both the WiiU and the 3DS. If you have both copies, you can transfer your save file between the two systems wirelessly, which is an awesome feature although you need to download a (free) utility to do so. The WiiU version allows you to play with other WiiU's online, as well as with 3DS's in the same room. The 3DS version unfortunately doesn't allow you to play with other people online unless you also have a WiiU.

At its heart, the Monster Hunter series are hack-and-slash action RPGs that are most often compared to Phantasy Star Online. In most quests you are tasked with killing or capturing a very large monster within the time limit, although there are also quests where you hunt smaller monsters, steal dragon eggs, or gather materials from the environment. You are able to ""carve"" any of the monsters you kill in the games to obtain materials (raw meat, bones, claws, etc.), as well as mine for ores, catch bugs/fish, and gather miscellaneous stuff off the ground. Between quests you use these materials to make weapons, armor, and consumable items. It's really awesome and satisfying to wear the skins of all the dragons you've killed, or to make a giant hammer out of a huge dragon skull!

Although there are Hunting Ranks in Monster Hunter, there is no leveling system. All character progression is made by upgrading your equipment, which is quite addictive because all the weapons and armor are awesome to look at, and each one can turn into a long chain of different weapons by upgrading it multiple times.

In the original Monster Hunter game, there were  7 weapon classes: Greatswords, Hammers, Lances, Sword 'n' Shields, Dual Swords, Light Bowguns, and Heavy Bowguns. Roughly 10 years later there are now 12 weapon classes, with the addition of Switch Axes, Gunlances, Bow & Arrows, Longswords (Katanas), and Hunting Horns. Each weapon class is vastly different in its fighting style, and Capcom has done a great job in making each one a lot of fun to use. Although each weapon class is well balanced against the rest of the classes, certain weapons have different uses--you can smash the head crest off the Barroth with a hammer, but you'll need a blade to cut off the tail.

The smaller weapons allow you to run about and attack quickly, whereas the larger weapons deal more damage but are much slower. This is the basis on what makes the Monster Hunter games fun--you really have to budget your attacks to make sure you also have time to dodge the monsters' attacks, and boy do the monsters hit hard! Much of the skill involved in playing Monster Hunter comes from studying the monsters' movements and learning when to attack and when to dodge. Each one is almost like a puzzle, and you get the same satisfaction from figuring them out.

To further complicate things, there are elemental and status attacks as well. For instance, weapons made from fire dragons usually deal fire damage, whereas armor made from their hides will resist it but share the elemental weaknesses of the monster they came from. FURTHERMORE, by combining different pieces of armor you can unlock skills and abilities that can greatly affect your fighting abilities, and you can even modify individual armor pieces to further tweak everything. It's a very robust and yet intuitive system.

Then there are the monsters themselves--they're magnificent to behold. The designers at Capcom always do their best to really make each monster seem like a real live animal, albeit of dinosaurian proportions and with extraordinary powers. When not attacking you, the monsters can be seen going about their daily lives and doing monster things. It really feels believable when they spot you and you can just imagine them thinking, ""Hey, what are you doing in MY territory?! You'd better get out now!""

The monsters are also extremely powerful. Just by roaring, most monsters will cause your character to involuntarily stop and plug his ears (unless your armor has hearing protection), and a flap from their wings is enough to blow you backwards or even knock you down. This adds realism to the game but can be frustrating because you can often get yourself killed while your character was caught off balance. It also adds challenge to the game, but I can't say the game is ever unfair or cheap--it's more like the game is penalizing you for being in the wrong place at the wrong time by taking control away for a second.

All in all, this game is amazing but it's definitely not for everyone. Although the previous Monster Hunter games had a very steep learning curve that kept it from gaining popularity in the states, MH3U does its best to welcome beginners while providing enough late-game challenges appropriate for veterans. This comes at the cost of a rather lengthy series of (unskippable) tutorial quests at the beginning of the game. Furthermore, the game can become repetitive because the quest rewards are randomized, and this can result in grinding for certain materials (RATHALOS PLATES). This is made worse by the fact that the monsters in the game take quite a long time to kill (quests last up to 50 minutes). Even so, I find the difficulty and persistence needed to succeed immensely satisfying, making it my all-time favorite. Five Stars.",My all-time favorite game,1402617600,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Numerous times my sound would cut out in mid game, but would come back after the level was over...Also, many fun aspects of the game are missing from some of the games as well..A few good examples are:

In Pitfighter, your opponent doesn't taunt you and in Rampage, it is impossible to change your character if you continue the game after being killed. The achievements are also insanely easy to get.

Also, it can be very hard at times with certain games to adapt to the 360 controller as far as general flow of the game.

* I'm looking forward to playing the game again on a higher difficulty. There's many character relationships I look forward to pursuing.

Cons:
* Because perma-death is optional you get the feeling while playing that the experience isn't tailored to it being optional. I ended up with way more characters.than I could put to use and there was no incentive to let my lower level characters grind up.
* Skill unlocks were opaque to me so I had difficulty planning my characters' progression.

It actually feels a lot better than the 12,000 DPI Logitech G502, where the 12,000 doesn't seem to completely translate to what you see on the screen (the 8,000 something DPI of this mouse looks faster on screen). The mouse also feels extremely durable and well built, no rattling or creaking whatsoever.

That said, all the buttons on this mouse require effort to press down (even the left and right click). The sniper button requires serious, firm pressure to click, which makes it difficult to hold your aim steady when shooting. The clickers aren't as bad but require pressing instead of tapping, which would be a pain in an FPS. It's because of this that I don't think it's a very good gaming mouse, despite the excellent tracking.

Also, the mouse is large in size but meant for small hands, based on the layout of where your thumb is supposed to be and the ergonomics of it. Right now, to have my fingertips on the clickers , my thumb cannot reach the sniper button comfortably (because it's so far back due to finger length) and I cannot rest my palm on it at all (I'm 6'1"").

The rest of the review is for the multiplayer but I gave the campaign a try and here's my review.
So far iv really been enjoying the campaign. I hated gears 3 story, didn't find it interesting at all but something is different in this one.
For some reason almost everything missing from multiplayer is in the single player.
You can tag walls with grenades, execute locust, damage boost from drive reload which is all great and I hope they add this stuff back online.
So far iv played a few missions and for the most part iv liked them, but they are very very repedative. It seems they have added a horde type segment to each mission where you have to hold off the locust for a few waves which brings back good memories.
I also very much like these declassified missions which are a extra challenge to each extra xp, for example can only use pistoles, or the map is filled with smoke and you can't see well.
Another thing I like is the voice acting. It reminds me of max Payne 3 for some reason. How your playing and you character is taking in the background. The whole story is kind of weird and cool. Your playing memories and telling the leader of the cog what you did during your mission Ina court since your team disobeyed orders or something. It's new, and and I like how different missions you play as different characters which give a cool insight to your squad.
Overall it's really good and I like it a lot. Took me 6-8 hours to beat(can't really remember exact time)

-Aftermath review-
Anyone who doesn't know aftermath is an additional mission that takes place during gears of war 3. Sounds great, but it doesn't feel like gears 3. New weapons and enemies that are in judgment campaign are in aftermath which is really stupid. But you will see some old locust though. Well after math isn't long, took me about an hour to beat,

-Multiplayer review-
I have been really excited for this game for a while. I loved gears 2 and 3 but this game isn't the same at all.
I guess epic thought since it was a prequel you can take out basically everything that gears is and restart. Well that doesn't work
First I will list what they took out or changed from gears 3.

-active reloads no longer give your bullets more damage if you hit it at the right time-
this was a great thing in the gears franchise. I loved active reload. It was unlike anything in any other games so why take it out?

-no more rifle-shotgun duo-
maybe this is for the better but I don't know. I did like having a shotgun and a rifle in the same set up. When your far away use a rifle, when your up close whip out the shotty but it was overpowered. I won't ever use a shotty anymore

-limited character selection-
You start off with 4 characters to use online, and can only unlock 5 others! So only 9 fricken characters to choose from?

-spawn with frag grenades-
This isn't call of duty! You shouldn't spawn with frags!

-maps are so congested and small now-
I loved the style of gears 3 maps but these maps are not good. Way too many narrow hallways and alleys.
Also there's a map where you fly around the map in a fricken helicopter shooting a mini gun. Who thought this was a good idea?

-no more reviving team mates-
Yup, you no longer fall to the ground and bleed out or get revived. You die automatically.

-only three fricken game modes and four maps!
Team deathmatch, domination and deathmatch and 4 multiplayer maps! That's it! What the heck!

-no more sticking grenades to walls-
Why take this out? I used to get tons of kills with doing this.

-Environment weapons are overpowered-
Can use rifles and shotguns while hiding behind boom shields? Please tell me how that's fair?

-no more locust vs humans-
Why? Just why? I don't want to kill humans. The whole gears of war franchise is based on gears vs locust!!

-it's nothing new-
Besides a few new guns, there's really nothing new at all. Heck even the fricken menu layout is exactly the same, the awards and ribbon system is exactly the same as well.

To me it feels like epic doesn't care what gears fans like or wanted. It really feels like they wanted to please call of duty fans, and make it more like cod. It's sad to say but it's true.

Graphics-8/10
Some people say it looks a ton better than gears3 but it really doesn't.
Gameplay-7.5
They changed gears so much that it doesn't play like gears any more,
Sound-7.5/10
Everything sounds exactly the same as gears 3.
Multiplayer-6/19
Limited modes and reduced functions make online a lot less fun and competitive like older gears were.
Campaign-8/10
Maybe the saving grace of the game. I really loved it and thought it was special.
Overall-6
Its just not true to its roots. It's just plain boring and it already feels old since there's only 4 maps online, and all the features we have come to love are all missing","Fun campaign, bad online",1364515200,10,,

If you have small hands then this one may feel a bit clunky and cumbersome.  I have long fingers so the added girth of the handles was perfect whereas the PS3 controller always felt a bit petite.  Charge time was rather quick at 3 hours but don't expect to play while being connected because the supplied cord is just too short!  I was ready to come on here and bash this equipment because for the first couple of times playing it felt as if the controller was unresponsive or lagging.  We made sure to fully charge and it happened again.  Now it doesn't seem to have that issue any longer.  I wish I could give a reason for the change.  If the issue does arise again, then I will update my review and star rating to reflect that.

Another minor issue is that the HOME button no longer turns the system on.  Not a major issue but one to point out.

- tactile feed back because of the mechanical keys. Always great to go mechanical
- Easy to maneuver through razer synapse 2.0 and customize each individual key
- great customization when it comes to ergonomics. you can adjust the thumb area, and the top/bottom palm rest.
- I would say any hand, unless you have freakishly large hands, would be able to utilize this product

Cons:
- the 12345 top row keys are higher than the average keyboard, so they're a bit harder to reach. you might say why don't I try and customize them. Well, I tried by putting the WASD keys a row lower than where they are and then moved the 12345 keys down a row, but it felt really uncomfortable because my fingers were crammed at the bottom. This is just me mind you, it can totally work out for you.
- it takes a while to adjust to the entire format of keypad (finger positioning, etc)
- The 8 way macro key on the thumb rest part is extremely sensitive when you're using all 8, and sometimes it's hard to hit the exact number because the circle is so tiny, so you may hit the wrong number. I am using 4 as of right now, and it seems to be doing just fine with BF4.

As easy as it gets,just plug the 3.5mm headset and mic jacks into your pc,change a few sound settings in the os and it's ready to go. No software to install.

Comfort
This has to be the most comfortable headset i have ever used. The large space for your ears surrounded by soft foam makes these a pleasure to use. I was wearing them all day long when i first got them and did not experience any discomfort. The earpieces swivel and the plastic frame can be extended to fit anyones head.

Very good. The bass is so deep,so rich but the higher tones are lacking. When listening to a band like Metallica i found myself having to increase the volume almost all the way up to really hear the higher tones such as from a guitar.

The only negative aspect of this product is the microphone. It is not horrible by any means but i found myself having to move the mic right onto my lips for people to hear me correctly. With my old Logitech headset that i have been using for years the mic is 3 inches away from my lips and my voice is picked up loud & clear but with this units mic 3 inches away it sounds as if i am very distant. No matter the settings i used this mic had to be pretty much touching my lips for it to pick my voice up. I look forward to what others have to say so i can find out if i am the only one having this mic issue. Perhaps mine is simply defective?

When i have the microphone right against my lips people can hear me so i have tried to look past this annoying issue. The sound quality and comfort are the reason i will be using this headset for a long time.",The most comfortable headset i have ever used,1370044800,,{'Style:': ' G230 Stereo'},

3,False,"08 25, 2014",A3NVNRFVGHOWHU,B00BGAA0SU,Philip Norsworthy,"Although I've always felt that the original Infamous games were overrated, I liked them enough that I wanted to give Second Son a try. Despite getting mostly positive reviews, it seems that the game hasn't made same impact as the original games did. After playing the game, I think I can imagine why.

The game's strong suit is the graphics. The various powers loook incredible, and the new environmental physics are great. What's particularly satisfying is that a lot of stuff that you destroy stays destroyed, which makes fighting the game's enemies more satisfying. Taking the time to destroy their structures really makes it feel like you're freeing the city from the oppressive government forces.

The new protagonist Delsin Rowe is a big improvement over Cole Macgrath. He has a far more vibrant personality with a lot of funny lines, and I personally felt there were a couple of subtle nuances to his character that I thought made him interesting. His relationship with his brother Reggie is the strongest part of the game's writing, helped greatly by some very good performances by Troy Baker and Travis Willingham. Those are my biggest compliments to the game, and unfortunately everything else is weaker.

If you don't count the side missions, the game is very short. I know that calling a game short is a very common complaint, to the point that anything that isn't a 60 hour RPG is considered too short, but I'm serious. The game is REALLY short. I find most of the characters interesting. You gain two sidekicks who you can push to the path of good or evil, but this is limited to one brief quest chain, and neither of them feel as fleshed out as they should. And even though I praise it, I feel like a lot more could have been done with Delsin and Reggie's relationship. Another problem is that the game is almost completely disconnected from the first two games. The canon ending of the second game is largely ignored, and the only explanation for it is found on DLC.

As for gameplay, the powers are fun, but barring a few small differences, they all function largely the same. In may be a partial necessity so that players aren't deprived of certain essential functions, but the different powers often feel more like an excuse to show off the system's graphical power than to make the gameplay varied. In this game, you switch up powers by absorbing different sources of energy. The problem with this is that sometimes there might not be a nearby source of energy for whatever power you're using, so you either have to change it up or drop out of combat to find what you need. And despite the similarity between powers, I feel they aren't always balanced. Your first powerset, Smoke, is completely useless after you've fully upgraded Neon. In the first games, you were developing one type of power, with a single ancillary power in 2. Because the total number of upgrades are divided between different sets of powers, I never felt as powerful as I did with Cole. This combined with the problems previously mentioned means that combat can sometimes be tedious. A minor gripe is that the powers often work the same as Cole's did, but without justification. Cole's electrical powers were by no means realistic, but at least most of them were believeable from a fantasy standpoint. But this game never explains how smoke can heal people, or how concrete allows you to hover through the air. I don't demand realism, but I feel that even superpowers should have some kind of logic behind them.

A problem continuing from the previous games is a repetitive mission structure. You develop each new power in exactly the same way, and each district as the exact same set of side quests, with almost no variation within those quests. Infamous' Karma system has always been widely criticized, and it feels like it's in this game more because people expected it to be, not because the developers actually had any ideas for it. People have reported the the story barely changes depending on what you chose to do, and in the late game one character's dialogue in particular makes absolutely no sense if you haven't been playing as a hero. A problem with the sidequests, and even the main story quests is that not a one involves you interacting with the normal citizens of the city. Although their reactions to you still change depending on how you act, you don't feel the same connection with them that the original games had.

What all this adds up to is a game where it feels like the developers put a lot of effort into the graphics, while everything else was a rushjob. It's a next gen game that does next to nothing to push the envelope, for either the system or for game development in general. As popular as the original game was, Second Son won't be what the PS4 is known for.","The graphics are great, everything else is shallow.",1408924800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

But it should have a driving line that you can toggle on.  Especially during the campaign mode where so many of the events are so dark, you really can't see where you're going or are supposed to go.  And the campaign mode also desperately needs a selectable difficulty setting.  The ""one size fits all"" difficulty of the campaign is ridiculously difficult beyond the first one or two major sections.  Instead of being fun, it's just more punishing than anything else.  And definitely needs a broader selection of cars, especially from Japan, and not so heavily weighted toward exotics and super cars.  Hope they can fix some of these issues, otherwise, I'll be sticking primarily with the time trials for now until The Crew and Project Cars come out, and then switching over to those.
1/1/16 Update
They did add a slightly easier difficulty setting, which does allow you to get a bit further in the main campaign, but the difficulty is still way, way too high.  In it's current form, it's still really only for a small handful of the most dedicated (especially those with a wheel accessory) who don't mind beating their head against a wall for many hours while they try to memorize a given track and the exact quirks of each individual car.  Definitely not for the average gamer.  It could help immensely if you could upgrade the cars, but sadly, that's not an option.  Maybe in a sequel (if there ever is one).  The Crew, Project Cars and WRC 5 are MUCH more reasonable and a lot more fun as a result.

The PC version does look better than this, but this should be expected.

I am loving the controls, it just feels right. There are just enough buttons to do what you need to do. Moving around is so much easier, and the dodge feature is a nice addition.

I like that they took the auction house out of the game entirely, I hated it. It took all the fun out of finding drops, since you could always find something better on the AH. No more dealing with a million filters and spending hours searching for gear every time you level up. In the console version, you use what you find and deal with it. Much more fun IMO!

Pumped to have friends over for co-op too. I don't understand the haters here, this is definitely worth $60.

-Easier to control

Pros:

-  Graphics are great. The courses and cars are really terrific. You can see them in action in the free portion if/when it actually releases.
-  Handling is fun. The cars are sticky and you can bale out with the e-brake; I like it, but that is totally a personal preference.
-  Menus are easy to navigate. Considering the game has almost zero customization, this was expected.
-  Cars are unlocked very quickly and have decidedly different feels to them.

Cons:

-  Online (i.e. the ""club"" part of Driveclub) is not functional as of today.
-  AI does not play by the same rules. This essentially breaks single player. The A.I. can put you into a wall from behind and you can  expect to lose points for the collision as well going into the wall.
-  As the A.I. crashes wildly into you at all times, some challenges are impossibly difficult. I have a video posted on PSN (jburd75) with cars relentlessly crashing into me at the back of the pack instead of running the race.
-  No customization. No tuning, no custom liveries, no custom colors. Exceptionally basic. There is more customization on iOS racers than Driveclub.
-  All the cars are from Europe. Not a GTR, Vette...nothing. No excuses. Being a PS+ member who also paid $50 for the game better  qualify me for some more rides for FREE.

4,False,"01 21, 2014",ADLVFFE4VBT8,B00BGAA29M,Cthulhu,"Knack was one of our PS4 launch title mainly, at the time, because new consoles need games and because we trusted that the game's creative director, Mark Cerny who is also PS4's lead architect would produce something good. A couple of months later, Knack is still played in our house mainly by our 10 year old and she loves it.

So, let's discuss the game's qualities and shortcomings. Knack is meant to be an early showcase of what the PS4 can do and in that respect it succeeds but not completely. It is great at demonstrating the PS4's handling of particle effects with the game's main character recreating itself out of hundreds or little pieces swirling around and the PS4 does with apparent ease something that would have for sure caused frame drops on a previous generation console. The graphics are crisp but the cartoonish theme does not allow the game to show how well PS4 handles details, shading or facial expressions. The game plays well and the controls are responsive but, again, I've never had the impression that the console's capabilities were stretched in any way.

As far as the plot/story is concerned well... our 10 year old likes playing the game. Since it's always robot vs. robot, violence, destruction and enemy annihilation don't seem to bother her, especially since her previous 'big' console game was BRAVE which was a lot darker and more gruesome. She loves the fact that the PS4 makes it so easy to co-op. Me or one of her brothers can easily drop in and out of her game whenever she needs a little assistance or just for fun and that does make the game more fun.

Yes, I know that many so-called professional game critics decided that Knack is one of those game it's 'safe' to constantly joke about. I doubt that they spent much time actually playing the game and I suspect that they spent a lot of time parroting each other. The fact is that, as simple and straightforward as the plot may be, the game has a lot of depth, it can be played for many, many hours and you can adjust the difficulty to match your skills and your motivation.

Overall, I would say that this is not a perfect game but it CAN be fun, especially for someone new to console gaming. Actually finishing the game and getting all the trophies may feel like a chore because there's so much to do but I'm sure that there would be people complaining if the game was shorter.

So far I have been playing 'The Last of Us' and I have to say the graphics are pretty amazing, compared to the last generation consoles. And understandably, the drawback for this console is its lack of library selection in games. Hopefully Sony and its third party game makers will produce more entertaining games in the future as they did for PS3.

The console is very compact in size. It is smaller than the slim version of Xbox 360 and about the same size as the second model PS3. In the looks department, I would consider PS4 as the Lamborghini of gaming consoles. But unlike the exotic sports cars, the console is very quiet like all electric vehicles. As aforementioned, the PS4 controller is a definite step-up from its older brother DC3. The controller has built-in speakers and fancy lights emanating from its head. I'm not entirely sure what purpose those lights serve, but they're cool to look at nonetheless. My biggest gripe with the controller though is its battery life. Comparing to the DualShock 3, DC 4 needs to be recharged every four to five hours depending on your usage. The good news is the console package does come with USB cable for your controller so you can charge it whenever you need to.

Over all, I am pretty happy with the purchase of PlayStation 4.

***Update 1.7.14***

Steelseries has worked with me to figure out why certain aspects were not working. It appears that you have to make sure you change power settings in on your USB ports. Also they had a BIOS update that may have helped to clean things up. Now we are starting to get this thing purring and will absolutely keep it! Great help from Steelseries and a well built keyboard. Really like the zone control to set for specific games. Creates a mood.

***Update 1.15.14***

Unfortunately still having issues with this keyboard. Have had to mess with Bios, USB settings and what I plug it into. Generally when I start my computer I have to reset it everytime after it loads to get all the keyboard functions to work. When it works, it's a great keyboard that I really like. However the way this is going I may have to go back to Razer or Logitech. Have my Anansi sitting in a box but just can't stand how loud it is.

***Update 1.24.14***

Still having issues which requires the computer to be reset before I can use the keyboard properly. So far the customer service has been pretty generic. At this point trying to get a brand new keyboard replacement or a full refund. Should work out of the box. Waiting on Steelseries to answer this question which has taken nearly a week.

***Update 2.27.14***

It appears that I had a faulty keyboard out the gate. Since receiving a brand new replacement from SteelSeries it has been perfect! Not a single issue remains. The communication between them is slow but they took care of the problem. For that I have to bump up my rate to 4 stars. Can't do 5 because it took nearly 1 1/2 months to get it resolved.

Cons:
-No strap to carry it by. It would be nice if it had a small strap or something to make carrying/grabbing it a little nicer. I might add one to mine if I can figure out a good way to do it.
-Only has slots for 3 games and one card. Seems like they could have fit slots for about 5 games and 2 cards up there with a little better space management (I knew this going in though and had already planned to add some slots to the center flap, managed to fit 10 pouches on that flap on the side not facing the screen, didn't want to put any facing the screen).

(Note:  This review is written while on chapter 4 after about 18 hours of play mostly in item world and having not finished the entire game yet, so no spoilers capable and more so just some general mechanics commentary)

~Item rarity levels removed.  Just streamlined down to Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary (might be another in there).  No longer will I be upset I have a level 3 legendary sword and need to find a level 1 or 0 one.  That honestly saves a ridiculous number of hours of item world diving

~Item world ships required.  Starts you off with one that goes down to level 10 and you quickly get one to go down to level 30.  You're very likely to encounter a smaller ship from the cat pirates that also takes you just as deep as level 10.  Means you have more searching to do than just immediately farming the basement of item world.

~Character promotions.  Now you can have your rank 1 version of a toon just be promoted to the higher rank version of him/herself.  Makes life easier at the lower levels of trying to maximize your character stats, instead of having to wait to power level them significantly later in the game.

~""More expensive stuff"" rationed by chapter level.  So you'll have to find your awesome ""You shouldn't have this on your first playthrough"" stuff in item world, instead of just diving for a few hours, passing the ""more expensive stuff"" all the way through, and using your item world money to buy the highest tier items.  Game balance issue, makes going through item world a bit slower as well, but more enjoyable.

~Pirates either show up before your turn 1 or not at all.  Don't have to spend 2 turns waiting to see if they arrive if you're hunting for pirate ships, you know from the start.  This REALLY saves a lot of time.

~Character specializations:  Each character type gets 3 specializations.  Like one of the healers has the Evility choices of ""When you heal others, you heal yourself"", OR ""Heal for an extra 20%"" OR ""Regain 5% of SP at end of turn"" (those aren't all on the same guy but you get the idea).  Makes for some extra customization.

4,False,"10 18, 2015",AWZXZL8P7UYON,B00BQHQPSM,Kristin,"Overall I enjoyed this game a lot.  If you're a fan of previous Saints Row games, GTA or other open world third person games, you will probably enjoy this.  So let's get to the good, the bad and the ugly!

The Bad:

1. It's the same map of Steelport that we saw in SR3.  I'm not really sure if this is that bad, but near the end of playing SR3 I was getting a little bored with it.  So now I'm back in the same map as before.  It's a little different thanks to all the alien stuff going on, but its the same buildings, layout, etc.  I get what happened here.  Create new scenarios, new missions, use the same map and cars, etc as before and you can churn out a new game in half the time.  So that's basically what this is.  It's SR3 with new missions, challenges, etc.  My understanding is that this was originally supposed to be an expansion pack for SR3 so that would make a lot of sense.

2. It's a little too over the top for my taste.  I thought SR3 was a little over the top to be honest but this was just way over the top, which I get they did on purpose.  My personal preference is something based a little closer to reality which is what they did in SR2, which to me was the best game of the series.  Something closer to a GTA 4 or GTA 5 in which you still have a lot of wild things going on, but it's wild stuff that's more rooted in reality if that makes any sense.  That having been said, I do enjoy a lot of the humor in the Saints Row series.  BUT, that having been said, I think the writing for SR4 was a little weak.  There aren't nearly as many funny comments going on the streets, not as many things being said and done, not as many little jokes and references all over the place like we're used to.  To be honest, the game feels rushed, like they slapped it together to push it out the door and didn't really take their time to make it super clever.

The Good:

1. If you liked SR3, you'll enjoy this.  It's more of the same fun and is even more over the top.  The ""Matrix"" like story is fun and interesting, aliens have replaced gangs as your enemies and while some of the challenges are familiar, others like the hotspot challenges or climbing the towers are kind of fun and a little different.

2. You get some interesting new powers.  Since it is the Matrix, you can jump super high, run super fast and there's a few other neat new tricks.  Some of the powers reminded me of a game called Prototype that I played a while back in terms of the jumping and running.

3. Overall it is a lot of fun and given that you can pick it up on sale now for $10 or less, it's definitely worthwhile to get.  I mean at that price you'll certainly get enough gameplay out of it to make it worthwhile and look, it is a fun game big time.  It's my hope that SR5 (and I'm sure there will be one) will do what GTA 5 did which is to really go to the next level rather than just doing more off the same platform.

The Ugly:

There really isn't any ugly, it's a fun game and again, if you get it on sale, it will be well worth it for you.

Then, it became less serious than GTA and added more humor. This fourth one moves away from the regular gang versus gang type of story and adds a twist by adding amazing superhero abilities. Before I purchased this, I told myself not to judge it immediately and to give it a try since I knew the game had superhero abilities and more silly stuff.

After playing it for a few hours, I was having tons of fun. There are a lot of things to do, and now that you have superhero abilities, you can do whatever you feel like doing. Use telekinesis, race around running at super speed, jump from a skyscraper and bring wrath to your enemies with a ""death from above"" nuclear explosion. I enjoyed the storyline. Everything about it made sense. It wasn't like they came up with ridiculously crazy stuff and did not have an explanation for it. I also enjoyed hanging out with your homies and the option to romance them(LOL). Got a thing for Shaundi or Gat? Go for it. Hahaha. It was fun to chat with your homies and bring the fight to your enemies with superpowers or funky weapons. Believe...there are plenty of FUNKY weapons. I won't spoil too much, but you'll definitely have tons of fun with them.

Moreover, if you enjoy games that have references from music, movies, or video games...this is definitely for you. I could not help but laugh at all the funny video game references throughout the game. As with the other games, you're still able to customize your character and your crew. I wish they had added something to customize your ship, but since you're at war, I guess there is no time for that. The graphics are an improvement from the past games, and the soundtrack is great.

I have no regrets in purchasing this. If you want a serious game about gang versus gang type of story, this may not be for you.

5,False,"03 15, 2014",A3PYKVR7T3XM14,B00BTGP1OY,Potter Lover,"""To the Moon"" is an achievement in storytelling. It succeeds where so many games fail: it makes you feel. Whether it's making you laugh or making you cry, you're always feeling something, and you're falling in love with its characters a little more every minute. While it might not seem like much of game at times (and that is indeed one of the only valid criticisms that can be leveled against it), ""To the Moon"" is a game that deserves your attention.

""To the Moon"" (TtM) is the story of two doctors who grant a dying man his last wish: he wants to go to the moon. They grant him this wish with a machine that lets him relive his life from the beginning in his mind; from birth up to the end, the doctors go through the events his life trying to change things in the hope that he'll end up rocketing to the moon. But at the end of this ""new life"", he'll die. And that's how the story takes off, if you'll pardon the pun. Or not. Your choice.

It's honestly a pretty simple, though some might say lacking, game on the surface. It's really just an adventure game (some would argue that it's more of a visual novel) that consists almost entirely of walking around and clicking on different items to progress the story. There's also lots of text to click through. Judged simply on it's gameplay, TtM is nothing special. In fact, it might even seem kind of boring to those who crave action or difficult puzzles. There are some who would go so far as to say that there's so little interactivity it shouldn't be considered a game at all, and it's true that at its core it requires you to click on stuff and read through lots of text, since there's no voice acting at all. If that sounds like a nightmare to you, than maybe TtM is not the game for you. But if you don't mind a bit of reading, you'll find one of gaming's best experiences here, bar none.

TtM is a supremely powerful piece of art, and not just because it's pretty. It is pretty, though. The retro 32-bit art is a truly inspired style, but it's slightly ironic that the old-school feel inspired by its visuals is at such odds with its truly modern-feeling story. It's hard to believe that a story like this could have been told in a game twenty, ten, or even five years ago. Dealing with themes such as mental illness, the moments and people that define us, and childhood trauma in a truly sensitive and respectful way, TtM is in a class of its own, not just among video games, but among media as a whole.

Even the soundtrack is inspired, especially the absolutely incredible piano pieces and ending theme, and it's responsible for driving home a lot of the emotion in the game's most memorable scenes. I got the soundtrack in a bundle with the game, and every now and then I'll listen to one of the songs, just for kicks. Each time, I'm immediately pulled back to a moment in the game and I remember exactly how I felt in that moment, exactly what the characters were doing, exactly what I was thinking about. It's one of those things you just don't forget. It's just that good.

Maybe it seems like I'm overselling this game, but that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, I think I've undersold the game so far. What I really want to say is: ""Buy this game right now to save your immortal soul from an eternity of unsatisfied discontent. You will never truly live until you play this game, nor be will you be able to truly die."" There, that about sums up what I feel. To add to that, the game is only 10 bucks on Amazon (12.49 on Steam for the soundtrack bundle, and trust me, that 2.49 is SO worth it), and you'll be supporting an insanely talented indie developer by picking it up!

Metro Last Light picks up after the events of the first game and tells more of the aftermath of Artyome's actions in 2033. The threat of the Dark Ones still lingers, and larger than life events are on the horizen for the peoples of the Metro. Its up to the newest Ranger of the Order to save everyone from complete obliteration.... last bullet... last hope... last light.....

The gameplay is largely unchanged, you can still do a multitude of actions typically done for you in other games, like charge your flashlight, observe your objective(in real time on a notepad) and even whipe debris and blood from your gasmask(which you also have to manually equip) there hasn't been any dreaded ""streamlining"" in this regard. Where slight changes have been made(for the better) is in regards to combat, a simple melee button has been added, and the gunplay is much more responsive and tighter than before, ensuring you aren't flailing about when a mutant is trying to take a chunk out of you.

The game's previous issue of weapon level progression has also changed, ditching the system of buying a gun with preset upgrades in exchange for an actual customization system allowing you to choose different attachements(such as scopes, silencers, and stocks) sadly the bayonette for the Shambler(assault shotgun) is absent this time around >_< The game progresses through a number of levels, ranging from the dark dank depths of the Metro to the surface world above, both being infested with enemies, both human... and otherwise.

5,False,"07 21, 2013",A357QFX18ZPFQ8,B00BU3ZLJQ,Sara&#039;06,"Minecraft... is an awesome game... why? because it's like Legos on steroids! However I would prefer this version over the other one for the PC for many reasons. So let's dig into Minecraft the 360 Edition and see what we come up with.

Straight off the bat you might notice somethings a bit different, how so? Simply put that compared to the PC edition the 360 edition is actually a bit of a downgrade in terms of versions rather than being in the 1.0.0 release area it's actually the 1.8 release which I'm glad for because while having the ""carrot on a stick"" thing is good because you can control a pig while riding it with it and the whole trade system with NPC's is quite nice it actually feels quite good to just go back and marvel at how far Notch has come with this series. One of the things I liked about this game is the book recipe, you see after the 1.2.2 release I believe it's somewhere in there,I can't remember where that instead of putting three pieces of paper to make a book you would need that and one piece of leather which for some odd reason on my end like about 90% of the time the cows will not drop leather and all I would get is either steak or none at all.  I have no idea why that happens on my end but yeah. Back in the good old days all you needed was just sugar cane, that's it, as long as you have sugar cane in your farm (which more than likely I do) you can basically have infinite number of books and bookshelves.
Another reason why I would prefer this version over the PC one is the new ""Crafting menu""! You see in the PC edition you would have to use the crafting table, upon doing so you would have to put the items in manually like for a stone pickaxe you would have to put two sticks here, three cobblestone there and you would have to repeat that over and over to get the desired amount of stone pickaxes you want. With the 360 editions new Crafting Menu all would need is just the ingredients and then press the A button as many times as you like to get that many in a shorter amount of time which makes all crafting easier and faster. Not only that but it also shows the recipe itself on what you need to make that item/tool which makes having to go onto your web browser not a necessity when persay you forgot how to make an enchantment table and it turns out you need four obsedion, two diamond, and a book. The Crafting Menu shows that so that you know ""Oh so that's what I was missing I thought you also need two redstone torches to make one of these."" so yeah, Crafting Menu, so much more helpful. Another thing I like about this edition of the game is the NPC villages, you see, when it comes to those places it's usually so hard to lokate them because the world is usually infinite so it's a tad harder to find them.... a LOT harder actually so in the PC edition those are kind of rare. Now I don't know if it is implemented with the game or I have been extremely lucky but every each time you make a new world you spawn either right next to a village or you spawn like about a mile from it. One final thing I love about this one is the music, not only it's the same as the PC one but also it constantly plays as you work in your mine which makes it less boring, the PC one as you have music on it doesn't play as much it just plays after every real life hour and without the music it's just boring.

What I don't get is the tutorial mode, yes this edition of the game comes with a tutorial mode for people who haven't played the game before though don't know why anyone has never played it before when this game has sold well over one billion copies of it combined with this one and the PC edition and made new sales break on Xbox 360 new release games. but here's what I don't get, it has that but it gives you a slight tutorial on playing the game when you first install it and make a new level which in of itself makes the whole tutorial mode thing kind of pointless to be honest, why have that when you have it in-game anyways? The other thing that I don't like about this edition is that the world is not infinite which kind of makes you wonder if the Xbox 360 really is one of those most powerful system of all time (or at least all of you 360 fans out there say that, not that there's anything wrong with that.) but that's sort of forgiven as it does give you a NPC village straight off the bat rather than putting it a million (and I mean by that literally) miles away from where you spawn. I do believe the set number is 860X860.... or was it 680X680? I can't remember but all I do remember is that it has an invisible wall and that sometimes can get frustrating because from what I heard is that sometimes in abandon mines there would be a chest for you to collect but you can't get it because it spawned out of the invisible wall which makes you think that the game is trolling you by doing so. For the hardcore Minecraftians that's a little disappointing but for people that want to play it and have a good old time like me it's not much of a bother.
So what do I think about this game? Honestly I give it a 10/10, in my eyes it's ten times better than the PC edition even though it's a downgrade in comparison with other versions of it. With the Crafting Menu showing recipes and to just gather the ingredients to make the item is just so much more helpful than having to do it manually. The music is the same but it plays constantly thus making the game much more interesting than having it play every real time hour or so before a new song can be played. As you can tell by the section of my likes about this game you can tell that I had a blast playing it and I still am. I totally recommend playing this rather than the PC edition for fun and enjoyment in single player mode, multiplayer is still fun either way but single player is a totally different experience between the two.",MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!,1374364800,4,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' Xbox 360'}",

And while Thief does has its moments, it's ultimately a letdown.

The 15 minute preview video I watched of the first mission boasted ""There are multiple ways to approach this; what follows is just one method"".  Here's the problem:  The game FORCES you into scenarios.  Doors/windows/hatches close behind you.  Want to drop down?  Sometimes you can without a button press, sometimes it requires a button press, and sometimes you can't at all, even if it appears you can.  There is a grand illusion at work in ""The City"" (really?  In 2014, that's the best you can come up with?  talk about an ""F"" for originality!) that you can be a master thief and go anywhere, and do anything, to get the loot.  Not so.

And, to make matters worse, by the midpoint of the game you will acquire a skill which will let you deal with guards with your fists if you're spotted (i.e. instead of being killed you'll kill them).  Essentially, this breaks the need to play stealth, and while that's appreciated for people who don't want to try to do an entire run of the game without being spotted on Master Thief difficulty, it does kinda defeat the purpose of a game built on a stealth premise.  Focus also pretty much makes the game broken, you can choose not to use it, then why offer it in the first place then?

And even with the new generation of gaming systems, the enemy AI apparently is still stuck in the PS2 era as guards get stuck in the environment and will otherwise just ignore you all together unless you make it blatantly obvious (i.e. run smack into them, leave a dead body right in the middle of the room/street, etc).

Finally, LOAD TIMES.  Wow.  Forget it if you expect a seamless transfer between environments.  You're looking at a 20-40 second load time EVERY time.  That is absolutely unacceptable in this generation of consoles, period.

This seems like a game destined for a discount within the first 2-3 months of release and is NOT a game you should be paying full price for.  The in-game map is atrocious and almost unusable, enemy combat is handled with the triggers vs. the face buttons and is a poor man's version of the Arkham games, and while the graphics and sound are great, it reminds me of a saying ""If you put lipstick on a pig, it is still a pig"".

So consider it 4 or 5 stars for the graphics, sound and potential replay value, and 1-3 stars (depending on your level of annoyance) with the U/I, controls, gameplay and overall polish.

If that's something you're willing to pay $60 for, more power to you.

If you are just a casual basketball fan that just wants to play a quick game you are probably best served staying or buying 2k13( or if you're into the classic teams 2k11 for Jordan challenge, or 2k12 for the legends challenge).

With that out of the way, this is the best pure basketball simulation that has been released to date. In every sense it feels like the culmination of the 2k series on the court for this generation of consoles. Defense has been improved, especially inside. Contact in the paint feels a lot better than last year, and the new shot blocking system implemented feels great. There is no better feeling than chasing down a player on the fast break for a highlight block, 2k14 delivers this in spades. Controls have been changed for what feels like the 3rd or 4th year in a row. The right stick is now used for both dribble moves and shooting, with the L2 trigger being a new modifier for flashy passes. It takes a few games to get used to, especially if you played a lot of 2k13, but once you do you'll be pulling of crossovers, eurosteps, fadeaways and floaters in no time.

Graphically this is the same game we have gotten for the last few years, the presentation is essentially the same as last year as well. The only new mode is the Lebron challenge where you can play through the rest of Lebron's career, either staying with the Heat or taking your talents out of South Beach. I haven't put much time into this, but I imagine its a nice little alternate reality mode, and Lebron fans will love it.

So should you buy 2k14? I would say yes if you are a huge NBA fan and aren't planning on getting a next gen system at launch. This is the best pure basketball game made to date. If you haven't played a 2k game in years, by all means get this game. If you are planning on getting a PS4/XBox One you would probably be better off waiting for the next gen version(which by the recent trailer looks incredible). If you fall into the casual basketball fan category, you are probably better off saving some money and getting either last years version, or 2k11 or 2k12 for the legend modes(Only hardcore players will notice any substantial differences on the court, but they are there for those that are in the know).  So with this release it is clear 2k's main focus was the next gen version, this is a ""playing it safe"" release in every sense, but honestly it was to be expected, this is the eighth 2k game on this generation of consoles and quite frankly we have seen worse thing from yearly sports titles, the fact that this is one of the best sports games on the market on old hardware gives them a pass imo.",For Hardcore NBA Fans,1380672000,22,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

1.  This game is has a rating of E (for Everyone) which is appropriate based on the rating index, but please note, this game will most likely be boring for most kids above the age of 8 or so.
2. The game is for Wii U.  Like most game platforms, Wii U games CANNOT be played on a standard Wii console.  Most people know this, but just in case.

The game itself is fun, again, for a younger player.  It is a bit pricey for the amount of game play.  A 10 or 12 year old who is familiar with video games will probably navigate the entire game in a few hours of play.  The theme of the game is that Smurfette has been kidnapped.  You can play as one of four Smurfs, in a co-operative mode if you like.  You start with a few Smurfs and can unlock others as you play.  You collect Smurfberries to aid in your quest.  Game play is on a scrolling background, from side to side.

Although the Wii U platform has enhanced graphics compared to Wii, this game doesn't really take advantage of that.  Graphics are decent, but the backgrounds, ""worlds"", etc are lackluster.  A couple of the backgrounds are nicely done, but overall.....eh.

That said, for a very young child, maybe 4 to 6, they probably will like to play, especially since the concept is simple, their motor skills would be appropriate, and if they've seen the Smurf movie, they'll likely relate to seeing their favorite character on a video game they can play.  For an older child, beyond say 8 or 9 - it probably will not hold their interest very long, unless they are new to video games.

Wii U does have the nicety of allowing for a 5th player, something which could matter if you have 5 young siblings/friends who all want to play.

Dream Team for the 3DS seemed to be a good place to start. I heard wonderful things about the series, it's humour and how it's in some ways the successor of the cult classic Super Mario RPG Legend of the 7 stars for SNES. I was pleased to discover that it really is an rpg based game and that it also keeps element of Mario games and the Mushroom Kingdom intact.

The 3DS doesn't have a plethora of RPGs, Mario & Luigi Dream Tram is one of the few. The attacks are turn-based and the animation while not incredible suits the RPG mold and gives it a cool obscure game feel. The battles are a lot of fun and probably the best part of the game.  It's not terribly unique as an RPG in case you're wondering, but it's simultaneously unique to the Mario library and carries the torch for Super Mario RPG. In Dream Team you deal with XP points and level ups, buying clothes that provide stronger levels or armour, and learning new attacks.

Dream Team doesn't have your traditional levels typically found in a Mario game. Instead, it's a free-roaming environment where you often get drawn into the dream world which is where the levels occur. You engage in battles with magical and otherworld beings as well but in the dream world the goal is to free trapped innocent creatures. You get to dream world whenever you encounter a pillow. Every time you do, Luigi goes to sleep and becomes ""Dream Luigi"" where he had superpowers that help Mario, well mostly just his moustache. This works to comical effects and is good for a few chuckles. Sometimes the dream are demanding and demand some critical thinking and problem solving (as is the case throughout most of the gams), sometimes it's very short and relatively easy.

One of the problems l have is there is SO MUCH TEXT! It's hard to follow everything and quite frankly some of it is unnecessary and it gets tiring and boring to be honest. You can't skip text either, although you can accelerate it. Tutorials are abundant as well, you can't escape them. The game also can't remind you enough that you control Mario and Luigi jointly and are responsible to control them both. These things to me, level down the game. It feels aimed more at children for those reasons than longtime fans.

The main issue with Mario & Luigi Dream Team is there is strong conpetition from other Mario titles for the 3DS. This one doesn't stand out and it doesn't compete all that well. If you want something similar with some RPG elements that offers a better experience, try Paper Mario Sticker Star or another RPG title. I feel if the game had less text/tutorials and offered slightly more Dream Team could've gone from being a good title that's slightly annoying to a great one. It it was faster and had a better flow my rating would've been that much higher.

As it stands, l think it's a fun game, l love the RPG elements. Obviously the concept worked well enough to warrant three sequels. It's charming, it's funny, it has adventure and it offers something different for a Mario game which is wonderful. Nintendo just needs to get to the drawing board and do better with the next Mario & Luigi game. 3 stars.","Fun RPG elements, game would have benefited from better flow",1448668800,,,

Fox,"Mario Party: Island Tour is not a Mario party that I would recommend to people who have enjoyed older Mario parties on the GameCube and N64 and want this game to be like them. The boards are very short and most seem to be about getting to the end first. The game mechanics are changed almost entirely from the Mario parties 1-8 I believe. This game requires no skill and is just about completely luck based. While you can say that it is a step up from Mario party 9, that does not necessarily mean that it is that good. I would only buy this for a young child and not a Mario gamer. If you still want to experience a Mario party game, go to the
Wii menu and get Mario party two from Wii virtual console on Wii shop channel. The only thing is that it requires a Wii classic or GameCube controller, but that is still a lot less than $30-$40. Plus you can use those controllers for other virtual console games and games like Mario kart. I will admit though, there are some good points. This game if full of fun and addicting minigames for anyone to enjoy. For those who like simple and relaxing games, there are 2 different Dr. Mario like games. One is like Dr. Mario but instead of one pill it is like you have two pills attached to each other that separate when the ground is uneven. The next one is very similar to the first one, but instead you are competing against other players or computer players. There is also a mode where you go through floors of minigames and battle several bosses. Once you reach bowser and defeat him you get to play as Bowser Jr. But one more problem is your Mario party points. All you can use them for is art, mainly of characters and courses you have already seen. You might want to buy this game, but don't expect any type of fun on the main game. But for a Dr. Mario type game with a competing mode + the many fun minigames + Bowser's Tower you may consider purchasing it. Just remember if you want it to be like most Mario parties, you're probably going to be disappointed.

4,False,"06 24, 2013",A2VBFLA8LNMHGZ,B00CHYOP94,Gaming.Fit,"When I first started up Game and Wario, I noticed that my Wii remotes kept turning themselves off. I recalibrated them a few times before I realized that this was intentional. This game doesn't use the Wii remotes at all. It just uses your Wii U GamePad and your TV.

Game and Wario is a collection of 16 mini-games, 4 of them multi-player, and 12 of them single player. It was originally created to be a demonstration of the Wii U's GamePad, much as Wii Sports was a demonstration of the Wii Remote's capabilities. But the story goes that the developers ended up designing so many of these games that they decided to release them as a stand-alone title.

It's a shame that at least some of these didn't come pre-installed on the Wii U, as I think the slow sales of the Wii U are at least partially due to people being perplexed by the GamePad. Yes, there are a few hints of its potential in Nintendo Land, but Game and Wario really shows off the full potential of the GamePad.

Here's a description of each of the games.

Multi-player:

1) Fruit

In this game, a player on the GamePad chooses a random cartoon character who is the ""thief"" who has to steal some fruit scattered around the scene. He controls the player on the GamePad, trying to blend into a crowded scene of other cartoon characters milling about. 2-4 players watch the TV and try to pick out which character the thief is, based on clues such as the thief ""standing out a bit"" when stealing fruit and a camera focused on the general location of the thief every 30 seconds. It's certainly not as interactive or frenetic as Mario Chase on Nintendo Land; it's more a game of observation. I'd give this a 4 of 5.

2) Disco

This is an interesting game where two players each hold one end of the GamePad. Music will play, and one player will press buttons to the beat. The other player will have to match the buttons to the beat on his side. They'll then alternate turns. It's sort of an odd mix between Guitar Hero and the old game Simon.  I'd give it a 3 of 5, as the controls are kind of quirky.

3) Islands

This is a game where players take turns slingshotting these block-like creatures called ""Fronks"" from your GamePad (which you point towards the TV) onto a playing field on the TV. It's sort of like shuffleboard or curling in that you can knock other players' Fronks out of the way. Plus, the field itself will change depending on where the Fronks are lying. This one is very clever and a lot of fun in a group. 5 of 5.

4) Sketch

Think Pictionary or Draw Something, where one player draws a word and 1-4 players try to guess it. It's a ton of fun with 3-5 total players, as you can compete with each other, the winner being the one with the highest total of correct guesses plus correctly-guessed drawings. If you're just two players, your scores are totalled and you can try to beat your high scores. It's cute how they display your drawings at the end in a slideshow. 5 of 5.

Single Player:

The single player games come with the first game unlocked, but you have to complete each game to unlock the next one. Spoiler Alert: if you want to discover each new game on your own vs. reading about them here, you can skip to the last paragraph of this review.

Here's a description of each of the mini-games, as well as my own personal rating for each (YMMV, of course).

1) Arrow

In this game, you hold the GamePad horizontally, pointing at the TV. You can draw back and arrow on the GamePad and shoot it onto the TV screen. It's similar to Takamura's Ninja Castle in Nintendo Land, except that you're drawing back and arrow to shoot it vs. swiping a nunchuk. An interesting twist is when a cannon shoots a cannonball at you, and you have to hold up the GamePad as a shield (and hear a clang as it hits). This was fun but became frustrating when the action started getting fast and the GamePad couldn't always stay aligned with the TV. 3 of 5.

2) Shutter

Think Jimmy Stewart in ""Rear Window"" for this one. You're given a set of ""suspects"" to take pictures of in a scene with three apartment buildings. You see the entire view of a scene on the TV, and you can use the GamePad to point and zoom in with the joystick, pressing a button to take a snapshot once you identify a suspect. Suspects may be walking around or closing their blinds, so you need to be quick. Bonus points for taking clear and close-up pictures. This one is ingenious and a lot of fun, and as you progress to other levels there are interesting new scenarios. 5 of 5.

3) Ski

In this game, you're controlling a funky skiier out of the 70's complete with disco-style blue 'fro. You see an overhead view on the GamePad, while spectators can watch a first-person view on the TV. Your goal is to tilt the GamePad and guide him down the slope. It's not so much a skiing game as it is like those old handheld puzzle games with the marbles that you have to tilt to guide along a path. Still, it's a clever way to combine the GamePad with the TV. 3 of 5.

4) Patchwork

This is literally a puzzle game where you'll have different patches of different shapes that you have to fit within a pattern that you have to pick out. Not as easy as it seems. Nice touch when you solve the puzzle and your puzzle turns into a cartoon object, such as a flower or a horse. 3 of 5

5) Kung Fu

Here's another game where you see an overhead view on the GamePad and a first-person view on the TV. Unlike Ski, here you'll be using both views as you play. Your object is to make it across to your master by jumping, collecting scrolls and life-sustaining dumplings on the way. This one takes a little getting used to, I personally was getting a litle dizzy going from one screen to the other. 4 of 5.

6) Gamer

This one had me laughing out loud. The premise is that you're a kid in bed playing with a Game Boy Advance-type handheld game. The games you play are a lot like the ""microgames"" found in WarioWare, ranging from picking a nose with the right timing to mashing the three correct buttons in a tiny fighting game. What makes this game ""meta"" is that all the while you have to watch for your mom, who pops her head in from the door, the window, and creepily, the TV, and hide your game and pretend to sleep as long as she's in the room. Some of the microgames are hilarious, and a lot will bring back memories. 5 of 5.

7) Design

This one is actually sort of educational. You're given tasks to ""draw a 2 inch line"", ""draw a circle with a 2.5 inch diamater"", ""draw a triangle with 1 inch sides"", and so on. Using the stylus, you do your best to estimate shapes and sizes. 5 of 5.

8) Ashley

Ashley is a side-scroller where you control a little flying witch on a broom by tilting your GamePad up and down. You can view a closeup of her angle on the GamePad, but most of the time you'll be looking at the TV. Your goal is to collect as many coins as you can. 4 of 5.

9) Taxi

In this game, you're taxi driver whose potential passengers are being stolen away by UFOs. Your job is to shoot the UFOs down with bazookas, pick up the passengers, and deliver them to a barn. At the end, you need to defeat a boss UFO who's threatening to take the whole barn away. In this game you see a driver's view on the GamePad, while you see a overhead map view on the TV. 5 of 5.

10) Pirates

This is a strange game that's somewhat reminiscent of the old Rhythm Fever Heaven game. Wario the Pirate will direct his men to shoot suction cup arrows at you from ships to the left, right, center, or top. Your job is to listen to which ships Wario is directing, move your GamePad to catch the arrows as they fly into you, and shake the GamePad to drop the arrow; all to a beat. It's another clever bit of ""breaking the fourth wall"" as you can view the arrows coming at you on the TV, and then watch them plop against your GamePad.

Once you finish these ten games, there'll be closing credits with all the characters you've seen throughout the games. And then, the characters all say, ""let's go bowling!"" 5 of 5

11) Bowling

That's right, bowling. In this case the bowling is much less sophisticated than Wii Sports; you use your GamePad to flick the bowling ball, and then tilt the GamePad to get the ball rolling in the right direction. Each of the characters you've encountered before are now printed onto matryoshka-like bowling pins. 3 of 5.

12) Bird

This last game is an homage to both the Pyoro mini-game on WarioWare Inc: Mega Microgame$, as well as  the old Game & Watch handheld games. When looking at the GamePad screen, the gameplay is exactly the same as on an old Game & Watch, complete with LCD patterns, but on the TV screen you'll see a high-resolution version of Pyoro. It's a nice way to bridge the old and the new. Gameplay is simple, and sound effects are strangely soothing. 4 of 5.

Overall, I enjoyed Game & Wario. Throughout the game is the wonderfully quirky sense of humor and campiness that only Nintendo can deliver. As with most mini-games from Nintendo, each one of these games is well-thought out and well-produced; some of the games are more fun than others, but unlike shovelware games there's not really a ""throwaway"" one in the bunch. Similarly the cut scenes and intros are beautifully illustrated and animated.

In a way, Game and Wario highlights both the strengths and the weaknesses of the GamePad controller. On the one hand, I loved how the GamePad and the TV could display two different views of the same action. On the other hand, for some of the games I couldn't help but feel that the GamePad was not much more than a glorified DS. I would have liked to have seen more of the kind of multi-player action that we got a taste of with Nintendo Land (e.g., using Wii remotes) vs. the ""pass and play"" type multi-player experience here.

This is one of those games I'd recommend not necessarily for extensive replay value (I'd say only 3 or 4 of the games are ones that I'd be excited about playing again), but just to be able to show off some of the possibilities with your Wii U's GamePad.

For one thing, the computer AI got increasingly more difficult.  Not that this is a bad thing, but the game has a fatal flaw to it.  Even when the difficulty is set to EASY, and you decrease all the AI Reversals to MINIMUM, the computer is STILL too difficult, and you can't achieve the historical objectives.  In later matches, the computer opponents reverse like crazy!  WHY is this happening when the options have been tweaked to the easiest of settings?  Illogical.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this is a deliberate attempt on behalf of the developers to get more money out of the public.  How?  With the Accelerator Pack DLC for $1.99 that unlocks everything in the game.  You can't unlock everything and get all of the superstars (except for one) without completing the 30 Years of Wrestlemania mode.  2K and Yukes are making it clear that you have to pay an extra $2 to do that.

This devious tactic will NOT be tolerated.  In addition, why do you think this particular DLC is priced so low?  I would imagine that it would be priced really high, like future DLC packs, since it gives you everything.  It's priced at $2 so that people would be able to afford it due to the massive inconsistencies present in the Wrestlemania story mode.

They managed to create an even better version of their controller and this is my experience so far.

Good:
Trigger improvements: Microsoft included what they called `Impulse triggers"" under the triggers for a very unique result while playing games such as Forza 5
Better D-Pad: The main complaint with the past controller was the squishy D-Pad it had which was not very precise and hard to press. All those bad things are gone with the new buttons.
Analog sticks accuracy has improved considerably and their grippy texture feels amazing. You'll notice the difference especially if you have sweaty hands
Battery life is impressive. I've yet to deplete the duracell included AA batteries after a more than 6-7 hours, which is the time it took my PS4 controller to die. The space to put the batteries in the back is not as prominent as the 360's controller reducing the bulkiness appearance. Even after your batteries die, you will be able to use the controller with a wired connection using the micro USB port.
According to what I read, the Xbox uses the Kinect to know when you've put the controller down, to watch TV for example, and puts it in a state which consumes less power than usual.

So-So:
Analog sticks are smaller and you might like that and you might not depending on your hand size I guess. For me, I wouldn't mind them being a little bit bigger, but it's not really a bad thing, just wanted to mention it

Bad:
The bumpers have changed and I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker with this controller but if I had to say something bad about it, it's this. They are more difficult to press/click than the 360's version so depending on the game you're playing, if it has heavy use of the bumpers you might need some extra time to get used to them.
It doesn't come with a rechargeable battery out of the box so you need to buy it separately (like in this item you're reading) but as I mentioned before you won't need to do this very often.",Pretty much the best controller out there,1385078400,89,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I've been using it as a full on media and gaming system for the past two months and feel that I have had enough experience with it to give a good idea about the product.

Games:
Off the bat Xbox One provided a decent amount of games for launch. You can get your usual Call Of Duty & Forza, but what I enjoyed the most was Assassins Creed and Battlefield 4. The games aren't going to be that much different from the Xbox 360 versions because developers are not using the full extent of the Xbox One right away. Those games are coming soon though!

Operating System:
First off, yes I am an Apple person. I work off Apple product ands use them in my everyday life. Xbox is really the only Microsoft product I use and having loved the Xbox 360, I was really hoping for a easy to navigate operating system. I hate to say that the home screen can get confusing when you need to make adjustments and the current friends list is way more complicated then it needs to be. As for party chats, it will take a little time to figure it out, and it's not the best way of doing it but from the looks of it the community is speaking out and we can only hope that Microsoft will provide a update.

Kinect + Voice:
The Kinect system that comes with every Xbox One is just as powerful as Microsoft claims it to be. The device can sign you into your account through facial recognition and can pick up the smallest of movements. That being said, the new TV guide system that is built into the Xbox One works flawlessly with my current cable provider and actually makes it a lot easier to find channels and programs that I enjoy watching. You can use your voice to control what you watch and even to scroll through the guide. No need for the controller!

Overall I have no regrets with the purchase of the Xbox One. I am hoping for more updates to the operating system and a few minor changes to Xbox Live, but overall the new additions to the Xbox line and the future is looking good for the games that are coming out.",Xbox One and Only,1390003200,2,,

Campaign :

I actually enjoyed my playthrough of the campaign and am right now playing through a second time on veteran.. I always go back and play all of my COD games on Veteran because of the huge challenge they pose. Anyway , the story is engaging enough to keep you pulled in the entire time and keeps you wanting to push forwards. This is always a good thing in a game , and this game is like this all the way through.

Campaign Graphics :

The game looks good , but just doesn't look great. This game is supposed to be running on a new and enhanced game engine , but you know what ? I can't tell !! I actually think Black Ops 2 looked better all the way around and that was running on my 360..Now like I said it is not a bad looking game but you can tell its not quite what it should be.

Multiplayer :

This is not the best or the worst COD multiplayer to date. In my opinion Modern Warfare 3 is the absolute worst  multiplayer of the whole series..  the developers of this game ( infinityward ) have been falling apart since cod modern warfare ( cod 4 ).. since then its been a down hill slide. Now the other development team Treyarch has really stepped up their game and given us really good COD games every other year. I actually can't wait to see what they bring us in November this year..

Bottom line is that you might be disappointed with this game if you drop 50 to 60 bucks on it.. its not bad but at the same time its not as good as previous entries into the series .

There are tons of things that need to be revised for the potential sequel. A few glaring problems I see (mainly when playing against cpu on Hard or Pro):

- Punches and kicks are slowww. Try to throw a combo in the game. The movement is like wading through muddy water. Also, most of the time the striking feels really weak. Doesn't matter if you land a clean head kick, flying knee, etc. Your opponent doesn't even flinch most of the time unless you hit them with a parry + counter shot.

- Speaking of parrying. Most of the time, the game ends up in a stupid parry battle back and forth. CPU also seems to lands these in succession much easier than you, even when you can swear you were holding the buttons.

- Clinch game is terrible. I remember reading in hands-on previews before launch that this wasn't even built yet for many demos, which tells me it was broken and thrown in last. It shows.

- No event mode, PPV, tournament mode, etc. Bare bones game. Career mode feels bare and unfinished.

- Movement needs to be much more fluid. In many instances, my opponent is rocked and stumbling backwards, but I move the exact same speed forward as they do backwards, giving them time to recover. They patched this, so you run at your opponent throwing punches, but it doesn't really work too well and definitely does not happen each time the opponent is rocked.

- This game begs to have sliders put in! Speed, punching power, damage, submission speed, etc could all be on sliders, giving players control on how they want to play the game.

The good is simple, everything you liked about Arkham City as far as game play goes, is back in full force and no one should be disappointed. How it all gels together though is to be desired.
Now for the bad:

Story:

Now, my favourite aspect of a game's story is the level of urgency (hence why Bioshock 1 is my least favourite of the 3 and why I just never got into the Last of Us (and probably wouldn't care much for 2 souls)). I don't feel the initial rush I felt in either Asylum or City. Man, those games were great at the beginning, so immersive. This one left me a bit in the cold (HA! Cause it's winter...). The story seemed hap hazard, which makes sense for a more open world game. This game, more unlike the other two, wants to be an open world game where you are Batman doing whatever Batman has to do, confronting a bunch of villains a night. I prefer stories where the city is actually at stake, rather than my own life (or rather, Batman's life). This game is more personal and more akin to an open world game like Skyrim than a metroid vania type game with a singular story.

I absolutely LOVED it in City, when Hugo Strange executed his protocol and you had no choice but to follow the story line. And of course you (well, I) would, because there is no way Batman would go around beating some thugs up or trying to capture Hush when there are helicopters shooting bombs on everyone. That rush was insane. And yes, it was crafted that way. The game wanted me stop strange at that moment. In Arkham Origins, there is a scene where people are held hostage and batman tells Alfred he has to handle it first before doing anything else. There was great immediacy. But then I realized I didn't have to help right away. I could scan some tagged buildings or take out one of Enigma's networks. Even while on the actual mission, I can just do whatever I want when I want to.

A copy paste of Arkham City with focus on open world becomes tedious

My complaints are on this game having a different intention than the previous where it is trying to be more of a grand theft auto game. HOWEVER, if it is to have different intentions, then why is it a copy paste of the other games? Especially City. This angers me to no end. Yes, I agree, the riddler trophies in City may have been tedious, but I didn't see it that way then. I needed this game to see it, and you know why? Because it's the same thing. Everything has been copy pasted. Instead of Zsaz making you travel to a location, you have Anarky. Instead of riddler trophies, you have data packs (Which make no sense story wise), instead of riddler signs that only get revealed with detective vision (my personal favourite from Azylum), you have Anarcky tags (why would he use invisible ink to tag big buildings to show that he's an activist, isn't that counter intuitive?), instead of Venom containers, you have Black Mask drug containers (I think), DeadShot is still just a sidequest like before (after all that marketing, really?), instead of TIGER Cameras, you have Riddler network servers/modems/antennas and the list goes on. And it's not only that, but the city itself is a copy paste. Arkham City taught us that a section of gotham was closed off to make the prison, but this game tells us that it was all of the upper half. How does that make any sense? Wasn't it boarded up by a giant wall? Wouldnt the upper half of this game's city extend beyond the Arkham City map? I am realizing just how great the island of Arkham Azylum was. There were no invisible walls; you simply could not get beyond the island. It was its own little open world with urgency that could not be avoided and you never felt like you were missing out on a bigger city or other areas, and you never noticed the limitations of having it on that island because everything was made accessible.

Less attention to the city itself

My other big negative point is how this city feels less alive than Arkham City. It made sense to just have thugs around Arkham City, since the city was all prisoners. But Arkham Origins has the same thing and yet, this isn't a prison. The theme made the constancy of thugs and villains make sense, but here is feels shallow and more like a copy paste of what was found in City. Arkham City had amazing details. Remember that Museum? Now contrast that with Penguin's ship. What was ""penguin"" about it? What made the casino so unique that it could only exist in Batman's world? I remember complaining a bit that Arkham City didn't have much detail in the city (all buildings, stairways, windows looked the same), but the chaos splatterred all over it (like riddler marks on the Church's gargoyles and Two Face wrecking half of the court house and Joker adding clowns all over the steel mill) makes that game jump leaps and bounds over Arkham Origins. It just doesnt feel lived in, by its villains or its people.

I remember promising Freeze to find his wife and finding her, randomly as I was investigating around. She was held captive by the Joker's thugs. I went to see freeze and he got there by creating an ice bridge over the water which you could now use. And then, when you go back to the location, you can see him reunited with her AND scan them to answer a riddle. Sure, that last part makes no sense, but it was just an extra reward for seeing where the game would go with that extra mission (which at first didn't feel like a mission since it was truly optional). Things like this made the gaming experience feel so much more organic instead of by  the numbers, which is what this game feels like. It wants to include everything City had, making sure you have enough things to do, and makes it dull. I already played City, 2.5 times, I don't need to play it again. So there you go, this is my true criticism.

Gameplay changes

As a technical standpoint, I have no objections now that I fixed my settings (the game keeps going back to default physcs which makes my game so slow, and I didn't know). The framerate is good and the fighitng is better than ever. I like how hard it is now. I have to strange my strategy and be more defensive. I actually gain my first special by just blocking. And I HAVE to figure out how to dodge knives. They always mess me up. In City, I could just jump over the guy, but not anymore. The AI is very agressive and it feels great now that my framerate is good. As far as graphics, it just looks like City, but less lived in. Batman looks great though. I have loved all his costumes so far. And I like Deathstroke's costume too, I like all the costumes. I never minded any of the character interpretations in the batman games.

Now onto the good...

While I complain about the writing, I must admit that the last 2 hours are probably the best in any Batman game. It is very batman like and has that villain interaction we always love. I did not expect it and it makes a nice bow on the series. Hopefully that isn't too much of a spoiler. But man, that urgency finally comes full force, way better than any of the previous ones. I guess it took a while for this game to get to me, but it did.

So, after liking this game in the end, what about New Game Plus?

Well, remember I said this game makes me look like a manic depressive... I was so pumped that I wanted more and since I had not found all the riddler stuff and was slowly getting into it (I did not care to investigate his base till late in the game and then found it interesting), I did the same that I did in City and started new game plus. In Arkham City, I would just replay the game ad when I would see something that I couldn't access before, I would then have the gadgets to access these parts. It didn't matter much in Azylum since the map was smaller but back tracking in City just for riddler trophies would have been a bit much.

BUT GUESS WHAT: new game plus DOES NOT give you all your gadgets. You have all your gadget upgrades but not your gadgets. So you unlock the gadgets just as you did in the original capaign and then you have the upgrades already available as soon as you get the gadgets. But you still start the game the very same way. So now new game plus seems much less inticing, especially since there are some sidequests I don't care to redo (the way the Bane sidequest in City was handled was pretty genius, there is no ingenuit here). So yeah, the story and writing is a plus to this series (the great finale) and so are the better boss fights. But everything else is inferior to Arkham City, too bad. Dammit, now I regret preordering it, especially with all the bugs on PC. That will teach me (still preordering Bioshock games though, the Ken Levine places PC first, awesome).

Hmmm, wait, maybe that isn't quite true, but then again... eh.  Yeah, 3 stars is stretching it a bit.  This doesn't quite hit ""I Like It"" territory, but then it doesn't completely fail either.  Just a middle of the road offering in too many ways to truly count, though I'll include a couple here.

First up, the graphics on the PS4 edition aren't bad.  In some ways they are pretty impressive, but then... oh, yeah, then.  There's the coaches walking around on the sidelines doing an ""Aw, shucks..."" type motion.  (For example Shanahan from the Redskins)  It just looks so cheesy and unimpressive and so cartoonish to be laughable and irritating.

There's also the repetitive block of characters that are seen in the end zone when a field goal is being attempted.  Shown behind the ""screen"" or ""net"" so as to make it look more realistic, except, well it doesn't look that way at all.  The fans there are moving in blocks that repeat so much as to also be distracting, making it obvious that you are playing a ""video game"" rather than something that might be considered a somewhat realistic simulation of the NFL game.

The graphics also lead one to believe, as they have over the last few years of Madden games, that players don't just turn on a dime, but can quickly slide the lower portion of their bodies left or right in an instant and then be off to the races as they dart around on the field.  Unrealistic to the point of being laughable again.  Yes, I know there are players that can spin move, juke, and leave the defensive players with egg on their faces, but it isn't nearly as many of them as we see in this game on a yearly basis.

Something I do like is that it does seem that EA's team has gotten the audio team involved in the production of this game.  Scoring a TD for the Redskins (as an example) results in hearing 'Hail to the Redskins' sung by the crowd as one would actually hear at FedEx field (or hear on the TV broadcast those times when the Redskins actually do score TDs this season :-p :-D )  That does tend to add back in a little more realism, but it hardly makes up for the other places where Madden NFL 25 just doesn't quite shine.

In the end, like others, I long for the time when there is no more exclusivity for NFL football games on console systems (or elsewhere) as I would like to think that competition would lead to better games for everyone to enjoy.  Fan boys of the Madden series will surely enjoy this game.  Others will likely wish for something different.

If you haven't played the previous games, this is a very good game. Works perfectly, controls are great. Amazing party game and nothing to complain about. Good amount of song variety, no bugs, great graphics, tight controls, very good re-playability with various modes like non-stop work out etc. and every thing you expect from the series.

I own Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters for the original Xbox, Fable: The Lost Chapters for PC, and Fable II and Fable III for Xbox 360, so I figured I needed Fable Anniversary since it's a classic, in my opinion, and the best Fable of the bunch.

While the game is gorgeous overall, it does show its age in some aspects such as character model graphics and whatnot, but I always saw Fable as being a more whimsical, cartoony game, so the graphics are more than fitting. The environments, however, look better than ever.

As for the gameplay, it's still the same as the original, so expect an RPG that's friendly for everyone.

Sadly, Fable Anniversary is incredibly buggy. And do note that I'm a very forgiving person, and I really never run into bugs in so-called buggy games, but Fable Anniversary is the exception. While it's still an absolutely stellar game, the fact that it'll freeze -- and it does so very often -- ruins it quite a bit.

5,True,"02 21, 2014",A3DMOPD7P7WJMC,B00DC7O77A,SavageLove,"It is here, Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze! So far, it is an excellent game. Here is my initial review of the game so far. Ive completed level one to bring you this review as soon as possible after waiting until 1PM for the UPS guy to deliver it. I might come back to add to the review once Ive beaten the game to give more details about how many levels and sublevels there are.

There are some SPOILERS, so be warned!
.
.
Game Files: There are three of them like always. It tells you what level you are standing on, how much of the game you have completed and how many lives you have. Clicking on one brings you to a scroll that has you choose between playing on the TV or the Gamepad. Then you select one or two player (second player controls Diddy, Dixie or Cranky).

Story: I like this story, which is not just the They stole our bananas, get them! story we usually see in the DK Country series. I like that there are invaders and there is no mention of stolen bananas anywhere. I think this adds to the game, making it more interesting. Basically, invaders from the artic kick the Kongs out of their home and make it an icy place. I like it.

Starting the Game: When you start a new file, it immediately goes into a cut scene. The cut scene is the trailer where you see DKs birthday party but with some more added on. You start the very first level right away (wont tell you how ) so be prepared to take action.

Controls: I have only used the Gamepad so far and will try out the other controllers later. But, the controls feel good. They are not awkward at all and you get used to what button does what pretty quickly. Heres how they work: Just DK: A/B jump, X/Y ground pound, X/Y + left or right is rolling, ZR/ZL grabbing. With Diddy and Dixie Kong holding A/B becomes hover mode, while tapping the A/B button twice then holding with Cranky lets you jump higher on his cane (but you cant jump and then do it, it won't work). With all three, pressing R/L when the meter to the left gets full causes them to high five and kill enemies around you by turning them into life balloons, hearts (red or gold), coins or bananas. You can use the left C-stick (the right one does nothing) or the D-pad to move around. Im assuming that the Pro Controller is the same while the Wii Remote/Nunchuk will include some motion control like in DK Country Returns.

Touch Controls: There are no touch controls. You cannot touch anything on the Gamepad, even in the menu, to do something. Im a little used to New Super Mario Bros. U and Super Mario 3D World which uses touch controls for some things. That is a little disappointing. They have this touch screen device and they should have used it!

Music: Like always, the music is upbeat and fun, even when things get a little hairy. Outside of the level, the music is pretty loud, but you can kind of hear the background noise of the island you are on. You can change this in the options. There is also some retro music from the original DK Country, won't tell you where, youll have to find it for yourself! But even then, the music reminds me of the music in the original DK Country.

Graphics: The cut scene graphics are very detailed. You can the individual hairs on DKs arms blowing in the wind! Everything looks great. I have seen no pixilation anywhere. Even the DK you play is very detailed.  Id say the graphics are a lot better than DK Country Returns. For instance, the water in and out of the level looks so real. The graphics have gone up a lot.

Map Layout: You remember in DK Country Returns how there was a coin with DKs picture on it instead of there being the actual characters running around on the lap like all the other had games? That is gone and DK and Diddy are back to walking around on the map. The layout is much like the New Super Mario Bros. U map with uncompleted sublevels being red and completed being blue, and with forks in the path you travel on. Although, I do wish DK would pound his chest and yell when you leave him alone for a while on the map like he did in DK Country. He just seems to bob along to the music. I like this layout better than DK Country Returns. It kind of has the same feel as the original, if you know what I mean.

Candy Kong and Save Points: Shes not here, again. There is no need for her since you don't have to beat a boss or a certain level to save your game. It automatically saves every level you beat, so you do not need to worry about losing your progress when you quit. But, Ive always liked Candy Kong Save Points, I wished theyd bring her back like in the first DK Country where once you get to her in a level, you can go back to her time and again to save. But, oh well, maybe next time shell be back.

Level Starts: A scroll appears with two optionsPlay Level and Inventory. Yall know what Play Level means (it does lead to another scroll that has you confirm that you want to play a level or not). Inventory is new. Apparently you can choose three items to take with you that you buy from Funky Kong.

Time Attacks: When you have completed a level and replay it, there is now another optiontime attacks. You go back and try to beat the level within a set time limit. There are three, the fastest gets you the gold, the second silver and the third bronze. What happens is that your score is then sent to the leaderboards online for everyone to look at. Time attacks are hard. I have yet to even get a bronze medal for level 1.1. But it is fun to try.

Check Points: Again, this is run by a pig instead of breaking open a barrel. I don't get it. No, seriously, what it with the pig? If they wanted to put someone there for the mid-level check points, why not have Candy Kong? When you die and come back at a checkpoint or even the beginning of the level before you have reached a checkpoint, you float down on a balloon. Thats cool, but I liked when he used to burst out of the barrels.

Collecting Items: Bananas- Like always, get a hundred bananas you get a life. Sometimes, when you collect a group of individual bananas in a level they turn into a coin. Coins-  You use them to buy items for your inventory. Puzzle pieces- I have no idea what happens, I have never collected all of them before. KONG- Collect the letters and you get a life. I kinda like how they added the coins and puzzle pieces because it gives you more to do in a level.

Bonus Games: Collect all the banana you get a puzzle piece, a red balloon and a coin. Theyre a little hard than previous games.

Lives in the Level: Like in DK Returns, you get two hearts with DK and four with DK and Diddiy/Dixie/Cranky. You lose two hearts with Diddiy/Dixie/Cranky, they take off. With Dixie, when you do the L/R high five slap, enemies turn into gold hearts which gives you an extra hit.

Level Endings: A barrel overs in midair and has several items whirling by. You hit it to get an item and that ends the level. Hit a banana, you press X/Y quickly to get as many as you can. After that happens, you see the characters on a pedestal next to a results scroll that show you if you collected all of the KONG letters and puzzle pieces. Its more interesting that running into a cave at the end. Also note, like with Mario games, some levels have more than one exit. I like that, because it makes you explore the level instead of rushing through it.

Water Warning Spoiler: You know back in the day when characters could breathe underwater for forever? You never had to worry about how quickly you were going or having to get something to give you more time. Not anymore. DK has an air indication next to where the lives are, run out and you die. You gotta get to air bubbles to refresh the indicator. Im not sure if I like this. But, DK swims like a champ, much better than in the original.

Enemies: There are new enemies in this game, just like there were in DK Country Returns. A few of the enemies don't make sense to me. The invaders are creatures from icy climates, yet you have some birds and bugs that seem out of place. But I like the new enemies, they are different from the other games which is refreshing.

Funky Kong: Hes here and hes huge, like, as big as DK! Didnt he used to be a skinny dude? Whatever. His plane is back, but you don't hop on it to get to another island, but instead, you can buy stuff from him. Green Balloons (will sometimes save you when you fall) or Blue Balloons (extra air), a bird (finds puzzle pieces), a shield (protection), a bottle (makes you temporarily invincible), heart (extra health), Diddy Kong/Dixie Kong/Cranky Kong Barrels (lets you start a level with them or the appear if you lose the one you have). And you can collect toys.

I love the DK Country series. The only one I never got was the N64 game because I could never find it. A lot of things are the same, some have been lost, and a lot has been added. The game is fun and I cant wait to get further along. It is a great addition to the series and if you love DK, youll love the game.","Not a They stole our bananas, get them! story, it's even BETTER!",1392940800,3,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I have a few issues however -

- My biggest issue is online chat. You CANNOT chat in game with your mic and headset, not even with friends. You can only chat with friends in lobbies before the race starts. You can't chat with unconfirmed friends at all. This is extremely dissapointing. While I understand Nintendo wanting to stay family friendly, there is no excuse for them not atleast allowing chat in game with  friends. This is 2014, get with the times Nintendo.

- No battle arenas for battle mode, you simply battle on the tracks which is silly as they are far too large and you end up just driving around aimlessly trying to find people. This essentially means there is no battle mode in Mario Kart 8.

Not just fr their video games, but the longevity of the characters from start to finish. That has shown itself from Mario to Zelda, all the way to classics like Donkey Kong and Star Fox. But overall, it is the longevity and appeal that has shown even with companies like Sony, Sega and Microsoft trying their hands to match what Nintendo has done, it is the classics that have stood the test of time. It nearly has been twenty years since Nintendo has unveiled the Nintendo 64, and great definitive titles like Super Mario 64, The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time and Star Fox 64 have been the definitive templates of gaming history. Super Smash Brothers has also been a massive part of the definitive, influential system. When it came out, it really grabbed the gamers' hearts and controllers. It has had great sequels that have been worth the money, Super Smash Brothers Melee for the Gamecube, Brawl for the Wii in 2008 as well. Now, the definitive fighter is taking the gaming world on the go, and it is worth it.

Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo 3DS really shows that Nintendo still has some lengths, considering the lag of strong games for the 3DS the past year. It is a great game as you take on fighters from Mario, Yoshi, Bowser, and all your favorite Nintendo classics and try to fight your way to the top, as you fight, kick, and punch through so many levels of the Nintendo Universe, to master and defeat the great Master Hand and score through so many great levels of fun. Graphically, it definitely holds up, and the controls are strong and remain tight. What also holds up in the game is the great online gaming as you can also fight with others well through the Nintendo streetpass, and clubhouse worldwide gameplay. The game also has new characters who have also joined on the smashing fun with Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy and the classic Pac-Man chomping his way to the top of the leaderboard. The sound also is just as strong as the console greats that have been with the Nintendo systems before.

Overall, what you get with Super Smash Brothers for the Nintendo 3DS is a great game that isn't just fun, it stands tall with the great 3DS titles from before that have been definitive from Super Mario 3D Land, Mario Kart 7 and Yoshi's New Island. It really is a fantastic game that holds up so well in so many ways, graphically, control and enjoyment. If you have never owned a Nintendo 3DS title before, this is absolutely one I recommend you go to. For anyone that has followed Super Smash Brothers before, this is definitely up to the best that Nintendo has shown before in great games.

3,True,"04 4, 2016",A312ZY7Y941JVA,B00DDXILBQ,Ray C.,"Preface: This review contains spoilers and relates to the current state of the game.

The Basics: The Division is a 3rd person shooter with the character builds of an RPG. The game centers around the player finding items to increase their in-game skills based on statistics from the items they pick up. There are two different types of activities to achieve this, PvE (Player versus Environment) and PvP (Player versus Player). In other words, it's a game that requires grinding (repetition of the same tasks for the aim of finding better items, similar to Destiny and Borderlands in that aspect). The story is a typical apocalypse setting where a virus is transmitted through the touch of money on Black Friday and now a skilled set of agents called ""The Division"" are tasked to put things back together.

My Thoughts: After putting in a few days worth of play time, I personally feel bored with the game. Let me try to explain what I mean,

1st Goal - Max out your character rank which is 30 ranks. This will probably take an average casual player a day's worth of playtime or so to achieve. The 30 ranks is strictly PvE activities only and will be depicted as an orange bar at the top right hand side of your screen.
Side Goal - As you rank up in PvE, you can eventually access the PvP mode which is labeled ""Dark Zone"" on the map. Consider this area a lawless area where you can engage in any type of combat. If you choose to shoot other players, you will be considered ""Rogue"" and all other players in your lobby will be gunning for you. There are also environmental enemies that are not real people shooting at you as well. You will receive a rank in the Dark Zone as well which can go much higher than 30 and this will be depicted by a purple bar that will show up under the orange bar when you are inside the Dark Zone. The best way to approach this area is to head in as soon as you can as you will be pitted against other real players of similar PvE ranks (orange bar ranks). The way the lobbies are set is based on both your PvE rank and your DZ (Dark Zone) rank. So if you decide to head into the DZ at rank 30, you will be pitted against other rank 30 players making you more vulnerable to stronger players. Once you reach rank 30 in the DZ, you will have access to better items from loot-able chests and special vendors. It's worthwhile to mention that every time you die in the DZ, you will lose rank progression, so be careful and make wise decisions!
2nd Goal - Once your character hits 30, the game will introduce you to what is called ""end-game"" activities. This means you can replay missions for better rewards and special in-game credits that will allow you to purchase better items from in-game vendors. The problem here is there is a substantial exploit that can be used to make the process to quicker and if you don't exploit it, it will take you 12x longer to achieve (not joking). I'll explain. There is a mode called ""Challenging"" that takes about 2 hours (if not more) to finish for the average player. 4-man team, replaying a mission on a very difficult setting (it's no joke). Then, there's the exploit: loading the server with more than 4 players of which yielded me with a 16-man team and my team and I were able to finish the mission in 10 minutes or less. So it's either a grueling hours long task for very little or a monotonous repetition of the same task for easy end-game credits (Phoenix Credits) and more items than you can hold after 5 or so runs.

This game has a road map of additional content on the way so repeating the 2nd Goal is a priority to prepare your character for the challenging activities ahead, but the main problem is an unbalance of the activities at hand for the average-skilled solo player. Playing through the main story and ranking to 30 was very enjoyable to me due to the casualness of the activities, but the end-game activities are either boring (if you exploit) or take up too much time (finding a random group and hoping you'll finish the activity in a timely manner). As for the Dark Zone, it's an activity that is heavily in favor of well established groups. There are those brave souls who go in solo and can handle themselves, but I'm convinced that very few are able to do it. Not an enjoyable experience if you don't group up with other players that you work well with.

Conclusion: The game play is great, the RPG aspect is great, and graphics are great, but the grind is boring, takes up a lot of time, and hard to find a group that works well. Unless you have a set group of friends to play with or you're a boss at solo-ing, you're not missing out on too much.",Review from an Avid Solo Player,1459728000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

4,False,"03 16, 2016",A2D5RNPVBSM2SP,B00DEL3IIS,Tom,"I'm really enjoying this game. Yes, it could be better, and isn't quite deserving of a 5 star rating. The story and lore aren't all that compelling, it's highly repetitive, and it's essentially a gear grind.  There are also bugs, but that's all forgivable because the game is just a LOT of fun to play, especially with friends.

The Division is basically a massively multiplayer super serious 3rd person Borderlands with cover shooting. Like Borderlands, you're constantly getting loot that is just a tiny bit better than what you had before--and when you do get that one item that is a substantial upgrade it makes you feel elated and eager to try it out on mobs that once pummeled you before. Satisfying progression is the corner stone of MMOs, and this game pulls it off well.

It also pulls off some incredible weather effects. You'll step into a mission for an hour, come back outside and the zone you were in is now dense with fog, snow blowing all over the place. It has a real effect on combat, too, because it's more difficult to see the enemies. Lighting is great, environmental detail is outstanding, and the level of interactivity with objects is impressive for a MMO.

But, it's about as much of a MMO as Destiny was--maybe even less so. You won't just stumble into a random stranger unless you're in the designated player vs. player area (the ""dark zone""). You have to first group with them in one of many hubs (think Guild Wars) and then you can go off into the world and complete tasks together. So the world itself is largely instanced, yet very solo/hermit friendly. You'll have a tougher time going at it alone, but it's entirely possible. However, I'd advise against this because--similar to Borderlands--while it's a great multiplayer game it's pretty dull when you're all by your lonesome.

If you're feeling particularly adventurous you can enter the dark zone, where you'll find all sorts of moral debauchery as well as the best loot in the game. This is where the real heart of the game lies, in my opinion. If a player attacks another player a bounty is placed and they are tagged as a rogue agent, and everyone in their vicinity can wreak havoc on them freely, as well as steal the gear they've obtained from high level mobs in the dark zone. Because in this zone the gear you pick up isn't really yours until you've loaded it up on a chopper at an extraction point, where it's then sent off to be decontaminated. It's a very clever mechanic that makes sense and keeps you on your toes, because if you die while carrying contaminated gear, you could lose it for good if you don't run back to your corpse in time.

It reminds me of MMOs of old, when players could kill you at any time and loot your corpse of all your hard-earned items. But here, you're less likely to want to jump off a cliff when that happens because you only lose your contaminated gear. It's a pretty good balance between old school hardcore and modern handholding. You're of course going to run into jerks here and there, maybe even a group of them, all trying their hardest to make your life miserable.  I have no problem with this; it's this kind of random player interaction and emotional rage that creates memories and stories worth telling. It's the reason why DayZ was so successful. And it's horribly enjoyable to partake in from time to time. Since rogue agents are marked on the map for the whole vicinity of players to reign death upon, their killing streak never lasts too long.

If none of that sounds like your thing, you don't have to ever go in there. Simple.

There's a lot more I could say about the game, and time will tell how the game will transform once the DLC comes out, but for now I'll just say it's definitely been worth the purchase. It exceeded my fairly low expectations, and although it's certainly not a masterpiece, it's the most fun game of its kind that I've played in quite awhile and really pushes things forward in the genre. I like it much more than Destiny, much more than Borderlands. That crack drip progression is all there, and I've been having a difficult time pulling myself away from the world.

4,False,"12 5, 2014",A7HDIBPWU66SR,B00DHF3BZQ,new Tron,"It's been a long time since the console gaming world has seen a survival horror game like The Evil Within. Firmly rooted in its Resident Evil 4 gameplay DNA, The Evil Within feels like that classic masterpiece crossed with the psychological horrors of the early Silent Hill games and the tense, something-is-out-there feeling of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Just like it takes elements from the best horror games of the past to create something new, it does this in its horror style too, taking strong influence from the supernatural Japanese style of horror seen in films such as Ju-On and Ringu, mixed with the brutal, Western torture-porn style of film of something like Saw. It's a potent mix of intensity and fear that never seems at odd with its disparate elements.

The powerful hardware of the Playstation 4 helps bring the visual style of these horror elements to life in a way that has never been seen in a horror game before. Boasting some of the most impressive lighting ever seen in a game, environments are cold, dank, and ominous in a way they could never be before. Blood shimmers on meat hooks, and pools of sludge containing unknown ingredients disgustingly ripple as Sebastian, the main character, wades through them. Moonlight eerily illuminates villages containing crazed maniacs around every corner. Even the game's ""hub"", where you save your game and upgrade your character's abilities, is an old, abandoned hospital that creaks and echos with your every step. In short, the environments of The Evil Within are absolutely stellar. They are quite possibly the game's greatest strength, and set a new standard for the survival horror genre.

What really makes The Evil Within special, and what, oddly enough, may be the biggest turn off for many gamers, is the gameplay. In an age where video game characters are powerful beings who shred through hundreds of enemies with ease, The Evil Within puts you in command of a fragile, weak character who is often times one round of ammunition away from dying. Like Harry Mason from Silent Hill, Sebastian is out of breath quickly after a short run. He takes huge amounts of damage every time he's hit by an enemy. And at first, his skill with weapons is pretty low. Not only is your character itself weak, but the gameplay itself works to enhance this feeling. The camera is frantic when enemies move in close, and it never lets you see too much of what's around you, just like in real life. People have called this a technical flaw in the game's design, but I don't believe this to be the case. I believe it serves to increase the game's tension, and as the player develops more skill playing this challenging game, they are forced into playing the game more intelligently to avoid these situations. The game has an amazing sense of balance to it, always giving the player the means to succeed and forge onward while never giving them enough power so that they lose their sense of vulnerability. This balance is key to The Evil Within's success, and is a clear indication of the genius of the game's legendary director, Shinji Mikami.

This game is true, old school survival horror, and is really the type of game that will only be appreciated by players with the fortitude to play by its rules. This is easily the best game of its kind since the original Dead Space, and compared to that masterpiece, The Evil Within is much more unforgiving and captures the essence of survival much more than Dead Space did.

After receiving countless emails from ZOS about how they're changing the game, overhauling everything to do with endgame, making it more accessible to everyone, they left in the Veteran Rank system for the console launch, the ONE THING that caused the mass exodus of PC players.

Why I didn't like it:
Although the game looks great, it plays just like every other major shooter I've experienced.

The single player campaign is short and just kind of uninspired.  You're supposed to be in charge of the unit for much of the game, but Irish is clearly the boss and you are powerless to make any decisions.

The environment is fairly static with the exception of the building that collapses in the first ""17 minutes"" of the game which was seemingly designed as a prolonged trailer for marketing purposes.

The multiplayer is a big disorganized mess and objectives offer no immediate rewards or consequences.  It's all a giant team deathmatch and with so many players in a match you are basically just one of the crowd unless you are one of the hardcore players who is fully dedicated to the game.  I know this experience is pretty much present in any online multiplayer but the map designs and player capacity of BF4 make the issue feel worse than ever.  It feels so much like the rat race that video games are supposed to offer us relief from.

Whether this game is better or worse than COD Ghosts I don't know or care.  The fact that the two are considered rivals makes me certain that I do not want to play COD at all.

I would've given this one star, but I found it to be more fun than Killzone Shadow Fall so I had to give it some credit.  I just wish that we as consumers could get the developers of these major shooter franchises to break the mold a little bit and change things up in the 5th, 6th, or 7th version of the games they made back in 2007/2008.

The original Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 game is a masterpiece for the most part... but this DLC? not so much... The DLC adds a new boss battle,new playable character, 100 battle challenge mode, some enhanced visuals and some unlockable images.. and that's it.. not really worth it and i'll tell you why..
the Challenge missions are fun, and what you'll spend most of your time with since it's the only new content that takes time to beat.

The ""New Chapter"" is misleading.. it's not a new chapter it's just an impossible to win, complete unfair, frustraing boss battle with you playing as Itachi and Sasuke against the Sage Mode form of Kabuto. Kabuto has 2 battles.. the first one is winnable but the second  he has  5, yes 5 health bars! that take little damage which drags the battle out for a while. If you fail, and you will fail.. every time.. you can have to restart the battle at the second part of the battle where he gains his 5 health bars, but the difficulty remains the same, instead of of being lowered so you can win it like in the other boss battles from the original Naruto Shippuden UNS 3 game did... essentially, not matter how good you get.. the boss battle isn't winnable and is extremely frustrating..

The ""HD Visuals"" that were supposedly enhanced for the Burst DLC  aren't a mixture of visuals that only look slightly better, some blurry ones that actually look worse the the original's graphics, and ones that looks the same and were untouched.

The only other good thing about the DLC besides the Challenge missions is the ""new"" character Sage Mode Kabuto ( i say ""new"" because he could have had sage mode as an awakened form (and probably did at some point in the game's production before it was presumably was put on hold in order to make more money and release it as DLC) he is a good new character.. but $10 for one character and some quick challenge missions isn't really worth it.. even if you get the retail version which includes the all the DLC costumes it still isn't worth it since the costumes are just cosmetic.

 So to recap.. one new character. an impossible, frustrating boss battle. partially enhanced ( and partially worse) visuals, new challenge mode for $10 is a rip off big time.. don't bother getting the DLC unless you just want Sage Mode Kabuto are willing to pay $10 for one character..",Interesting DLC but not worth it,1391904000,2,{'Platform:': ' Sony Playstation 3'},

1.  The voice acting is awful.  When I first started playing Lego games, I wondered if the sound was screwed up since the characters didn't talk.  I realize pretty quickly that it would have detracted from the games to put voice actors in there.  With the iconic roles that were being taken on, there really was no point in trying to have someone ""do"" a voice.
2.  The dialogue was also pretty bad.  Iron Man kept spouting stupid lines like ""Oh Yeah"" for no particular reason.  The Sandman kept making the same awful jokes over and over.  I have nothing against awful jokes, but going back to the voice acting, they just weren't said with any conviction.
3.  Controls are hard, IMO.  I swear I was pressing square to fire/throw something and it just wasn't happening.
4.  It was hard to figure out what to do even with the non-stop prompts.  For example, there was a place where Bruce Banner had to jump on a web thread.  But, if you weren't lined up exactly right it wouldn't work.  Maybe that's more of a control compliant.

So just take that into consideration when deciding about a purchase.

I've played through several of these games (LEGO Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Pirates, etc) and this one is hands down the best of them all.  Yes you've got to grind to unlock all the characters.  Yes you've got to backtrack into previously visited areas to get everything.  Yes you're building and destroying things.  But what sets this game apart on the PS4 is...

- Graphically it's the most beautiful looking of all the LEGO games (yes, it should be!).  The cutscenes are great and witty, and the special powers of the characters are faithfully transitioned.
- Gameplay-wise, as I said above, it's the same as all the other LEGO games, the ""twist"" being in this one that the various superpowers change how you can get through the levels.  I STRONGLY recommend the guide with this game if you are a completionist type, as there are places you will get plenty stuck otherwise.

The graphics look really good, controls are easy to learn, and it has cast members from the Ducktales show, which is a great addition to this game.  The game isn't insanely hard, but it sure does have a good amount of challenge in it's platforming.  While the story isn't anything too special, it does have some funny moments in it.  If there is one thing I'll say about this game, it's that it is not best played on a keyboard, so I recommend anybody to use a 360 controller or a PS3 controller with MotioninJoy, whichever option is more accessible.

Great packaging, neat concept, minimalist design ... lots of stuff that could have gone right for the product.  As far as using it for any type of gesture motion control to control  your computer - PLEASE do not count on it.

I am primarily a Mac user (but tried it on a PC too as well).  As far as platforms go, the device worked with both of them without much difference between them.

This is a piece of hardware that hits the gadget geeks like myself right in the sweet spot conceptually.  Unfortunately, there is a bit of learning curve involved.  It isn't about removing it from the box, setting it up and having it work.  It takes time to discover what the functional motions will be.  Even after tutorials and practice, the device is a bit of a loose cannon as it does not seem to work with a lot of consistency.

I expected, as so many others have, that this might help to improve productivity ... but it just can't at this stage.  It's not even as fun as it could be because it's difficult to get any consistency out of.  I've tried various placements, bare hands and arms (no cuffs or jewelry) and it still seems like a far cry from where it needs to be.

Yes, the Leap Motion is indeed new and cool technology.  But a little too new and it's cool-factor is lost very quickly once you realize that there is a huge amount of error and lack of precision.  The plus side is that applications are being built for the software through the ""Airspace"" store.  You can expect to pay for most of them though!  There are free apps such as ""Cut The Rope"" but expect to go through some mighty frustrating motions to play that came.  This device is not going to give you the ""Minority Report"" experience you might have expected (I had honestly hoped for that too).

To me, the hardware is cool and minimalist and affordable.  Unfortunately, it just does not seem ready for primetime yet.  Leap Motion has left me quite unimpressed.",Meh.  Lacks precision .... frustrating even for the gadget geeks!,1374883200,66,,

2,False,"11 19, 2013",A2XNOB1T796Y6B,B00EALIPAC,ChibiNeko,"If you're expecting a game that will overcome all of the issues of its predecessor and provide a better product, then look elsewhere. This game was a pretty big disappointment, given the relatively small amount of hype that was being drummed up for it. The flaws of the first game mostly centered around it being an incredibly short game that was a little too repetitive at times. I had enough fun with this that I decided that I would get the next game upon its release, a decision that was helped along with the urging of my eldest nephew, who really wanted both AT games. So based upon this, I decided to give him a little thrill and shell out the bucks for the collector's edition and present him with a little something extra.

I'll go into the collector's set first, as the actual game review might take a little longer. This was only about $10 extra and I'll be honest and say that it isn't the best collector's set I've ever received. Other than a really adorable BMO box, this is a fairly bare bones collector's edition. You get the box, a DVD, the game (obviously), and a little game guide booklet that goes over the basic bonuses and characters. It's not bad enough that I feel cheated over the extra $10, but I do think that there could have been maybe one or two more small things that would really make me feel like I was getting something extra special. The game was sealed in the unit in its own plastic wrap, as if it was a copy of the game you'd pick up from the shelf. I won't detract anything for that, but I did feel a little let down that the presentation wasn't a little better than just shoving in a wrapped copy of the game. Still, it is a nice case and it'll stand up to a lot of abuse.

Now to the game play. The problem with dungeon games is that ultimately they have a somewhat limited amount of game play. It's fun to a point, but there are a lot of limitations with this dungeon crawler. The most obvious problem is repetition: you spend a lot of time doing the same actions over and over again, something that was a bit of an issue with the first game. However here there's no real puzzles to be solved, just bashing monsters. I expected this to a degree since hey- it is a dungeon game- but this isn't exactly the type of game that makes you want to spend hours and hours on it.

The other big issue is that leveling up in this game is pretty difficult, as you have to pay to get your stats up. That doesn't sound bad until you realize that you only get treasure through the dungeon levels and that the amount of treasure is somewhat limited. Even then that wouldn't be awful until the moment that you go to the surface and you figure out that you're 2-3 pieces of treasure short of what you'd need to get that next stat level... and you can't keep a piece of it. No, if you don't spend it all on the surface then whatever is left over goes to BP for taxes. It's frustrating when you have various things that cost hundreds of pieces of treasure to achieve. It really puts a hamper on how much you can achieve and pretty much necessitates going back fairly far and playing over several different levels to accrue treasure.

The length seems to be the only thing that was really addressed in this game and I have to say that occasionally this game feels like a bit of a middle finger to the critics of the first one. It's longer, but there are no cool songs and given that there's little to no dialogue, we don't have as many of the cute snappy one-liners that we had in the first game. It's almost as if the game designers thought ""You guys want to have more game, we'll give you more game. 100 levels of game, so put that in your pipe and smoke it!""

Now that isn't to say that there aren't good things about this game. The graphics are still very good and it's impressive to play this in 3D mode, as you really get the depth of getting a ""god's eye view"" of the dungeon from above. When we do have dialogue, it is very cute and the opening scene was pretty appealing. I also loved that we got a choice of characters to play and that over time, that roster increases as you rescue people from the dungeon. The game play here is repetitive, but it does have its occasional moments of fun.

But in the end that isn't enough to save this game and I think that one of the criticisms for the first game applies here as well: in the end this still felt like one of those games you pay ten dollars for at the Nintendo storefront. Perhaps part of the issue here is that the 3DS version doesn't have the multi-player option, which might have made this a little more fun. But it doesn't and I can't help but feel that MP wouldn't entirely fix all of these issues even with the other versions. This is still a fundamentally flawed game. It's occasionally fun, but this was an entirely disappointing experience even by dungeon crawler standards.","Has its moments, but ultimately a disappointing followup",1384819200,14,"{'Edition:': "" Collector's"", 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}",

If you are thinking about gifting them, they are boxed in a way that is perfect for gift giving! The box is so nice I kept it for storage.

I know Turtle Beach is known for gaming headsets but they really hit it out of the park with these headphones. Sound wise, what makes these amazing are the transmitter. With it the sound is amazing! You have the surround sound button (and LED) which cycles through the sound modes, then audio, mute, chat, pairing button, and the mic. I noticed even though the sound is better with the transmitter, the range is not as good. I started getting static when I was not far from the transmitter.

I have since been using it with both iOS devices I have through the Bluetooth. Fit wise, they just fit my head at the lowest setting. However, I do have a small head. I placed them on my 4 year old daughters head and they fit her at the same setting. If you have a small head, these might not be for you. Comfort wise, after a few hours I have to remove them because there is too much pressure with the fit.

I feel I am in my own world when I have them on though! Even when I am listening to music, playing a game, or watching a movie, I have not disturbed anyone near me. I have tried to use the mic for phone calls and voice but it is a bit muffled. It is muffled on both ends which is odd because you can almost hear a pin drop when you first put them on. Speaking of, the voice that speaks to you is very loud, the one that lets you know if it is connected, disconnected, etc. I can hear it with them off my head and once I see the light flashing that they are connected is when I put them on. If you want to hear music, every layer of it, these are the headphones you want. I personally do not like a lot of bass and these do not produce much but just enough to make for a comfortable listen.

Look wise these are very attractive and I think Turtle Beach did a great job at keeping the weight down on them. However, with that, I am not crazy about the cheap white plastic around the ear pieces but think they did it since it is lightweight. They have a solid build to the rest of them though, something that you can tell will hold up over time.

The headphones also come with a nice carrying bag/pouch which has compartments inside for the included plugs. It is nice that it comes with an airplane adapter; these are the first pair of headphones to include them. Also all charging cables are included.

I have never used Turtle Beach before but must say these are incredible sound wise. Comfort, I can only handle a few hours without them hurting my ears (pressure).

So PRO: The Dpad is fantastic. I bought this for Tekken, and my execution for Electrics has gone up from about 3/10 to 8 or 9/10
For those that don't know what this means, an electric is performed with what's called a ""just frame"" - you have to hit down/forward and triangle at the exact same time.

This dpad doesn't feel soft, so it allows me to nail it nearly every time.

Wave dashing and back dash canceling is also a breeze with it now. Before, I had a hard time going from a PS1 to a PS3 pad because the dpad is softer. This is no longer the case.

That said, the buttons are VERY close to the right stick. In fact, this is made for fighting games mostly from what I've read, and the sticks are both unnecessarily high and they're in the way of the buttons. The buttons are also very high and clunky.

Turbo Feature: Is bad. It's nice to have it easy to set up, but the ""auto fire"" aspect is unnecessary.

Mouse cable is stiff plastic, instead of higher quality cloth.

The device has two modes: switching it to A mode allows it to work very well with the few Moga-enhanced games I tried it with. The real appeal of this device, however, lies in Mode B, which allows one to easily map touch controls to the buttons on the device. As such, it works perfectly and almost instantaneously with every emulator program I own.

The D-Pad, analog sticks, face buttons, and shoulder bumpers are all very responsive and comfortable to use. The only downside to this product is that the triggers on the back of the controller are gummy and unpleasant to use. This isn't a problem for me, as I don't plan on playing anything that requires the use of triggers, but it's worth keeping in mind that this might negatively influence one's experience with games that have more complex control schemes.

Both Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus had the Body Test that measured your weight, Center Of Balance and Body Mass Index.  Wii Fit U has the Body Test too, with a few added special things.  First and foremost is the Gamepad.  You can virtually use Wii Fit U with the gamepad without a television.  When it comes to the Body Test, Wii Fit U adds you personally into the mix.  Using the Gamepad camera, you are able to take a selfie of yourself.  Not only do you have the statistics, you also have your own personal images.

The Wii Fit balance board included with this package is the same as it always has been.  The other cool thing is the Wii U Fit Meter.  This meter not only interacts with Wii Fit U.  As you wear it throughout the day, it measures a myriad of things.  Steps taken and calories burned are just two of them.  When climbing stairs, the meter measures your altitude.  After each day is through, come on back to Wii Fit U and transfer your data from the meter to Wii Fit U via the infrared sensor on the gamepad.  If you need a way to do a quick Body Test and data transfer, install the Wii Fit U Quick Check on your Wii U.  I consulted Nintendo myself regarding this.  The Wii Fit U Meter can store up to twenty-eight days of data.  In other words, you can use the Wii Fit U Meter for four weeks before you would need to transfer your data.

5,False,"01 4, 2014",A393VTXSFYGMYZ,B00FM5IY0Q,Live Player,"Let me start off by saying that this game is truly gorgeous.  It is definitely a next generation game.  I first purchased COD Ghosts, and though it was marginally better than the 360 version, it didn't have that wow effect. DR3 has that WOW effect. There are hundreds of zombies on the screen at any given time, and there is no slow down in the frame rate what so ever.  Weapon combinations can now be built on the fly (before a bench was needed), and you can even build some really cool zombie-slaying vehicles too.  I have about 12 hours in, and I have to say that I look forward to playing this game everyday.  I just passed my first boss battle, and the game does a real good job of giving you the ability to explore the world.

If you have played any of the past DRs, you will know about the very limiting time system which forced you to finish tasks very quickly.  DR3 gives you the option to change game modes, so that explorers, such as myself, have plenty of time searching for trophies, and cool weapons, and side plots.

There are civilians scattered around throughout the game, and you can choose to save them or not. If you do save them, you can use them later as a companion to help you along your travels. One great thing is that you can share with your AI companion. So for instance you can give them a sawed-off shotgun to use, and even give them a rack of ribs when their health gets low.

Another feature of the game, is that people can join into your game and help you defeat the zombies.  So if you build a vehicle with a turret for example they can jump in the turret and mow down zombies. I ended up turning this function off, as I wanted my first play-through to be done on my own, without anyone rushing me to go to the next tasks. Weapons are also everywhere, so trying to conserve ammo, and your best weapons is a waste of time because there is plenty to go around. The point of the game is to kill as many zombies as you can. You get rewarded experience (pp), and you can spend points to upgrade your character (health, # of items to carry etc.).

In order to upgrade weapons and vehicles you have to find blueprints that are scattered around the map. They are usually easy to find, as they are located on the maps that you use, and they glow a bright blue.  Weapons can be combined anywhere, while vehicles must be built in a garage. There are also safe zones that need to be cleared out, and these will have change of outfit lockers, and weapons lockers that are stocked with weapons that you have found along the way. So if you found an LMG in the word, LMG machine guns will be available for you to take from the locker. You can usually stock up with a ton of these weapons from the lockers in safe zones.

Another cool feature comes in the form of the Xbox Smart-glass feature. Using and iPad, iPhone, or other Tablet, you can enhance the story of the game. You can receive phone calls from a mysterious survivor who has access to all the cameras around the city. It allows you to also see the map, and find locations of certain weapons. It's a really nice feature, and definitely adds a sense of gameplay.

Another feature is the kinect commands. It allows you point survivors in the direction you want them to go, and even taunt Zombies.  I saw another reviewer that said he ""sneezed"" and the zombies heard him. I have yet to experience this, and the game actually wants you to say ""Hey over here"" to get their attention.

First and foremost, it is important to realize this is not on par with a lot of the recent releases and is likely why is it $10 cheaper. The game mechanics are still somewhat behind the times to include CG animations during cut scenes. That being said, it is still a solid game. This is definitely an acceptable time killer during the summer drought of game releases for the new consoles and a little something different from everything else out there right now.

The single player campaign is reminicent of Sniper Elite V2 (ps3, xbox 360) with a few step ups:

Detection System- This is what really makes it fun. You are able to mask your shots with various environmental assistance (bombs, truck backfires, generators, weather) among snipers nests. If you are detected, you can relocate while the enemy closes in on your last known really creating a fun cat and mouse dynamic similar to the most recent Splinter Cell titles.
""Open"" world- While the worlds are much more open compared to it's predicessor, it still has a few moments of alley-like level design. Regardless, this allows for a much better experience and sniping opportunities.
Empty lung- This may become old over time, but still is sweet and satisfying to this point. The sound of you focusing in, the bullet drop indicator, and then the sweet sound like the crack of a bat on a no doubt home run when you enter bullet time after a kill shot. This feature is what makes the franchise unique.
H2H Combat- FINALLY another option for this game besides a silenced pistol. I appreciate how you cannot take an enemy head on once detected, but can eliminate them if you are quiet and stealthy. This stays true to a stealth experience.
Mechanical destruction- the addition of this adds a new tool to the belt that allows more opporuntites to eliminate enemies.
Tagging system- this allows the player to really plan their attack and determine what methodology to take their shots to produce the best misison results.

A few similar problems:

Sound design- While the sounds themselves are good (guns, ambient bombs, etc.), the sound proximity system is still off. This makes stealth difficult, but not impossible. You have to rely on the mini map rather than sound to determine enemy locations which somewhat takes away from the experience. Guards will sound the same 50 or 5 feet away. I am a bit disappointed rebellion and 505 has yet to figure this out especially for new consoles.
Enemy AI- This is improved, but inconsistent. Enemies often get stuck on terrain, and will return to normal status far too quickly after being alerted. I was expecting a dead body or something of the sort to keep the assault team in alert for the rest of the mission, but alas this is a game not life.
Poor cover system- The ability to go prone is nice, but admittedly I was hoping for a better cover system while crouched.
Terrain catches- I have yet to come across a situation where I had to reset, but it is somewhat of a bummer this is not completely open world. It limits your approach and robs the player of some sweet sniper opportunities. Nonetheless it is open enough to allow diversity and choice for the player which is enough to keep it interesting.

MULTIPLAYER
I hope the lobbies keep a community, as this is where the game is really fun. The campaign is significantly more enjoyable with a buddy. No local multiplayer however, so still very few titles to play with a friend at your place on the market right now.

The competitive modes encourage stealth and distance, which really can become fun and exciting if everyone is playing right.

Overall I would probably wait until the price comes down as this is a solid game, but not quite on par with a lot of the games that have released and especially the ones that are due to release in the next three months. If you are like me and wanted another game besides Titanfall and have already beaten Wolfenstein as great as that was, this is a decent addition to the library.","Not next gen, but good",1404259200,29,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Cards fit on the outfits. Most of the cards are drops from monsters. These cards increase health, add attack or defense value, and so on. There is even a card that increases the time spent in air, useful for those tall pesky giants.

I love everything about the presentation in this game: the characters are adorable, the story is hilarious and absurd, and the cel-shaded approach has never looked finer. The time traveling plot and assortment of anthropomorhpic animals takes me back to the days of shows like ""DuckTales"".

There is, however, a complaint that I have with this game: I wish I had control of Sly Cooper for greater lengths of time (ALL the time would be even better). While Murray and Bentley are cool characters, and they make for an awesome family/team, I found that I began sighing every time one of their segments began loading. When Sly is in control, this platformer can attain a certain level of ""zen"" as you engage in your chains of stealthy feats- leap, perch, climb, balance, strike, repeat (and the controls are identical to the PS2 games, as far as I remember- they've aged wonderfully). However, when the other characters are in control, this becomes something of a clumsy, forced platformer that left me longing for Sly's stealthy, agile ways. That's just my humble opinion- others may enjoy the segments of Sly's friends and the attempts to instill gameplay diversity, but I was always anxious to return to the thieving raccoon. And in the defense of the developer, controlling Sly's friends has always been a part of the experience, even with the original ""Thievius Raccoonus"".

The inclusion of Vita functionality (Cross Buy) with this title makes it pretty enticing for any Sony gamer (especially at $40). I'm a fan of the PS2 Sly Coopers (""Thievius Racoonus"" still being my favorite), and I have not been disappointed with ""Thieves in Time"" (and there are still TONS of collectibles in these worlds calling out to me), so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to those who are in the same boat.

Just recently finished Tomb Raider and in fact played it twice (excellent game), I picked this up today. My expectations were high because IGN gave it a very high review but after playing for a couple of hours I find the graphics subpar and the game dynamics strangely inferior to most 2013 games. Faces in close up view are wonky and when people lie dead on the ground, some of them are curled up with part of the body not touching the ground - I know it's a game but common. Most sequences are repetitive and looks like it was rushed.
The city in the air looks good and the story fair but that's about it. This game reminds me of Wolfenstein, games with below average graphics. As I said, the characters are cartoonish and there's a lot of flaw in conversations.

I had a great time killing and maiming orcs and going after captains and war chiefs. This game would be the result if Batman mates with Assassins Creed. Borrows heavily from both games, or uhhh pays homage to the games, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Even though the combat is awesome, I would give this game 3.5 stars:

1) story is MEHHHHH-tastic. Typical revenge story, but the characters and plot points were very boring. I really didn't care for the story. Just let me pulverize the orcs.

2) Due to the mediocre story, the game quickly devolves into button mashing mayhem, albeit a fun button mashing session, but it does get boring after a while.

3) camera- sometimes the camera gets wonky and it is hard to see what is going on.

4) Unable to change the difficulty of the game. It really is not a challenging game. An experienced gamer can breeze through the game. The Nemesis System is a cool concept, but you don't get killed because the captain or war chief is badass, 9 out of 10 you die because of the horde of orcs. It would have been nice to change the difficulty setting, or ramp up the difficulty based on a player's skill level, or make the war chiefs hard to take down.

They install easily enough, and I think I really like the feel of the gel covering.  Seems to give a lot more traction (for lack of a better word) with my thumbs.

Fired up Destiny and was enjoying myself for about 30 minutes when one on the left thumbstick popped off.  Since this is the movement stick (like ALL FPS games) it's constantly in use.  I finished my round and stuck it back on.  Get back into it... 15 minutes this time and it popped off.

It cannot handle the constant pressure on the edge of the stick, like you would normally apply if you are moving forward constantly.  If you place your thumb directly on the top of the stick, it might stay on, but not the way I (and based on these reviews, many many others) use the left stick.  Only been doing it that way since... what?  Forever?  Since game controllers had 2 sticks and we used them for shooters?

So based on that, and I can't return them since the package has been opened (destroyed), these are worthless on the left stick, which is where I need it the most.

Some of the death animations in this game are just... brutal and incredibly graphic.

Anyway, back on topic: this is an excellent game.  Its a game you hear about where you can play how you want.  Want to be loud and go all out with a bang?  You can do that.  Want to be stealthy and kill all the enemies in the area with not ONE person being able to raise any kind of alarm?  You can do that too.

Things have turned into well.. things quite differently. This Lara is not the Lara I remember of course. The story actually contradicts to what I have learned about Lara and her history (by playing through 5 games of early Tomb raider series including the one with teen Lara).  This game is interesting and it took a lot of elements done right by some other games. I had good time despite a few moments where I find the story a bit underwhelming.  Still there are many things new.  I gave it 4 stars for being entertaining and 1 star off for replacing the Lara that I loved and knew.",It's a great game but there is one problem I have,1391385600,2,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

The 9100 also replaced a Corsair K95 (white LED) mechanical keyboard that I RMA'd and then sold due to a severe defect with the LEDs in that keyboard.

--------------------
DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

The 9100-xB features Cherry MX Blue switches which if you're a novice in the mechanical keyboard world translate into extremely good typing keyboards. MX Blue switches feature a high degree of tactility and each keystroke resonates with a satisfying ""click"". That said if you're new to mechanical keyboards or simply haven't used them in a long while you may want to do some reading up on the differences between each type of switch and find one that's a good fit for your needs.

MX Blue switches happen to pretty loud but as my gaming/productivity PC is located in my basement it's not really an issue. If quietness is a priority then look at some of the quieter varieties available.

Rosewill has done an excellent job designing and building the keyboard; it's not quite up to par with my K95 in terms of construction materials (the K95 featured a stamped anodized aluminum body) but it's still very good. The main body of the keyboard features a heavy duty plastic construction wrapped in a matte-black rubberized plastic coating. The same construction holds true with the wrist rest which is not extremely wide but usable.

Key back-lighting on mechanical keyboards can be tricky as there's an actual mechanical switch in the way but Rosewill has done an excellent job. The only keys that the back-lighting is noticably uneven is along the top-row ""F"" function keys. On these keys the alt-function is located below each ""F"" key and the back-lighting is most noticably uneven. Rosewill elected to keep text on the same row in many other keys for example the 'five' key looks like ""5 %"" on the same row and thus affording even lighting.

The LEDs in the upper-right corner are the standard num-lock; caps-lock; with the addition of a 'G' or gaming key that enables/disables custom macros you can create and assign. The LEDs are definitely eye-catching and sort of resemble digital zeros.

Above the LEDs described above are two (2) USB 2.0 ports; mic and and headphone in. This is a great feature if you use a pair of headphones and don't want to plug directly into your PC or for desktop gadgets. Just be aware that this is a low-voltage device .500mA so that can limit what device you plug in.

--------------------
SOFTWARE:
--------------------

I found Rosewill's software that comes bundled with the Apollo to be actually better than Corsairs macro program and key assigning software. Getting into the specifics of creating and assigning macros is probably more than I should dive into on a review but suffice to say that the software is light-weight, easy to use and Rosewill has included a step-by-step guide. Creating macro's goes way beyond gaming applications too so if you're a developer, author or what have you and you spend a lot of time behind the keyboard definitely investigate this feature.

I will mention that Rosewill's software includes the ability to save 5 distinct profiles and switching between profiles can be done directly from the keyboard without having to open an application.

--------------------
USE:
--------------------

I love typing on this keyboard! If you've been using rubber-dome keyboards then stepping up to a mechanical keyboard is a dramatic improvement! Each keystroke is met with a satisfying ""click-clack"" and key presses are crisp and clean and definitely won't leave you wondering if you've pressed a key or not.

Another thing that I like and what also attracted me to my K95 is that this keyboard doesn't go over the top with the ""boy gamer"" look. It's still a great looking keyboard that separates itself from a run-of-the-mill stock keyboard but without going over the top. I'd have no issues using this keyboard at work in a professional setting or at home using it to play PC games.

The Apollo does come with a key puller that can be used to easily and quickly remove key-caps. Also included are orange 'WASD' and arrow keys if that strikes you. I've kept my keyboard stock but did test pulling several keys and I was surprised at how easy it is to both pull and install the keys.

One issue I do have with this keyboard is that it's missing direct inputs to various adjustments including the LED back-lighting settings, volume, etc. You'll have to using a combination of key shortcuts to make the adjustments; for example 'Fn' and the num-pad '8' key to adjust the LED back-lighting brighter.

--------------------
THE GOOD:
--------------------

(+) Materials. Rosewill has done a nice job selecting quality materials and putting together a keyboard that commands a price tag north of $100. The Apollo feels sturdy and worthy of the asking price.

(+) LEDs. The main reason I decided to scrap my K95 and find a new keyboard. The back-lighting is mostly even and hopefully much longer lasting than on my K95. Also blue LEDs just look amazing!

(+) Style. The Apollo looks different enough from a standard keyboard without going over the top like some ""gaming"" mechanical keyboards. This keyboard would look fine in your office or on your home battlestation.

(+) Tactility. If you've never used a mechanical keyboard or even if you have and haven't tried Cheery Blue MX switches you're in for a treat when you try this keyboard. This is easily my favorite aspect of the Apollo.

--------------------
THE BAD:
--------------------

(-) Multimedia controls. My K95 had a dedicated row of multimedia keys including an analog volume adjuster. With the Apollo you'll have to hold the 'Fn' key and then press another key (several times) to make similar adjustments. The same applies to the LED brightness settings.

(-) Oddities. There are some strange aspects of this keyboard for example the Windows key used in many keyboard shortcuts (e.g. Windows+D minimizes apps and displays the desktop) do not function on this keyboard. Weird.

(-) LED Functions. Occasionally the keyboard doesn't seem to gracefully enter sleep mode whenever I 'sleep' or 'hibernate' my machine. This results in the LEDs on the keyboard staying on. This issue isn't consistent so I'm not sure what's going on.

--------------------
CLOSING:
--------------------

This is my first Rosewill mechanical keyboard and I'm impressed! The Cherry Blue MX switches are superb and feel exactly how a keyboard should.

You have control on how you want to complete your missions. If you want to sneak around and be a sneaky snake you can. If you want to rambo it up and destroy everything you can do that too. It's fun to go back and try things differently. Also when you do things different some scenes play out different too. Also when you get different guns throughout missions they unlock and are place at the start of the levels when you start again. So if you find a sniper rifle, the next time you have it waiting for you at the start of a mission, and then you can start off by shooting out spot lights, or just sniping everyone.
I don't see why people are upset with this game. Sure if you want, you can call it dlc. I myself never get dlc. I always say if the game makers wanted me to play it they would of put it in the game.

I've competed the first 2 cases. Each one took about 2-3 hours to complete not including trying to see all the different possible ends. There are 6 in total so te game should take about 12-18 hours to complete if my maths right.

But the thing that makes this game interesting is that when ever you get enough evidence to accuse someone your welcome to do so, and it's your own wit that or curiosity that keeps you going to see the case to the conclusion.

The good: cases have been interesting and varied. ( the first two cases that is.) the first is a mirder mystery of a man harpooned to a wall. The second is to try and find a missing train.

You can skip any puzzle so if your in it for the story just push that touch pad. If not the puzzles have been interesting and mostly logical which was my biggest issue with te last Sherlock game installment.

Controls have been greatly improved since the last game. You still walk past what you interested in but other then that way better.

Voice acting feels a little less like people reading the text of an adventure game, but there are still moments where people speak just strangly.

There's actually a list of objective during the each case but they are wide enough that you still have to do the investigating to solve the crime while narrow enough to dive you much need direction in knowing which area to go to next.
The blah:

The moral system that is used at the end of the case really doesn't seem to matter much unless you choose the right person. The other people you just get a very slight change to the dialog.

The bad:

Watson remains to be useless. ""What should we do Sherlock?"" Is his usual question asked for advise.

The two chapters I've played both build up to something but then pitter out at the end.

The whatever amount of endings each chapter has comes down to usually just line changes and nothing really interesting to watch. Pretty disappointed in that. Unless it's the actual baddy then the ending video and slight variation.

Load screen, if you are one to hate load screen then be warned. There are tons and you'll need to switch between areas almost constantly it seems. You can do stuff like look at clues when you in a load screen but if your already doing that during you normal game play then it will feel redundant.

I'm also quite enthusiastic about it and love pouring money on better parts and upgrades for my PC (even though most games I run, and prefer, don't require a beefed up rig).

I've been playing MMOs since Ultima Online, back in 1998 (I still have the box with the cloth map and all). I loved it because it included a lot of the things I loved about RPGs from that which, which were an immersive world where you could be anyone you wanted. And you could be whoever you chose: a righteous fighter, an evil, PKing mage, a dishonored thief...

It came with its fare share of problems, but it was the first MMO, and it was great. After many others - Everquest, Anarchy Online etc - came World of Warcraft, and it was another game changer. It provided us with a great, huge and SEAMLESS world to explore. You had to warring factions and, if you were in a PvP realm, the constant, exhilarating threat of being ganked - but also gave you the possibility of ganking others. Also, it had a great lore and worked the kinks on quests, which worked pretty well.

Now, ten years later, countless MMOs and The Elder Scrolls brand name, we have The Elder Scrolls Online. And what have we gotten?

We have this huge but segmented world that never feels it's alive or it's any big. Everywhere you go - travelling to another area, venturing into a cave or simply going to the bank to store a bunch of useless items in one of the worst inventory systems ever (got to hate consolized cr*p) will get you a loading screen. Loading screens everywhere, and even though I got an I7 4770K with a 512GB SSD, the problem is that these loading screens just break immersion and limit what you can do.

The classes are also disappointing, but I gather this might be personal preference. I always like playing the quintessential fighter/warrior or a thief, and none of these are existent here. Having a fighter extrude magical spears from their chest, in a case of shamefully bad animation (a constant throughout the game), does not configure a fighter to me. But, oh well, I swallowed it and kept going).

Ultimately, after paying $80 for the Imperial Edition and $15 monthly (which I won't pay since I'm done wasting my time), I found myself playing alone, doing a bunch of boring and derivative quests. Don't get me wrong: the voice acting is cool and the quests themselves have some story and interaction to them. The problem is that that's all you end up doing: mundane, derivative quests that don't require you to play with others. What's the point of having an MMO if all you do is complete quests, that are being completed by the horde of other players?

Since there's no world PvP and user interaction with the world is minimal, there is almost nothing to do except explore this vast, mostly empty maps fighting some extremely boring NPCs where all you do is watch for very explicit clues as to when to block, bash and attack. If that's all I'm doing, I might as well have a great story and immersion behind it - which this game doesn't have or provide - while not having to pay $15 a month.

My breakdown is:

Pros:
- Good graphics;
- Cool crafting system: I think they nailed this since you can make some actually good gear, and the fact that you can tailor it to be from different types - Norse, Imperial, Breton etc - is great;
- Sound is also good.

Cons:
- Segmented maps: there is no feeling that you're in a a living, exciting world like there was in WoW. Everything is segmented, loading screens abound and it's just a mess and very limiting;
- Boring quests, boring fighting mechanics and skills, boring PvP. Everything is just boring;
- Atrociously bad animation. Even though the graphics are nice, the animation is really bad (just watch your character running and coming to a halt), and you'll realize the initial impression is just a smoke screen: this is a crudely made game with a very bad engine, which caters to the dumbed-down and limiting consoles;
- Bugs.

Yes, there are bugs and exploits, but I'd deal with them or brush them aside if the game itself was interesting. Bugs can be fixed, but the entire game is a joke aimed at consoles - just see the atrocious UI and the inventory screen.

I'm very disappointed with the game but, mostly, with the current state of MMOs. I wouldn't be surprised if this genre ceased to exist in the next 10 years, being replaced by much more immersive, competitive, more balanced and simply more user-friendly games like MOBAs where you actually get to play with other people and get to fight other people instead of the random NPC.","How much is a brand name worth, and how much far have we come with MMOs?",1398384000,12,,

Super Mario, Super Metroid, Zelda, these are the figurative gold mines that Nintendo has, and Kirby lays in the lower part of that list. The lovable pink hero has been prominent, however, with it seeing 23 total games. Triple Deluxe would be exactly what Nintendo needs to push the Kirby franchise to possibly the same ranks as its biggest revenue makers.

First off, it just has great platforming values, mechanics and ideas. The hit detection engine is as accurate as ever, as is the pacing and the way all the new abilities introduced just works seamlessly together to produce a smooth flow from start to final boss. Kirby jumps onto an 'ability bubble' and he gains that particular power, and thus use it to dispatch enemies, maneuver obstacles, to circumvent special locks or doors or in some cases, secret areas to acquire special sunstones and attractive virtual keychains, the game's two collectables. Some bosses require those powers to be approached, and if Kirby sucks them in after they have fallen, or simply sucks in the run-of-the-mill mobs before they have a chance to answer with an attack, he gains the same powers they have. It's all a fun game to be had.

The second thing would be how the gameplay just flows into more gameplay, given that getting all of the sunstones opens up new special areas, that in turn yields more keychains. More of that fun game can be had.

Last of all, the game has as close to a perfect engine as a Nintendo game can have, and the best Kirby graphics yet. If that means perfection for Triple Deluxe it simply is. Triple Deluxe has the most fun gameplay all packed into a game that is flawless, technically and artistically. One could argue that it stands as one of the greatest Nintendo games of the year, and Kirby should be moving up in people's playlists and hearts with ease if the quality keeps coming in.",... impressive first party franchises that spawned some of the best experiences in gaming,1416614400,,,

I just bought myself a Vita Slim on Amazon because of two otome games that are being localized here: Code Realize: Guardian of Rebirth and Amnesia Memories as well as some other games coming out. I realized that a screen protector was essential for the screen. I purchased Hori after reading countless reviews on Amazon and other sites and finally bought one. The application was extremely simple! I did not want to buy screen protectors since usually I have a hard time applying them, but Hori was quick and easy. It gives you all the time you need to align the protector before slowly peeling off each section one at a time so that you don't have any dust particles or bubbles by the time you finish. This will work for your vita slim.

If you are confused: Take out the protector and peel of the tab that says 1. Turn the protector around so that the part you peeled off is facing the screen. This is the part that will stick to the screen. Make sure you have cleaned the screen before you align the protector over your screen. If you don't like the alignment, you can redo this as many times as you need. Once you have it, rub the screen gently so that the sticky part sticks to the screen. Then hold down gently onto the screen protector and peel off number 2. As you do so, make sure to smooth it out as you peel so you get rid of the bubbles. Make sure that you watch out for any dust that might have snuck in so that you can lift the protector and remove it. Continue this for 3. Then, make sure to smooth out any bubbles, check for dust particles etc. before peeling off number 4. You are done!!

If you did get dust under the protector, grab some tape, stick it on the protector and pull. It should come off enough that you can grab it with your fingers to remove the dust.

If you are still unsure, there are youtube videos. Just make sure you specify ""hori screen protectors"" for whatever console it is when looking up videos. My screen looks like there is no protector on it!! It looks great, the touch screen is very responsive and there are no dull colors or warped colors.

It's also really repetitive and they took away mutiplayer which is the most idiotic thing to do. Honestly there's nothing good to say about this game because even if there is customizable options it will take grinding to get.

***I won't reveal anything that has not been revealed in the official trailers***

Roger Ebert wrote in his blog: ""I remain convinced that in principle, video games cannot be art."" Although it would be easy to bash him for his hypocrisy (he defended movies when people said they would never be an art form), the truth is he is old and out of touch with video games. I say unequivocally, that video games have surpassed movies as an art form, and Catherine is just one example why.

OVERVIEW:
First thing to note, this game is ALL about the the storyline and interactions between the 3 main characters. There is a strange love-triangle between Vincent, Katherine, and Catherine. Vincent has been with Katherine for years, and is he happy? Does he want to stay with Katherine forever? A beautiful woman (Catherine) stumbles into his life, and he begins to ponder about his life. Vincent is 32 years old. This should resonate with many people who grew up in the 80s (the original ""Nintendo generation""), since today most will be in their early to mid 30s. He is not married (this also resonates with many people, since today more than ever, people are not getting married until their 30s or later), has a steady girlfriend, has a job, and is actually an intelligent and sensitive guy. When Catherine shows up, he really begins to ponder his relationships and his life.

STORYLINE:
You control Vincent, and the way you interact with people has a definite outcome to the ending of the game. Will you spend your free time at the bar with your friends, or go home early? How will you respond to Katherine's and Catherine's texts? How will you interact with people in general? All your actions mean something (as in real life), and will affect the world around you! This storyline, and you determine how it will end, is told through gorgeous cartoon-like scenes, and everything is fully voiced by professional voice actors who did a fantastic job! The dialogue is mature, well written, funny, and fairly realistic. The problems you (Vincent) and other people face, is (for the most part) very real. Who has reached their 30s and has never had relationship issues? Who does not from time to time ponder how their life is going and would they be more happy if...? However, the game is not just a melodrama. It also beautifully combines horror and humor! The dialogue as I said is very well written and funny. Even during ""frightening"" moments, the dialogue can make you laugh out loud. The dialogue also makes you think, but let's talk about the horror aspect. To discuss this, lets also talk about the meat of the game.

GAMEPLAY:
The core of this game is a platform-puzzle. It takes place during Vincent's nightmares. During these stages you have to reach the top of a structure formed from blocks. First, the game has been criticized for it's difficulty. I played the game on the ""Easy"" setting, and for the most part it is fairly straightforward. You certainly will die (quite often) even on Easy (at least the first time you play the game), however it is not frustrating. In fact, ATLUS USA toned down the difficulty level, so that Easy for North American costumers is substantially easier than the original Japanese release. However, if you are still worried about the difficulty, ATLUS even includes a ""very easy"" option! I have not yet played the game on Normal, but I am certain it will be MUCH more difficult than Easy, and there is in fact a Hard level of difficulty... which will likely be quite the challenge! Anyway, the point is, do not worry too much, since you will certainly be able to get through the game. Now then, about the platforming, as I said, you need to climb. You climb a series of blocks which you can push or pull to open up paths. A simple premise, but there is a lot of skill and variety involved. There are numerous ways to reach the top, and the faster you climb the higher your score (your score has no affect on the storyline and is for bragging purposes only). This game requires thinking! If you enjoy puzzle games, you will likely enjoy this game. When you first play, the controls may seem a bit awkward, for instance, sometimes you'll find you pushed a block when you did not mean to do so, because the controls are so sensitive. It's OK, ATLUS has included an ""undue"" feature! You can undue your moves quickly, and try again, with no penalty! This ""undue"" feature is available for the Easy and Normal modes. Now then, is the puzzle-part of the game actually fun? Yes, very fun. However, if you do not enjoy puzzle games, then you should skip this game. For everyone else, welcome!

MUSIC:
I LOVE the music in this game! It's a combination of soothing jazz, with arrangements of classic music. The music really hits the spot, and in my opinion is perfect. If you enjoy ""fantasy"" music (either in games or movies), then I think you will very much enjoy the music here. When the action gets fierce (and it does), the classical music also gets fierce (yes, you'll be surprised, classical music can be fierce)! When you reach the top, and have survived the nightmare, you will be rewarded with Handel's Messiah (and it sounds great)! All the classical music is arranged, which means that this is NOT the ""normal"" arrangements that you can purchase online or listen to at a performance. The arrangements were specifically made for this game, and not only are they lovely and catchy, but you get a FREE CD SOUNDTRACK of these arrangements if you pre-ordered the game (I believe every first print of the game comes with an artbook and soundtrack)!

MATURE CONTENT:
You probably noticed that I did not talk much about graphics. The reason being that you have likely already seen the trailers and know what the graphics are like. They are beautiful. However, you should NOT purchase this game for the graphics. You SHOULD purchase this game if you want a game with a deep, original, and fascinating storyline. The game does not hold back on the mature content. However, keep in mind that mature content does NOT mean pornographic material! I will say this once: other than a bit of cleavage and maybe a buttocks, THERE IS NO NUDITY HERE! This game is NOT ""Leisure Suit Larry"", your goal is NOT to score! If you're a teenage boy (either physically or mentally) and you just want to play this game because 'Catherine is hot... oh yeah... hot' then you are going to be very disappointed. Vincent is a mature man, and the game ultimately asks just one question: What is love? There is nothing more mature in art and literature, then the question of love.

PROS:
+++Original and thought-provoking storyline that is superbly presented! THIS IS INTERACTIVE ART!
+++Beautiful graphics, and fantastic music!
+++Top notch voice acting!
+++Various difficulty levels so everyone can finish the game!
+++Different endings depending on YOUR choices!
+++Humor and horror combined in a wonderful way that few games can match!
+++If you get a first print of the game, you get a free artbook and SOUNDTRACK!

CONS:
-Well, the game is relatively short (first time through will be 10-20 hours). However, with different endings and difficulty levels (as well as multiplayer) you can come back for more!
-MSRP is $60. That's quite a bit. The price will definitely go down. However, you might not get the soundtrack (which would be a shame). Honestly, this is $60 very well spent, and if you get it for less, even better (but trust me, you want this soundtrack :)

BOTTOM LINES:
Are you looking for something original, fresh, with a storyline and characters that most men AND women in their 30s can really relate to? Something with beautiful animated cut-scenes, fantastic music, and a mature storyline that is NOT about saving the world? In that case, welcome to Catherine! Catherine is the latest example of how video games can make us think, laugh, and even get teary-eyed.

Works amazing for CS:GO, I can't tell you how many times I heard a single tiny footstep in the distance and was accused of wallhacks. I haven't had these for a super long time yet, but the build quality seems pretty damn sturdy. Mic clarity is very good. Sound quality is borderline equal with my ATH-M50x headphones that broke, and that's really impressive for a headset that's half the price and designed for gaming, not music. Of course it's not as good for music as the m50s, but still I was extremely impressed by the sound quality on these.

My only complaint is that while the mic is detachable, the cable is not (added with the Cloud II I believe).
The Cloud is....like a cloud when you are wearing it.

I liked that the characters had to loot places to make their weapons and health kits for survival. It gets a little difficult when you cant always find the items you need but that helps make the game exciting. It also forces you to think of other ways to beat the current mission.

  -extracted in brig is locked out, so you can't kick out lower rank.  after a while, lower rank soldier released into you org, mess up you staff management.  it wast of time

Bioware developers always do a great job of making things accessible and logical during gameplay.

3,False,"02 14, 2015",A2QZL3PARF6TRW,B00JUFT1F6,Booya!  Werewolves!,"A fairly good game I guess, but one that dropped the ball on quite a few things.

Bad stuff:

Removing the companion specific skill trees and friend/rival system were both huge mistakes.  All of the companions in this game are solid in form, that is personality, look, banter etc, but in function the 3 warriors, 3 mages and 3 rogues are only differentiated by the locked in specialization tree, which means which ever companion that shares your class and has the locked in specialization you happen to pick is basically just a worse version of your character.  Before specializations it's really bad.  Sera and Varric for example are basically the exact same character except Varric can only use Bianca for a bow.  Now you COULD make them both dagger rogues, but that would be against what  the game tells you about them.
It seemed lazy and like such a missed opportunity here as most of the companion seemed like they SHOULD have unique skills.  Blackwall for example, being a grey warden should have some extra prowess in killing darkspawn should he not?  Nope.
As a result I ended up just using Sera, Solas, and Casandra for basically the whole game.  I would occasionally swap out Cassandra for Blackwall or Solas for Viv, just for banter, and because I felt bad never taking them along, but usually just stuck with the main 3.  I only used Cole once, but he was the companion in the unfortunate position I mentioned above of being my class/specialization, and thus being fairly pointless, which is too bad as he is one of the most unique characters in the game, fiction wise.  In DA2 I felt I had good reason to switch around characters as they all felt unique in play.
I know you can just do different builds of the common trees for each character, but... in practice no one felt unique in play.
And not knowing where you stand with any of your party members was really missed, as was getting to see a tangible result of them not liking what you do in both their interaction as well as their abilities.  You really felt like you impacted them as individuals.

Crafting was overwrought and convoluted.  You could have gotten a very similar if not identical effect with less pointless steps.  The hilts and grips and arms and legs.  Did not add to my enjoyment of the game.

Crafted items trumped unique loot items at very least half of the time.  That is being VERY generous.  Its probably close to 80%.  I sold nearly all the purple items I found, even the ones with quests based around them because I could craft better.

Item's in general were lackluster.  The only stat that was really apparent was damage/armor.  Fights were usually too fast and frantic for see the effect of a 5% stagger chance or what have you.

Search button was probably the worst design mistake.  Not only is it stupid that you have to constantly be spamming the command, but on the PS4 the button is the hardest one to press on the controller.  I get thumb cramps.  I get that that's a port issue, not a game issue, but still, it IS an issue.
Also the lack of differentiation of things that come up in the search.  An elfroot and a treasure chest and ladder are the same little yellow dot and same bing noise. I often did not care about picking up rocks and flowers, but I had to hunt them down anyway cause I didn't know what they were.

Rock collecting and flower picking.  FAR too much of this.  Far too much.  A system like DA2 or like lumber stands and quarries, where you find a ""source"" and thus have access to that source via minions would have been much preferred.  You could even leave in the ""rare"" materials with that kind of a set up if you wanted to be sure there was something fun to hunt for and get excited about finding.  Dragon bits and all that.

Jumping is underdeveloped.  Too often I was sure I could scale a cliff face or vault a rock or brick and found I either could not, or it would take ages to find that sweet spot that let me proceed.  I often felt like the map design was rubbing my noes in it with these teasing areas, and having to walk around.

Jumping and interaction command both using x.  Allllll the time jumping instead of picking up loot/opening chests or vice versa.

Mounts seemed like a tack on, hardly ever used them.  Can't use search, and the aren't all that fast.

Quests are too uninvolved, and frequently too uninspired.  Way too much standard mmo style fetch, find, kill.  Very few large dungeons, or long branching quests (non main quest).  Maybe one ""big"" place per area, and the big places were really only like 2 floors.

Like DA2 it was too directionless.  80% ""emprie building"" side quest stuff, 20% meat.  It felt very much like an MMO at times.  Not a fan.  Letting players choose what to do next is fine, but make the story progress.  This game wants to be Skyrim and just fails to have that same grand feel.  The bad part is the DA:O was not like Skyrim, and it was amazing fun.  They need to get back to those roots.

Good stuff:

Graphics are generally very nice.  Locations are well made on the whole.  It was fun to run around the lovely vistas.

Big bosses were fun.

Lots of stuff to do.  Plenty of quests, and areas to explore, tons of easter egg hunts, plenty of replay value from a playstyle and character building point of view if the quibbles you have with the game are not too daunting.  Easily hundreds of hours worth.  Good value.

Combat is pretty fun.  Unless you are a dual rogue... which my first character was, which was kinda of sucky.  Pick a different character and it's much more fun, IMO.

Lots to read.  Lots and lots.  Much of it directly relevant to what you are doing.  Every Bandit and Red Templar is sitting in camp writing up a journal.  :P  If you don't like to read this could be a minus.

I know the cons seems to greatly outweigh the pros, but it's not all that dire.  The game is mostly composed of ""decent"" rather than ""good"" or ""bad"", so it's mostly a decent game.
While I gave this game a lower rating than I gave DA2, I think it's at least as good a game, and probably a better game in many regards.  The reason I feel the 3 stars (I would say 3.5) is warranted is because they didn't learn enough from the the missteps they made in 2.  In fact they seemed to double down and go even further away from DA:O which was the definitive DA experience one that should be built ON, not built OVER.  They are replacing depth with gloss, and the experience, while perfectly FUN is not especially GOOD.  That's my thoughts on it anyway.

If you are new to the franchise I could see 4 stars being a reasonable rating.","Fun, but fairly shallow.",1423872000,4,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5,True,"12 6, 2014",A2VCC9UVM30151,B00JUI8HJ4,B Martin,"Any one who is giving this 1 and 2 star reviews is just batty. This is easily one of the best games out there at the moment. Yes, there are few issues for the PC which curbed my initial excitement upon first playing. I was really disappointed at not being able to just right click to move, as that's been a series staple since the beginning. Removing it serves no real benefit from the 25 hours I've been playing. I get how they sort of made two ""modes"" to the game and combat, the tactical view and a sort of action / hybrid where you directly control a character.

I actually like this way of combat but the tactical view needs some work on the pc. For one, it zooms in too close when switching to it, making it useless inside. You actually have a better view of your people and the battlefield in the normal view.  The path finding for melee characters when using the tactical view needs work. They constantly shuffle and rework themselves trying to get in the position where you sent them, losing valuable combat time and taking needless damage. For ranged characters it works fine but controlling my melee main character in tactical view was almost useless. Some tweaks to that will actually make it useful.

Secondly, you can't queue up commands. Which is kinda baffling. At least let us go two deep so I can move a character someplace then queue up an attack or spell for them to do once they get there. After you send them someplace, like sending a mage out of the fight zone, they always never stay there and end up needlessly putting themselves next to bad guys taking area of effect damage. (I found out you can press shift and click for them to move and hold a position). It's a little frustrating. Addressing some of these issues, at least with the camera being goofy in tactical view would solve a lot of the ""PC USER RAGE"" that you see in the reviews.

Also the PC interface is needlessly cluttered. Quest stuff is huge and takes up a good portion of the right side of the screen. The map has no drawing on it so it's just a clear background that doesn't show landmarks or the lay of the land, only enemies and your quest marker, making it not as effective as it could be. Especially since it too takes up a big fat space on your screen.

Also, at the beginning I had some crash to desktop and one super scary bug during rift fights that cause my entire computer to wonk out to a black screen with the only recourse to hard reboot. I had just gotten a new video card and was worried I had got a bad one. So I spent a few hours trouble shooting my card, testing components to  make sure I didn't have a faulty card. That was hours wasted. I know the 970s just came out and so did the game but come on.

With all that being said I still enjoy the game. The graphics are awesome and everything looks gorgeous if you have the power to run it. The game runs good for me on high settings. Combat is fun once you get used to it and I actually enjoy it more than Origins and 2 because it combines the best of both worlds. The action combat and tactical management could be better meshed, but I think that can be addressed with some tweaks.

The story so far isn't earth shattering, it's still fun and enjoyable to follow. I've read a few of the later books and it's nice to see some subtle ties to them. Though I felt like the whole ""You're the world's savior"" was a little rushed. You're practically the world's savior within the span of hours, with leaders and rulers deferring to you as their commander too easily. Cassandra goes from thinking you're a criminal to making you head of the inquisition within an hour or so of the game. It just felt a little unbelievable.

After that the story gets going and has been pretty fun. Sadly, I haven't been impressed with BioWare character design since Origins. Half the cast of DA:I seem meant for a lesser game, nothing really inspiring about them. Though I felt they were much better than 2. Solas seemed a throwaway character for me but ends up being my main guy. Though it seems like they've made half the characters bisexual just to push the envelope. Dorian is a flamboyant openly gay mage and so are half the female characters. The Iron Bull looks like he's wearing drag make up and Sera is just plain ugly. I not trying to sound like  a hater but for me it was a little off putting. It's not that bad though, Dorian is cool and Sera is one of my favorite characters, her personality is funny and cool. I just hope it fits in with the story.

So if you're a fan of the first two should you buy this? If you generally liked 2 then yes, you'll love this one. I enjoyed both Origins and 2 for different reasons and beat both of them. I enjoy this one on it's own merits and felt like BioWare did a fantastic job with the game. There are so many things to do and see, sort of like Skyrim but with a better story and better cinematics for your character. Skyrim I always felt was too boring in some aspects, though I loved it I never felt truly invested in my character, I was just a faceless and emotionless pair of hands. Here you really feel invested in who you create and how you shape the world, and to me that is awesome.

So if you loved Origins but hated 2, and not much of a fan anymore then the answer is maybe. Watch some videos and read some reviews but they've made the game more ""action oriented"" and less Baldurs Gate / Origins tactical. I loved the hybrid approach but you may not.

Overall this is a phenomenal game, don't listen to 1 star reviews as that is just asinine. There are many things to love here but a few things need help.

When I saw the trailer for AW and saw that they added a bunch of futuristic boost packs and weapons I was even more certain I wouldn't like this game. After a few minutes of playing the game I was hooked! This game is so much better than Ghosts. The graphics are amazing. Day zero edition gives you a code for 2 exclusive weapons.

Campaign Mode:
Most people buy CoD for multiplayer but I also like to go through campaign mode. Campaign mode looks to be the best one yet. I have not finished the campaign yet but after several levels in, I am very impressed. For starters the graphics are the best I've seen on any PS4 game. Not only is Kevin Spacey a voice actor but the character looks just like him. Gameplay is fast paced and takes you through fun situations like fighting on a highway (reminds me of the scene in the movie Matrix Reloaded).

Survival Mode (co-op):
As far as I can tell there are no zombies in this game, but survival mode is a similar mode. You have to survive wave after wave of enemies while upgrading your weapons between rounds. CoD Ghosts' Extinction mode had only 1 map and you start with only a pistol. In CoD AW survival mode you start with an assault rifle so you aren't stuck using a crappy gun every time you start over. Also there are several maps to choose from (and more get unlocked as you play). You choose 1 of 3 classes when you begin (light, heavy, and specialist). Light starts with an assault rifle, Heavy starts with a lazer gun than has unlimited ammo, and specialist is sniper or shotgun. Scorestreak perks are available in survival mode as well. The waves go up to level 25 before you ""flip the map"" and start over again from level 1 but with harder enemies. After you flip the map the levels keep track of how many times by adding a number after the level # (i.e. wave ""26"" is wave 1-2, wave 27 is 2-2, wave ""50"" is 25-2, wave ""51"" is 1-3, etc). A few of the rounds give you an objective (recover intel, defend a certain area,etc) If you fail the objective more enemies arrive and enemy gun turrets are placed around the map, so don't fail! If you remember the Juggernaughts from the MW series campaign Ops mode, there is a similar heavily armored enemy in this mode called the Goliath. The catch is you can be the Goliath!!! The Goliath is a scorestreak that drops an armor suit, you step into it and have more health and unlimited ammo for the gun.

Multiplayer:
Multiplayer is similar to the MW series and has all the game modes from deathmatch to CTF. The exo boost jumps allow players to jump alot higher so that adds another element to the gameplay. Alot of player seem to want to stay on the high ground and jump on top of rooftops. As you progress and level up you unlock weapons and gear. But sometimes the gear ""expires"" and you lose it. For instance I earned a new helmet from a supply drop, nothing functional it just looked cool, it expired after a day and I lost it. Your character is alot more customizable in this game. You can even customize the scorestreaks to make them more powerful (and cost more to obtain).

The futuristic stuff:
So I like I said earlier I was on the fence about this game deviating from the realistic to the futuristic. So here are some of the expanation of the futuristic stuff. You wear an exo suit that allows you to boost jump (not fly). It can also give you the ability to cloak or use a shield for a limited amount of time. Your tactical grenades now include a ""threat detection"" grenade that scans nearby enemies and makes them glow red on your HUD (even through walls) for a few seconds. There is now a ""smart grenade"" that seeks out nearby enemies when you throw it in their direction. In single player campaign there are swarms of drones (reminds me of movie Enders Game or Matrix Revolutions) that you basically need an EMP to kill. One of the gun sights has built in threat detection (can also detect cloaked enemies).

So if your turned off on the whole shift more towards Halo/Destiny and away from the WW2/realistic style don't be. Give this game a shot you won't regret it. 4.5 stars","Wasn't sure about the futuristic stuff at first, and NO ZOMBIES!",1416355200,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

5,True,"07 25, 2015",A2R0S6B2ZOBSQX,B00K848IH0,Crazycucumbers,"This is a pretty long review. I summed up the entire thing in the very final, short paragraph. If you want to get specific then read the whole thing. Otherwise, just go straight to the bottom, and read the last paragraph.

Before I get started, I should say that this is my first Pokemon game. Ever. Everybody always told me that Pokemon is amazing and all that but I never really believed them. I heard it so much that I decided to buckle down and try it.
 This game is pretty awesome. There is a lot to cover, so I'll try to make it brief. It starts off with you moving to another town, from who-knows-where. If it was mentioned, I forgot. You are next door neighbors to the Pokemon Professor dude, and he's pretty cool. So basically, you go to meet him and he's gone. Asking around a bit, he was on some route studying Pokemon. When you find him he is being chased by a Pokemon, so you choose your starter and fend the aggressive Pokemon off.

From there, what you do is simple: you travel around the region, collecting more Pokemon, strengthening them, while collecting enough gym badges to enter the Pokemon league. Those are the absolute basics, there is a LOT more plot and all, but I don't want to ruin it for anybody. If you don't know what a gym badge is, I'll tell ya: there are gyms with strong Pokemon trainers as the leader. 8 to be exact. You go to the gym, challenge the trainer, and if you win you get a specific badge. You can only get one once. Each of the badges has some special abilities that you can use once you get them.

 There is a tad more to it than that, but you'll figure it out once you get playing. It isn't hard.  There are different approaches to playing this game. Some people want to try and collect any and every Pokemon they ever come across. Even if they already have one of that kind. Some people want to get one of each. Some people want to get what ones they need and just ditch the rest. However you play is up to you. I personally don't ditch any, but I don't go for every single one either. If i don't have it, and I kinda want it, I'll try to get it.

I have heard that in Pokemon X/Y, you customize your trainer. I haven't played either, although I plan to. Point is that there is no character customization to be had here.

There are more things to do with your Pokemon than catch them and force them to fight, like this is some sort of animal fighting ring. There is a place in the menus called "" Pokemon Amie"". I have no clue what Amie means, but basically this is the place where you play with your Pokemon. You can pet them, certain areas of them make them angry. You can feed them, luckily you can't overfeed them. You can play mini games with them, like puzzle tiles for example. The more you do these things with them, the more affection they will have for you. Eventually, if they have enough affection, it can have some SERIOUS bonuses in battle. They can shake off negative status effects because they want to impress you or whatever. They can survive a hit that would normally would have made them faint, forcing you to throw out another Pokemon. Small things like that are more helpful than you would think.

There is a super training place for your Pokemon next to the Pokemon Amie. I can't tell you much about it because I never use it.

Then, there is online play. Online play allows you to do many things. You can battle people on your friends list. You can battle random people who are in the same area as you in the game (you don't see them). You can trade. The battle and trade things are pretty self explanatory, so I won't bother going into those, but there is one thing you should be aware of, which is Wonder Trade.

Wonder Trade allows you to put up a Pokemon of your choosing. If you decide to trade it, THERE IS NO GOING BACK AT ALL FAIR WARNING. Once you choose the Pokemon you are going to trade, you are paired with another random person who is using Wonder Trade as well, and you trade Pokemon. You have no idea what it is going to be until you receive it. They keep whatever nickname the Original Trainer gave them, and there is no way to change them. Some of the names are obscene. I won't even name one because they get so bad, but honestly it is pretty rare that you get an obscene name. I've only ever come across it twice.

There are some problems with Wonder Trade though. It is 100% random. There isn't anything like ""Only Pokemon above lvl 50 will be counted"" nothing like that. As a result, out of every 10 Wonder Trades you do, 9 will be a level 1 Pokemon that usually sucks. I didn't even know it was possible to get these Pokemon at level one. I think there might be a way to breed Pokemon but I have no clue. That's the only explanation I can come up with other than hacks. Consider yourself warned: Wonder Trade is not, in any way, wonderful.

There is only really one other thing that I should mention before I end this review: trainers. They are everywhere. I mean everywhere. It's unbelievably annoying. Trainers are NPC characters that battle you. If you walk in front of them, or basically anywhere near them, a battle begins. It isn't like ""would you like to battle? Yes/No"" You walk in front of them and the battle begins. No joke. There is no way to tell if somebody is a trainer or not. Just assume that everybody is, because probably 90% of all other characters in the game are trainers you must battle. There is no way to escape the battle besides quitting the game. They like to stand next to doorways that you are required to get through to continue the game. There are very few that are avoidable. It gives you a lot of experience points, and aside from selling stuff it is the only way you can get money that I am aware of. But there are just SO MANY. You walk not even 10 steps, then BAM a trainer goes ""nice weather for a picnic, huh?"" and then a battle begins. They say the most random things for the start of a battle...

To sum up, a nice game. Fun, lots of different styles of playing for different gamers. The only real downs to this game I can come up with are Wonder Trade and Trainer Battles. Wonder Trade is something that one can just ignore. The trainers are an annoyance, but the rest of the game is good enough that you are fine with having to battle them as long as you get to continue. They don't ruin the game, they just make it tedious.

I would say 5 stars. It has it's negatives, like every game ever, but is has enough goods to outweigh the negatives.

Update: A few days after completing the game. I have a few things to add. There is only one save file in this game. You can't have multiple, you can only have one. I found out about this thing called the Nuzlocke challenge and I really want to do it, but that would mean deleting my current save. Not only is it my first Pokemon game save ever, it also has a couple Pokemon in it that you can only possibly ever get once. Other than trading, there isn't any way to get a Diance after the event ended...that I know of. What's important is that if I deleted my save file, it would all be gone forever. The game saves onto the cartridge, not the SD card, so I couldn't copy the save to my computer. If there were two save files then that would be great. It would also allow you to try different methods of raising your Pokemon. There are many different ways to complete your goals in this game, but I can't try them without deleting precious mementos of extreme rarity. And one more thing: the rival of this game is the most annoying character ever. A lot of people love him, but I personally cannot stand him. My main problem is that he gets too sentimental whenever something happens. For instance, every time you battle him and win, this really dramatic music begins to play and he goes on a speech about how much you've helped him grow not only as a trainer, but as a person blablahblah it's annoying. And it only gets worse and lasts longer as you get further into the game. And he always wears pajamas. I personally would like a rival who gave me a reason to want to beat them. A good reason. Doing something that got in the way of completing something important, like taking the starter that you had already chosen and forcing you to pick another. Stealing a key item or whatever while you were busy. I don't know, something! All I think when I run into this guy is ""Man, I just want to absolutely obliterate his Pokemon so he won't bother me anymore"" I know he'll keep coming, but he's an annoyance. I want one that makes me think ""ugh!  I need to show this guy who's boss! I hope he battles me!"" You know. And it wouldn't hurt to make the rival related to the story.

Update: So it has been a while after I beat the Pokemon League for the first time. Decided I should add more things. I have owned this game for close to a month now, and I still haven't gotten even close to 100% completion. I recently have started going around visiting secret bases of fellow players, and it is pretty fun. You can add the owner of the secret base to your own if you want to, and they are available for battle once a day. They only use 3 pokemon, but they can be pretty difficult. It's good experience points and money if you want to train some of your Pokemon. There's those contest things, but I have no interest in them. Online battles are available, but I have heard about bad things happening to players who participate recently. I have been told that some people hack their cartridges or something, and make it so that if you online battle them, your save file is deleted. So, I am avoiding it like the plague. Then there is catching more Pokemon. The thing about the Pokemon catching part is that you really have to be into the ""catch em' all!"" slogan. To me, catching them all seems like too much of a chore, especially since there isn't even enough room on the game cart to hold all pokemon available in the game. Besides the fact that I don't think you get any items for getting them all. Not enough incentive for me. However, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't do it. For all I know, there may be some special item at the end of the long road. Or maybe you just enjoy catching as much stuff as possible. The fun factor of the post-game content really depends on what kind of player you are. I am the kind that won't do a tedious and painstaking task if it doesn't have some sort of reward at the end of it. Some players really just like to entirely do every single thing in the game just because they can, or for bragging rights. Whatever it is, you can still enjoy yourself once the main and secondary story end, because there is still lots to do.","Has negatives, but the good stuff is REALLY good!",1437782400,5,"{'Edition:': ' Alpha Sapphire', 'Platform:': ' Nintendo 3DS'}",

It's a good FPS with a great open world, pretty nice graphics, and even if the story is ultimately forgettable, the characters still stick to mind. Special mention for the ecosystem which will never cease to amaze me, with animals hunting each other and just living their lives as you pass by.

All in all a good game that still falls into the same problems as the Assassin's Creed series: with such a big open world, there is way too much to do, and you easily get lost amongst the hundreds of repetitive sidequests, towers to unlock and other allies to help, and then stop following the main story, and in a way stop progressing in the game, until you just get bored of it and abandon it.

Basically showing the summary in video highlights of how they game went for both teams. Graphics are amazing to watch and play!!!! There will be WTF moments but I say, you won't see as much unlike FIFA 14 had so many mistakes that I had experienced. Enjoy this game, and I recommend everybody who loves the game of soccer to get this game and play online or with family/friends. :D :D Super glad to review this and record my gamplay and uploaded on Youtube :D

EDIT: The game is great but after awhile, you will most mistakes from the AI teammates so I give it a 4 star, because there make a big impact of losing the game or getting scored on.

Forza Horizon 2 makes it a point to avoid the worst habits of other racing game developers like a plague, and the end result is spectacular.

Let me first get the ""bad"" stuff out of the way.

1.  You can only adjust the volume for SFX and the Radio.  There is no way to make people's voices louder without making the sound effects louder or vice versa.
2. While you can change what icons appear on your map, it doesn't save your changes from one play session to the next, meaning you have to change them every time you load the game or new events are added to the map.
3. You can't change the controls.  Really, I think pretty much every new game oughta let you do this by now.

But the real ""flaw"" of interest is that there were several things in the Xbox One version that are not in this one.  Most notable are the following:

1. DLCs.  Forza decided to shower the X1 version with DLCs while officially stating the 360 version will never get any.
2. ""Forza rewards"", which sometimes result in you getting cars that are not available in the 360 version.  This is an interesting one to include though, because there are also cars in the 360 that you can't get in the X1, so go figure.
3. A feature called ""wheelspins"" where you can get more money after every level you gain and at times even a free car.  I've actually come to appreciate that the 360 version DOESN'T have this, though, because I think the rate at which you can get money for buying/upgrading vehicles in the 360 is perfect as it is.  Any easier would be TOO easy.
4. As can be expected, the graphics aren't as detailed as in the X1 version.  But like #3, this is sometimes a good thing.  Like, if you're in cockpit view and going through a field in the X1 version, sometimes the grass is too thick to see through and too high to see over!
5. No rain!  But yet again, I kind of like it that way.  Sure, the rain LOOKS nice, but it's also a pain to drive in (naturally). And apparently, it rains like every single day in the X1 version and you can't ever turn it off.  I get all the handling challenges I need from the different sorts of terrain already available in the 360 version, thank you.
Finally, 6.  Some of the areas that are open in the X1 version are closed off to you in the 360.  It's still a huge map to cruise around in, though.

Okay, now it is time to talk about all the things that still make this game very worthy of a five-star rating!

For starters, rather than dragging us through another Fast and the Furious-like machismo contest (NFS, anyone?), Forza Horizon 2 opted to make this race game... about racing!  So you won't find any cutscenes in which some bozo gives your character the ol' ""You're new in town.  You gotta prove yourself to me!"" attitude.  You're there for a racing event known as the Horizon Festival.  Simple, and sweet!  It's a colorful playground even at night, what with fireworks going off in the sky for you to admire and good music on the radio. A real nice vibe.

Neither graphics nor a sizable open world can make a game great on their own.  Fortunately, FH2 gives us both of these things and in good quality.  I really expected to at least see a fair amount of pop-ins, or for the screen to tear or even freeze at the speeds I was flying down the highways at, but nope!  There were, like, 2 or 3 instances of the game glitching and me falling through the ground in the literally hundreds of events I won (not to mention all the hours I spent in this game just cruising around) and that's not bad considering all this is happening on the 360 and not the newer Xbox One.

While there isn't a huge variety of things to do when compared to GTA games or even NFS-like titles, I was very surprised to see that the fair amount of activities available kept my interest for so long!  In addition to dozens and dozens of races (which include both circuit racing and ""sprints""), there are events called ""Bucket List"" events, and these require you to either fly through a speed trap at a given speed, perform various stunts (drifting, jumping, traveling at high speeds, etc.) to reach a certain number of skill points, or just make it to a given destination before a time limit runs out.  There are also tons of collectible ""reward boards"" hidden all over the map which you can smash into to get cash or discount rewards.  And then there are ten free vehicles you can find in barns abandoned just waiting to be found and spruced up.

I also liked how you can go right up behind any race car on the highway and challenge them to a race, the destination of which is randomly chosen by the game so it always feels new.  And there are four special events called Sponsorship Events in which you're not even racing against another car!  For example, the first event has you racing a crop duster - I'm not even kidding.

Now let's talk about the vehicles.  There are over 200 cars to choose from.  You can also get a truck, a jeep, a van, an SUV, or a hummer.  They each fall into one of several ""division"" classes, in which you'll be challenged to finish every race before you've truly mastered that event.  This makes for a ton of replay value, along with the challenge of beating other people's best times.  Customization is superb.  An insane number of color options and decals/vinyls, and the game allows you to save color schemes for use on other vehicles if you wish.  Not to mention you can use the decals in the game to create your own unique decal, save it, and throw it anywhere on the rest of your vehicles (i.e., you can have your very own logo).  Upgrading performance related parts is a blast too.  It's remarkable how many options you get.  And every little thing you change will affect your car's handling, speed, acceleration, launch, braking, horsepower, torque, or weight (which affects how your car accelerates, handles, and brakes as well).  Like with the decals/vinyls, you can save your unique preferred setup and apply it to the next vehicle you buy for that division, if you so choose.

Finally, I have to comment on certain things I personally appreciated here.  For starters, the GPS places a ""driving line"" (which is better than floating arrows, IMO) right on the road for you so you minimize how often you're looking at the mini-map in the corner of your screen.  When you reach a section of the line that is red, stop or slow down; when it's green, you can floor it.  If you're on your way to one event but decide on the spur of the moment to race someone on the highway, the line's replaced automatically by one leading to the end of that race, and then afterwards automatically reverts back to leading to your original destination.

And of course all of this can be turned off if you prefer a more challenging, realistic experience.  That goes for several assists and other parts of the HUD (e.g., speedometer, skills point updates, etc.) Event indicators can't be turned off but that's a minor issue. Basically, if you crave an enormous challenge, you can get it here; if you want things to be pretty easy, you can make it that way too.  This means yes, they do have the rewind feature - where if you make a mistake and slam into a wall, you can choose to rewind back several seconds and try the turn again (unlimited rewinds).

There are no cops to hassle you in this game.  Me personally, I always hated being pestered by them while trying to race or just speed along.  Yes, it's more realistic but that doesn't automatically make it more fun.  If I don't have an uzi like in GTA, I don't want cops after me, period :P

Each sport has online play and training modes.

Tennis- My favorite, there is no feeling like playing another player from somewhere around the world in an intense match of tennis. First one of the players serves the ball ( Sometimes with a fast fiery hit ) then the game goes on with the responsive Wii Remote Plus, but the number one issue is having to recalibrate the remote every second by pressing the down button. Before I knew how to recalibrate the remote I did horrible because the remote always lost it's place. Other than that, overall fun and tough game!

Bowling- Bought this with tennis on the early days of Wii Sports Club, and there is no game out there that can offer a more realistic bowling feel. Each player gets a turn, I sit down between turns because that game wears you down :D And the actual bowling part feels so realistic. Hold down B, swing back the remote, let go of B, and off goes the ball with precise measurements thanks to the Wii Remote Plus. Fun game, very realistic but as energetic as tennis.

Golf- I have to admit the whole laying down the gamepad for precise hits is such a clever idea, and it does work! Yet calibration also ruins some of the fun in this game. Overall i'm not a golf person so I have to admit, I didn't find this one to fun, or even get it :/

Baseball- One of the more recent games released for download on the eShop, also delivers an energetic punch. One player pitches with the gamepad, the other swings with the Wii Remote Plus. Although it's somewhat of a hassle to swith in between the two, it still offers an awsome experience, also if you just plan on getting baseball from the eShop you will also get boxing with it :) I really had a lot of trouble batting but still great game, but very simple.

Boxing- Last but certainly not least is boxing, I cant decide if I love it more than tennis! Now first thing is first NUNCHUKS ARE NOT USABLE IN BOXING! If you only have one remote than you can only use one remote which truly sucks :( but if you have two Wii Remote Plus then the fun begins (I wouldn't recommend this game to somebody with only one Wii Remote Plus, trust me it sucks) With two remotes you can throw some accurate punches, with powerful shots >:] tilt both remotes andyou Mii character leans, face the remotes buttons towards you and you character is in standing position. Calibration also plays a major role in this too :/ if you swing to hard or much you lose calibration and have to go back to a nuetral position by pressing both B buttons on the Wii Remote Plus. There is no better and more intense experience as the boxing in this game :)

Overall, great game but calibration kinda ruins a major part of it thats why i believe it is only 4 stars, butif you are in search of a one of a kind experience then look no further than for Wii Sports Club :)",No nunchuk in boxing but it doesn't really matter all the other sports are so fun!!!,1406246400,11,,

After ignoring my 360 and just focusing on the XBOX One, I will admit I was wrong. The game on XB1 is far better, in many, many ways. Graphics are definitely superior but not up to par to some other XB1 games. The game play is more fluid due to the better engine. As a huge fan of Madden and the NFL, I still am sourly disapointed in the Madden series but Madden 15 is definitely the best Madden to date if its played on the PS4 or XB1.

I actually think it graphically looks worse than Madden 25 on the 360, which is odd. I just spent $60 on a roster update and what appears to me, worse graphics than the previous Madden 25 on the 360 lol. All the new marketed features, such as ""A New Point of View"" are ONLY on the One or PS4, not PS3 or the 360 lol. Talk about a sham and rip-off.

It's OK at best on the 360. I'm more upset it looks (to me) worse than the previous Madden (Madden 25). Seems odd. All in all, you're just paying $60 for a roster update.

On The Xbox One
---------------------------
Prior to buying it for the 360, I thought the graphics for Madden 15 on the Xbox One weren't that great and marginally better than Madden 25 on the 360. After trying it on both the Xbox one and 360, its definitely superior graphically and functionally on the Xbox One. All the new features they market for Madden 15 (such as ""A New Point of View"") are ONLY on the One or PS4, not PS3 or the 360 lol. Talk about a sham and rip-off.

It's good on the One, NOT great.

3,True,"10 15, 2014",A3BZ06T8L9LV8C,B00KVMHSUM,XZero,"The Playstation TV is a case of caveat emptor--in other words, buyer beware. It's a 'know what you're getting' sort of thing. And your enjoyment of it is going to be directly impacted by whether you're fully informed about what it is you're buying.

As other reviewers have noted, the unit itself is roughly the size of a deck of cards. The ""standard"" version comes with only an HDMI cable and the power cable. Physically, it feels well-built and has a sleek look to it. It's practically invisible in my home setup and bears a very tiny footprint.

At launch, this unit is really, truthfully only good for one thing: playing (most) Vita games on the TV. Netflix, Hulu, YouTube--none of them work, so its use as a streaming unit for a second television is nonexistent. This is a huge disappointment because I had fully intended on replacing the Wii in the bedroom with this thing, and now the Wii gets to stay until the PS TV is patched. Do not buy this expecting to replace your Amazon, Google, or other device with a PS TV for streaming purposes, at least not at this date. I'm sure these services will be patched eventually, but there is really no reason for them not to work at launch.

A strange thing I noticed is that it did not seem to want to have a strong connection to my WiFi network despite being relatively close to the router. I have my router in my office, which is on the first floor of my house. The next room over, past a half-bath and a closet, is my living room, which is where my PS3, PS4, and Wii U reside. Those consoles, my iPhone, and my iPad all have a full WiFi signal in that room. Even on the second floor of my house, the connection is quite strong, and my iPad never has any problems streaming video from literally anywhere in the house. It has either a full connection or two out of three bars, even from the furthest point away from the WiFi router one can stand. So why the Playstation TV had only 1 bar of signal strength while literally sitting on top of my Wii U (which had 3/3) is a mystery. Even after turning WiFi off on my phone and iPad and making sure my other consoles were powered down, the signal strength did not improve. No idea what the problem is, but I wanted to point this out for other wireless users in case it is an issue they encounter.

The PS4 to PS TV streaming is choppy. I experienced the same issues other reviewers have noted with attempting to play online games through the streaming functionality. The system worked a little better with games like Knack and Lego Marvel Superheroes, but given the advertising Sony has done with respect to this unit, a consumer can--and frankly should--expect more.

I am the only PSN user in my household, so the multiple PSN accounts on one console issue did not apply to me and I did not experiment with it.

Another issue I want to touch on is Playstation Now, Sony's game streaming service. The beta is accessible through the PS TV. At this date, there are a number of titles available of varying quality. The titles cost anywhere from $2.99 to $6.99 (I believe; some may be more expensive). I did not download them, so I cannot comment on how well the service works. I merely wished to comment regarding the service itself. The essential concept is that of a digital Blockbuster or Redbox. You rent a game for a period of time, generally 90 days, and pay a few dollars for that. You can stream the game and play it in that fashion. Your trophies and save data appear to remain, but once your period expires, you are required to pay another few dollars for the game in the event you wish to continue to play it. Playstation Now is not a service I expect I'll use under its current business model. I'd pay $8/month for unlimited streaming of games akin to Netflix and Hulu. Paying per game to stream games that you never own does not suit my personal style (and, in the interest of full disclosure, I almost never buy digital-only games because I'm one of those old-school gamers who generally won't buy anything that doesn't come in a box on a disc/cartridge/card).

The reason I brought up Playstation Now so extensively is both because it is a feature of Playstation TV and because honestly, with all the console's shortcomings, Sony should give some benefit to those who bought this unit early, such as a selection of free streaming games to sample Playstation Now. As it stands, Playstation Now is a service in which I am not interested, and that's a shame because before experiencing it for myself, I was somewhat hyped for it conceptually. It's more the business model that is a problem, but it is yet another shortcoming in the Playstation TV.

Finally, I'll address the good. Again, this is a 'know what you're buying' situation. I should note that I do not have a PS Vita. Not enough good games out for it to justify the price in my opinion (and most of the good ones are ports of PS3 games I already own). But there are a handful of good ones out there, one of the best being Persona 4 Golden. So yes, despite my displeasure with the problems of the PS TV, I was very happy to fire up Persona 4 Golden last night, especially as someone who absolutely loved Persona 4 on PS2. Yes, Sony needs to add some sort of PS4 controller compatibility so that games like Uncharted can be played despite the lack of touch controls--at the moment, the PS4 controller functions no differently from a PS3 controller.

SUMMARY
+ A cheap alternative to actually buying a Vita for the handful of strong games, particularly JRPGs, on the system
+ Despite being 720p, the visuals on a TV are pretty solid and the games display very well
+ PS3 and PS4 controller support, but no touch support on the PS4 controller

- PS4 to PS TV streaming is poor
- Most video streaming services do not function on the unit at launch
- Weak WiFi connection when compared to every other wireless-enabled device I own
- Playstation Now's business model may create a disincentive for users to try it
- No rubber feet on the unit to hold it in place may create situations where it finds its way behind units because the HDMI and power cables weigh more than the unit itself.

RECOMMENDATION
Do you own a Playstation Vita already? If not, do you want a cheap one that allows you to play games on TV? If the answer to that second question is yes, I do recommend getting the Playstation TV. At launch, its only true use is as a TV-enabled Vita. Until it is hopefully patched in the future, its use as a streaming device is limited. I'm personally relatively happy with my purchase because I've been dying to play Persona 4 Golden and really didn't want to buy a PS Vita. I'm sure there will eventually be other PS Vita games that I want as well.

If you already have a Vita, the Playstation TV will offer  you little more than the gist of the handheld experience on the television, but a stripped down version of it in terms of features. It is not as good as I was personally hoping for it to be, and while I'm sure it'll eventually be patched to improve its functionality and add compatibility to streaming services, this is just not something that can fulfill the purpose for which it is being advertised. It cannot stream PS4 games as well as it should based on Sony's marketing. It cannot stream videos because of incompatibility with streaming services at launch. Playstation Now is underwhelming. There are a lot of factors working against the Playstation TV. It has potential, yes, and that potential has earned it 3 stars in my book instead of 2.

I hope this review has been informative for potential buyers of the Playstation TV. I leave you with this summary: know what you're buying with this unit and see if it fits your needs before dropping the cash on it.",A Decent Mini-Console with Future Potential,1413331200,101,{'Edition:': ' Playstation TV'},
5,True,"12 29, 2015",A1XYD7J0PKGZ8,B00KVOVBGM,mark b,"First off what i wanted to know about this PS4 ,which i really hate nobody ever posts, is the Firmware Version that is installed, when i look for PS3, or a PS4. Well this PS4 model if new/sealed out of the box, does come with ( Firmware/OFW 1.75 ). Now that was my main reason to post & i know others who are looking for this info will be happy to see this info. Coming from a old school gamer, the PS4 in my opinion is a attractive slick looking console from Sony, as in design & power. I believe this model is a older model obviously Vs the Black ops III Limited Edition PS4 console i own. I believe they made some changes for the buttons on BD drive + power in the newer models & which i think also they run a little cooler. Do not quote me on running cooler, but i believe Sony did if i remember correct. The graphics VS the PS3 are improved & PS4 has plenty of memory. I do miss PS3 XMB Vs PS4 though. The suspend app addition which lets to watch a movie & go straight back to the game play or reverse which is a great feature. You can also record in game play & the videos are saved to internal drive. I can go on & on but i think by now people get it & already know what the PS4 has to offer, but i hope they start making more games cause so far PS3 has by far way more good games to play then PS4 has atm.

Another thing NO backwards compatibility supporting my PS3 games. Sony really sucks for this :( 100's of PS3 DISC games i own & now i have to mess around with 2 consoles PS3/PS4 daily just to play my games or other features. Sony ""GREED"" is what you call the leaving out PS3 compatibility game play. If Sony cared at all they would have let the PS4 play PS3 dics which they know it can do, but they just want us to buy the same games all over again. Mainly selling us a service to rent PS3 games. That is SAD & for this i have lost even more respect for Sony. The people who come up with this kind of restrictions SUCK. Because of this ""I NOW BUY LESS PSN CONTENT"" ,that is my payback to Sony, enjoy. I would have been ok with there rent PS3 games service, if the PS4 were backwards compatible, but it's not & so i look down on Sony for this. I am sure because of this the PS4 will be hacked & PS3 game play will be restored! I am just speaking the truth.",Console comes with Firmware/OFW 1.75,1451347200,2,,

The game feels like it's running on the N64 and it's just pathetic in this day and age. The developer even went on saying 20 FPS is the perfect spot for ""action"" games, how pathetic. I love everything else about Bloodborne, the gameplay and music is excellent but the framerate is just the worst I have seen in any PS4 or even PS3 game.

The music is a mix of the greatest hits of all the zelda games, practically. With layers of metal guitar solos to boot. It's dynasty warriors alright, in concert with orchestra. I applaud the sound engineers behind this game. Outstanding.

Gameplay is tight. Hack N Slash? Button Mashing? You could get by with a little of this, but not for long, you have to deploy some strategy in Hyrule Warriors, this is not some beat em up game.

Story? Gannon's back with all the bad guys of the big Zelda games , and you have to reclaim the triforce with the help of Link and friends from other zelda games. So picture a war that must hop along a zelda multiverse. And there you have it.

There's lots of replay value, so when your done beating the main game, you get a special twist at the end that offers you reason to go do it all again, trust me it's cool, but I won't spoil it for you. Just know that it's a bit more challenging.

Ever since Zelda 64 , I've wanted to just go all out and rain havoc on the forces of ganon. Sure, the battle mechanics in all Zelda games like Orcarina Of Time are great. But sometimes you just want to go to war. And if any one deserved to prove himself on the battlefield surrounded by swarms of enemies, it's Link and company. And now you can wage war of epic arcade style proportions.
It's very satisfying and addictive to massacre tons of Gannon's soilders.

I first saw the previews for this game several months ago.  At the time, I thought it looked interesting, but not something that I would want to purchase for myself.  Then, Nintendo put out a ~7 minute video explaining the gameplay, showing how to make simple levels, some of the possibilities.  When I watched that, I immediately purchased it, downloaded it, and eagerly awaited Sept 11 for it to release.

My first impressions are that this is absolutely a brilliant idea.  The premise is that you can make levels using almost any Mario Brothers tool/bad guy/power-up/etc from 4 different Mario games.  Then, you can upload the game for others to play.

Likewise, you can play any map that anyone else has uploaded.  If you very much enjoy someone's map, you can rate it with a Star.  I am not sure what these stars really do for you except get your map better-promoted for others to play.

I have two children who are aged 5 and almost-4.  Most games today are simply too difficult for little children, who have never played any game before, to learn to play.  With Mario Maker, I can design a very simple course for them to use for learning.  Then, as they get more and more proficient, I can introduce the bad-guys, pits they must jump over, cliffs they must manipulate, and so on.

I think it does a good job in cooling the device, and it also protects the exhaust of the device from damage and dust.

I also suspect that people give it a bad review because of how it worked on the 360.

It does make some noise, which is to be expected, but I didn't plug it into the back of my Xbox 1 to use it.  So mine doesn't draw power from the Xbox 1, which makes it work less and thus emit less exhaust.  If you plug it in the back of the system, of course it will work harder and it ""could potentially"" damage the system.

I make sure to remove it from my Xbox 1 when I turn the system off; while it is warm after I pull it off, it isn't as warm as it used to be.  So i consider that a win for me.",Nyko Xbox 1 intercooler,1436140800,,{'Platform:': ' Xbox One'},

In an age where many publishers are releasing/using DLC in controversial ways, Rockstar has proven this generation to be ahead of the pack in releasing substantial, meaningful post-release content, and Undead Nightmare is no different.

You step back into the shoes of John Marston, one of gaming's great characters, and plunge back into the Old West in an apocalyptic adventure that is darker and more grim than Red Dead Redemption.  Flesh eating zombies have infested the landscape of early 20th century Southwestern America and Mexico, and when his wife and child become infected with the plague, John sets out to find out what has happened and to eradicate it once and for all.  Undead Nightmare has something of a survival-horror feel to it.  Since stores and basically the entire economy of the Old West have disappeared in the face of this plague, the only currency that matters is bullets.  Naturally, with hordes of zombies everywhere, you do a lot more shooting in Undead Nightmare than you did in Red Dead Redemption, and this works out very well for the gameplay.  You gain access to your weapons much quicker, and ammunition proves to be a very important element in not just your own survival, but in the survival of other survivors you meet along the way.  Characters from the main game return (sometimes in various forms) and the game has a surprisingly intriguing story, which is something I wasn't expecting.  Like the great zombie movies of the past, there is strong satirical commentary (one woman blames the plague on the USA's refusal to ""close the border"").  The sharp humor from the main game is still here, as are many moments of suspense and terror that bring a new element to the game world.

All the great gameplay from the original game is here.  The entire game world is still here, albeit transformed to appear much more ruined.  Your dead eye gauge (which slows down time to let you get more accurate shots) fills much faster to help you deal with the undead hordes everywhere.  There are some excellent moments with the native wildlife, who have also become stricken with the plague, and new mechanics are introduced, as well as new weapons.  Altogether here, there is about 8-10 hours of additional content, not including every side mission as well as added multiplayer content.  Rockstar has set a great example here on how to add content to a game that really breathes new life into it and gives excellent value for the money.

It's not so much that this is a bad game by any means, but rather that it's not the type of ""Giant open-world MMORPG"" or anything else that it's been promoted as.  At best, this game is a 1-3 player co-op shooter game with optional deathmatch mode.  There is no communication between players, very little secret content, small levels, little equipment / loot, next to no story, very unimaginative characters / plot / weapons and very linear character customization.  RPGs and Shooters are about the only 2 types of games I play and in no way will this game make any RPG player happy.  For a game with a supposed $500 million dollar budget, I can't help but wonder where that money went, because it definitely didn't end up in this game.

The lack of day 1 reviews on this game I believe have nothing to do with the fact that this game is so huge (it isn't) or that you need players for it to work (you don't) but rather that the developers know this game is going to get hammered in the ratings and want their pre-orders filled first before people flock to gamestop to drop their copy off for $5-$10.

- Side missions to help you level up in case you are having a hard time with some enemy or other. In Destiny, you can redo old missions or go to an arena where Bill Nighy drones on about retaking area A or B.

The shoulder buttons are a bit stiff and it's small for people with large hands, but the buttons will get worn in with use and most people will be able to hold it comfortably. It's exactly the same size as a Gamecube controller and a bit more comfortable due to the different shaping on the back side. It's also lighter, but doesn't feel cheap.

The sticks are more like the stick on the Gamecube controller, with the Octogon shaped setting. The second stick is better than the old c-stick.

Great to have for that one Smash or Mario Cart player that claims they'd wreck everyone else playing instead of losing if they were playing on the Gamecube.

One thing to note though, it does work with the Wii U, but does not work with several games. It emulates the Classic Controller and no the Pro Controller, so it will not work with games that don't support the Classic Controller for the Wii U. This means it's useless for Hyrule Warriors, ZombiU, and Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge, or any game that only supports the Wii U's Pro Controller. There are several so be aware that this isn't going to work for every game on the new system.

So if you're buying it as an alternate controller for the Wii U, be aware that it's not going to replace your Pro Controller. The Classic Pro Controller is not the same thing as the Wii U Pro Controller.

If you're looking for an alternative to the Pro Controller because the button placement sucks look into the Nykon Pro Commander and not this one. It's a great controller, but not what you're looking for if that is the case.","Well made, comfortable to hold, and works as a great alternative to the Classic and Classic Pro Controller.",1420761600,,{'Color:': ' Mario'},

This is sold as a hybrid mechanical keyboard. It feels nothing like a mechanical keyboard. There is no clickiness to it. You press the keys smoothly till they bottom out. They key caps are closer to the style you often find on mechanical keyboards, but this is a membrane keyboard through and through. Membrane keyboards are cheaper and more liquid resistent. I currently have 3 mechanical keyboards and there's no comparison. I'm not saying this is a bad keyboard--but if you want a mechanical, get a mechanical!

That being said, this is a very nice backlit keyboard. I wanted a wired keyboard for the computer the kids use in the living room and I wanted it to be backlit so it can be used when others are watching movies. I also didn't want a mechanical because I wanted a quieter keyboard. This fits all my needs and is a nice keyboard!

Also, I have three girls who LOVE the rainbow colors. You have six different options of different types of motion or two options of solid color. There is barely any customization for the six motion options except you can sometimes change whether it moves right to left or left to right. You can also always change the brightness. All of the motions are too quick for me, but the kids love them.

The two options that aren't motion are solid color all across the keyboard and one where you can program each of the six zones to different colors. I don't think programming the zones to different colors is worth it because if the keyboard is unplugged or the computer is turned off, the settings are all reset. I just use the solid color option myself.

Each key does not have it's own backlight. There are six zones from left to right across the keyboard. This doesn't really matter, but it means you can't just light up wasd or anything like that. The backlight is very bright, so having the zones doesn't cause issues unless you expect to be able to light specific keys only. The good side of that is because it's so simple you don't have software to install, and you can set it however you want with a couple of keystrokes.

The biggest downside is that it doesn't save your settings if power is lost or it's unplugged. Not only that, the default setting is a rainbow motion setting. It would be nice if the default setting was a solid color option, but all I have to do to fix it is to hit ""FN-5"". So it isn't too bad.

Overall, I like it pretty well and my kids love it. We had a pretty boring keyboard before this, but it go messed up by spills over time.

Xbox One, no Kinect: $349
- Barebones, nothing extra, not a great deal, don't get this one.

Xbox One with Kinect: $449
- Same as above, but includes Kinect. No other bonuses, don't get this bundle.

Xbox One Assassin's Creed Bundle, no Kinect: $349
- This includes both Assassin's Creed black flag (digital version), which is playable immediately after download, and Assassin's Creed Unity, which you can pre-download, but it is not playable until release date, which is still 1-2 weeks away. As you can see, this is the same price as the barebones XBO, but includes 2 free games, making it a pretty sweet deal if you don't care about the Kinect.

Xbox One Assassin's Creed Bundle, with Kinect: $449
- Same as other AC bundle above, but also includes Kinect. It also includes a free Kinect game: Dance Central Spotlight. The Kinect sells separately alone for $149 MSRP, so this is an *extremely* good bundle. The standard MSRP prices would put this value at $399 console + $149 Kinect + $30 AC Black Flag + $60 AC Unity + $20 Dance Central Spotlight = about $650 total. Even if you believe the separate prices are kind of inflated, or they go down further over time, still a great deal.

Xbox One Sunset Overdrive Bundle: $349
- This bundle does not include a Kinect, but includes the new Sunset Overdrive game for the same price as the barebones bundle. But what makes this one stand out is that both the console and controller are white, which is pretty cool. Color preferences are subjective, so you'll need to look at it and decide if this bundle is right for you, or if Sunset Overdrive is the type of game you'll like. It is currently the only way to get a white XBO. If you really want the Kinect, you'll have to buy it separately for $149, which makes the deal less awesome. But if you don't care about Kinect and like the look of white, this is a great choice.

Xbox One Call of Duty Advanced Warfare Bundle: $449
- This bundle is priced the same as the normal Kinect bundle, but this one does not actually include the Kinect. Instead, that $100 premium gets you Call of Duty Advanced Warfare (digital version, not physical), a custom Call of Duty themed console and controller design, and a 1TB hard drive. This is the only way to currently get a 1TB hard drive, which to me is the biggest selling point of all. But again, if you want the Kinect, you'll have to buy it separately for $149 which makes it not as great of a deal. But that 1TB is great, and with how large full games are, will quickly become necessary. I'm hoping 1TB becomes a standard hard drive size very soon for this console, but for now, you'll have to get this bundle to get that extra space (or get a separate external drive).

Note that the included Sunset Overdrive game is digital only, there is no physical game disc included. It is also a very huge file, so plan on either starting the download before bed, or waiting patiently for a few hours for it to download and install.

It is noticably lighterweight than pretty much every controller I've experienced. This lightness comes at a cost though- a barely existant rumble feature, and no motion sensor. Two features that I like and that are on many other controllers. Of course, these are the sacrafices for an 80 hour battery life. While the shape of the controller makes it feel comfortable in hand, the D-pad and ABXY buttons feels jagged underthumb. Another baffling thing is that the trigger buttons aren't pressure sensetive. They're either at 1 or at 0 with no difference in between. I don't know how exactly they're supposed to attract ""hardcore gamers"" lacking this feature. Also, my controller creeks like the floorboards in a haunted house. This all combined with the lack of games available to play it is why I'm giving it 2 stars.

Word to the wise, I would put some serious consideration into whether you need this controller before you buy it. Most Wii U games don't support it and you can't always tell whether they will or not from the backs of the games.

So, I just found this thrid-party controller- http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Controller-Wii-Nintendo-U-6304900/dp/B009D4JW3U/ref=pd_bxgy_vg_img_y

It's supposed to work as a wii-mote, a wii-classic pro controller, and a wii-pro controller. And it's supposed to work with the Wii and the Wii U. And it's 15 bucks cheaper than this controller. Lord knows, I don't know if it'll be any good or not. Third party controllers are notoriously hit-or-miss, but I'm going to try it out and see what comes. I only wish Nintendo had thought to combine all the features of those controllers into the pro-controller first. I really hope they re-release the procontroller in the future with a better rumble, motion sensor, and wii/virtual console backwards compatability.

As soon as you first setup your New 3DS, you must do a Data Transfer from your old 3DS (or 3DS LL) to the New Nintendo 3DS before you continue. Also don't forget that the New Nintendo 3DS (and XL) doesn't include an AC Adapter, yet this time around it uses micro SDHC cards to save your games and player data. You must keep your 3DS AC Adapter to recharge the new system.

As for the Amiibo figures, Amiibos are Amiibos. No matter where they come from, they all work the same even on the New 3DS/XL from anywhere, American or International. Even my brand new Peach amiibo I tested works perfectly fine. I'm already loving my New 3DS so much and it's been a month now.

Lets get the obvious out of the way and say its not a survival horror game. I would call this an action horror game. The fact that you always have someone else with you is annoying and kills any sort of suspense or dread the game might have been trying to build. Moira is more of an annoyance then anything else and the fact that all she does is shine a flashlight to ""find"" items and swings a melee weapon makes her basically useless. It feels like busy work every time you have to use a companion character. The enemies are fast, nimble and they usually throw at least 2 or 3 of them at you at a time. STOP doing survival horror games in episodes! I was one of those people that was still holding out hope that we might get a decent RE title but IMO nothing in the series has lived up to the name since Nemesis. Some people think that RE4 was the apex of the series but I looked at that as the turning point in which the games were never the same. Its safe to say I'm done with this series.

1. Poor voice recognition, It won't understand your voice if you don't speak with an american twang IMO.
2. Very Very few worthwhile games and apps.
3. The fact that its always on as long as the Xbox is and is constantly watching you and hearing you is quite creepy.

5. Doesn't come with a TV mount.

Summary:A brilliant product... If it did what it is supposed to do. It looks good, works well (when it does) and is useful in some ways but it is severely hampered by lack of games and semi functional voice recognition. Also mounting and privacy screens are an additional cost if you want them.

The battery packs fit in snug, the replacement battery door cover fits well and it doesn't take long to charge up the battery.  I like that the holder has two positions for charging and one for if it's not needing a charge.  The bottom charge status lights (green/red) are easy to see and add a nice accent color people might like depending on their setup.

There are two design flaws however

First is what many others have already said, there aren't aren't any guides to line up the battery contacts with the contacts on the holder.  So you have to fumble with it a bit until the light comes on.  I'm sure over time users will learn the best way to drop the controller in and minimize 'misses'.

The second flaw is I wish the controllers went in triggers down instead of palm rest down. The reason being is if you have a chatpad or headset adapter or whatever else plugged into the controller, it must be removed first before you can put the controller on the dock.  If they went in triggers down, you could leave those accessories connected to charge.","Good charger, chatpad/chat adapters need to be removed for charging though",1449705600,,"{'Edition:': ' Charger', 'Platform:': ' Xbox One'}",

I probably wouldn't recommend this mouse. To save some people time, the main issue I have with this mouse is that after a month or two of use it stops tracking randomly at any time even in games and you either have to unplug it and plug it back in or wait 5-15 seconds for it to start working again. This appears to be an issue many people have had; I remember seeing reviews about it before I bought it and decided to take the risk. By comparison, I bought a Razer Deathadder Chroma on May 18, 2016 and haven't had any problems yet. My brother also bought a Deathadder Chroma on Oct. 20, 2016 and hasn't had problems yet. Although I love the Deathadder I think I'll be trying the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum to replace this Naga Hex V2 just to get some experience with another well known brand.
See below for a detailed comparison/review.

**This review will be mostly a comparison between the Razer Naga Hex V2 and the Razer Deathadder Chroma.**
I bought this mouse on July 12, 2017 on sale for $42.89 after tax and it looks like it's on sale for ~$45 now so this might be a good time to review it. I've been using it almost every day with my desktop PC for anywhere from 30 minutes to 6+ hours of constant movement and clicking. This includes simple tasks like spreadsheets, YouTube, Netflix etc. as well as more intense use like MOBA and FPS games. I bought it partially because it was on sale and partially because I needed a mouse for my laptop (I switched my Deathadder Chroma from my desktop to my laptop).
I'll start with the positives. This mouse looks great, and since I already had the software installed it was fairly quick to set up. It does of course have more options than the Deathadder, specifically in reference to the side buttons. The Deathadder is limited to 2 side buttons which I use to adjust DPI on the fly and I believe that's the default setting , but they can be changed. The Naga Hex V2 however puts these buttons behind the scroll wheel and adds an additional 7 side buttons that can be programmed to pretty much any combination of keys you can think of, I also like having a place to rest my thumb in the middle of the buttons. Both the Deathadder and the Naga Hex V2 allow you to change the colors.

Ok now for a few negatives (sort of). The first major difference I noticed when switching from the Deathadder to the Naga Hex V2 was that this mouse tends to promote more of a palm grip while the Deathadder seems to be better suited for a finger/claw grip. This made the Naga feel odd at first but I got used to it and it's perfectly comfortable even though my hands are fairly small for a guy; so in the end no issue there. The second problem I had was the organization of the 7 side buttons; looking at the side of the mouse directly, the keys go in order of 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5, 4 clockwise. Personally I found this made it harder to get used to the buttons but then again I've never been a big user of programmable mouse buttons so maybe more experienced users won't have a problem. Another thing I realized is that I prefer the DPI quick switching to be on the side for easier access so if you want that you'll have to program 2 of the side keys to do it. Oddly enough accidentally pressing the DPI buttons seems to happen to me the same amount regardless of whether I use the Naga or the Deathadder, but it's rare in both cases. These issues are negligible and I'd probably give this mouse 4 stars at the ~$80 or 5 stars at the ~$45 price if it wasn't for the tracking issue I mentioned at the start of this review.

But what you really have here is a top in its class gaming mouse.  For those new to high end gaming mouses, they have amazing customization potential. So there is a bit of a set up and learning curve with these.  For those familiar with these mouses, there is nothing really new other than improvement on design and functionality.

I like that this mouse is wired.  Wireless mouses and controllers are good, but they have a lovely tendency to die out suddenly when out of charge (especially ps4 controllers...).  A huge plus with wired is that you won't lose connectivity due to a bluetooth error.  And theoretically no slow down of inputs to data to the game.  A seamless and instant reaction time.

Razer has been making excellent gaming mouses that are tried and true with FPS games.  This mouse works well with a variety of other games, but really FPS gamers are the target audience. Especially competition gamers.

Every button can be configured to do something other than its default configuration. And that level of configuration can be made ridiculously granular. The Sabre's software has a very detailed macro system that can even move the position of the mouse cursor in addition to passing key strokes and mouse clicks.

The mouse tracks with a laser optical system that is very accurate and responsive. There are dpi settings to give very fine controls all the way to a super-fast 8200 dpi. There are five default positions that can be set and toggled, with the added option of a 'sniper mode' to slow the mouse down for only as long as a button is held.

Although it's designed as a gaming peripheral it can really be of value to professionals too. Given that it can send keystrokes, mouse clicks, and more, it could be a helpful tool for video and photo editors who want to pass keystrokes without having to reach back to the keyboard.

I covered a small portion of the level of configuration detail in the video, but it can do a lot more than what I demo here.

The hardware is very light weight (about 3.5 ounces) and comfortable in the hand. It has a nice cloth USB cable that won't tangle very easily.

My only gripe is that it doesn't have configuration software on the Mac or Linux. It's strictly Windows only at the moment.

Overall it is still a decent value, but I recommend other entries in the series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Masters-Legends-of-Terror/dp/B0099F855O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Masters: Legends of Terror</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Masters-Wicked-Worlds-Collection/dp/B00C694JUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Masters: Wicked Worlds Collection</a>

First off, buy an anti-glare protector for your screen. There are plenty of great (and cheap) screen protectors on Amazon you can buy. Since I bought one with mine I never experienced the issues with the screen glare than many have reported.

The picture quality is great. I played 8 hours of Witcher 3 on this as well as the last chapter of Tales from the Borderlands on my PS4. The quality of plastic feels cheaper, but not so bad you feel like its going to break. There is an included ""screen cover/stand"" (seen in the products picture) that I wish was better quality, but it is what it is and its still effective. I'm not well versed in tuning screens to make the picture quality the absolutely best, but I found the quality to be great.

There are no speakers on the device but included is a usb cable and power adapter and a (rather small) HDMI cable. Both of these cables are way shorter than most people need them to be so you might need to invest $10-20 on a longer USB cable and HDMI (both can be found for pretty cheap). There is also a headphone jack for your headphones or speakers, but if you play on a PS4 you can simply plug some headphones into the controller (same for the WiiU as well, I think).

No idea how well made the backpack for this is as I bought the screen by itself. For the price I think this is pretty good travel screen for gamers.",Have screen will travel...,1445558400,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

I was super excited to hear that it was to be released on the 3DS so I could play the whole entire game. I pre-ordered it and practically counted down the days until it would arrive on my front porch. If you can tell by my 5 star review, I was not disappointed in the slightest.
Majora's Mask works well on a portable system. I feel like this is a game that is enjoyable to play in small pieces and then pick up the next day. It has updated graphics and it looks absolutely beautiful and runs smoothly. This game has a lot of re-playability because of the many side quests to complete and items to collect. There are only four dungeons to complete but they are all fun to complete and feature interesting creatures and stories.
Majora's Mask is one of the greatest video game of all time that lacks the universal appeal of Ocarina of Time. But there is a lot to get out of it.

People seem to prefer the G710+ for gaming because the keys can be pressed with less force and have a faster response feel. I actually like the tactile response of the strong click that comes with the G710 for gaming, so I keep it at home. I keep the G710+ at the office as I am typing far more throughout the day, and I can begin to feel strain on my joints using the G710 all day.

First I must say that the majority of the experience using this keyboard is due to the company that produces the Cherry MX keys that are under the keys. Logitech has produced their own mechanical switches on their newer models, but this one uses the same keys that can be found on many other keyboards.

I will focus my review specifically on areas that where under Logitech's control. I feel that the first area that needs major improvement is the software for programming the keyboard. It looks very outdated, and although the functionality is there, its not particularly user friendly by today's standards. Honestly, I haven't really found a need to use the macro keys on the left hand side of the keyboard because most program's today be it Visual Studio, Photoshop, or Maya already have programmed easy to use hotkeys or key combinations that don't require you to use anything more than the main keyboard. Also, for gaming I don't see much use for a separate set of keys because the games where I would care for that type of performance I would rather keep my hand stationary. I'm not skilled enough to play the keyboard like a piano, moving my hand around to different positions without losing my spot and having to look down.

That being said the unit feels excellent to use. It has enough weight that it absolutely won't move around while you are using it.

The green really matches well like the Mario version, as well as the official Mario one that came bundled with the Mario Kart 8 Bundle when it originally launched.

So this is third party, however it is officially licensed. So it's expected to work well, and let me say that it does.

I tested this with Mario kart 8 and it worked great. I was able to drift boost out of corners and attack the courses like I normally would in a controller. Granted it took me a race to get use to it, but after a lap I was up to my usual snuff.

However there is only ONE complaint I have about this. The L is a nice touch, however I wish instead it said Wii like the official one. Next is the back being a solid all green; instead of brown with a yellow circle around the Wii logo. However I won't take it against it. Also I find it odd that there's a bit of a dip on the where the Wii-mote's sensor LED's display out to the sensor. Maybe it's for better range when navigating the Wii main menu, but it makes it look odd to me.

*EDIT2*
I've just completed my battery drain test.  A little before 9.5 hours had elapsed I started getting low battery warnings.  At almost exactly 9.5 hours the headset shut itself off.  I used the following settings:
'Plugged' in to my computer using the audio cable (so not using bluetooth)
Played movies pretty much continuously for the duration (I maybe missed 5-10 minutes max).
Noise Cancellation ON
Sound Preset: Movies - 'Signature Sound'
No intentional microphone utilization (I didn't turn the mic off, so it may have been picking up ambient background noise)
Started from a fully charged state (ie - charged it, took it off the charging station, and started using it immediately)

This is slightly worse than the 10 hours I was expecting.  If using bluetooth I'd expect even lower battery life.  I'm not terribly impressed with this, given that other headsets offer longer battery life (and given that this is a $300 headset).
-------

Before I start this review, three important points to note:
1) I do not own an XBox One (though I want one :D ), and so I couldn't test out the pairing functionality.  From everything I've read and understood it should work flawlessly though.  I was able to test every other aspect of the headphones.
2) I was comparing these against several other gaming headsets I've reviewed and have by me: The Corsair Vengeance 2100 (a wireless 7.1 gaming headset with mic boom), and the Turtle Beach Z60 (a wired 7.1 gaming headset with mic boom).  I also compared it against some very high end Sony Earbuds.
3) I fully expected to give these a bad review based solely on the price (a $300 headset meant to be used with a $350 gaming system? What?  At the time of review I could get an xbox one system + the halo master chief collection for $350.  If I was to get it at walmart I'd get a free controller thrown in).

So, on to the review:

Sound Quality - 5/5: The first and most important aspect of any headphone set is the sound quality, and the 800X blew me away.  Its noticeably richer than my other headsets in the depth of sound it presented.  The different preset sound modes offer very different sound mixes, so you'll want to experiment until you find your preference for each type of media your consuming.  The headset is advertised as being able to bring to the forefront some soft background sounds (like footsteps and such for FPS gaming) and I found that, in my estimation, it does so.  That said, you'll want to be careful when listening to music most of the preset sound modes will push some frequencies noticeably more than others (and overall I noticed a much stronger bass here than in other headsets).
Interestingly, this wasn't my favorite headset: the Sony XBA-2 earbuds are.  They provide a more balanced sound and I prefer earbuds in general.  However, I realize that this is wholly a personal preference, and in the world of gaming headsets that I've used the Elite 800X are king - as they should be, for $300!

Comfort - 4/5: The earcups are a nice foam type material that is not only very comfortable, but will also stay clean (fabrics can absorb sweat or pet hair caught in them, this material won't have those problems).  For wireless headphones they seem fairly heavy, but the weight ended up feeling very distributed on my head, and I thought they were much more comfortable than the other pair of wireless headphones I tested - the Corsair Vengeance 2100.  There being no mic boom is a nice extra on the comfort front as well - eating is easier.  However, I found that after extended use (around 2 hours) the top of the headband started hurting my head a bit.  I'm fairly confident that this is due to the shape of my head and how the headphones were resting on me, so I don't see it as a huge issue for most.

Mic Performance - 5/5: I've never used a mic not on a boom before, and this one seemed to work great.  It picked up my voice well and I was generally understandable.  This is obviously not a studio quality mic, but it gets the job done for gaming.

Design - 5/5: The headset has a nice clean look to it, with green stripes (and a green LED logo on the base to indicate charging; red when charging, green when charged).  The Elite 800 is bue for playstation, and the 800X is green for XBox.  I prefer the styling on this headset to my other gaming headsets, design preferences are usually personal preferences.

Ease of Use - 3/5: This is where the headset fails most, in my opinion.  The good is wireless charging.  This is a lot more convenient than I expected it to be - I didn't realize how annoying it was to plug/unplug a charging cable until I didn't have to do it anymore.  The bad is the control schema.  You've got 4 buttons on each earpiece, and memorizing where each button is and operating each button can be very annoying.  If you don't consistently use the headset you'll easily forget where specific buttons are.  Even if you do consistently use it I found that the buttons depress far too easily.  I've switched modes when I didn't want to, turned off noise cancellation when I was trying to do something else, etc.  The worst part is that often the buttons have 'modes' - a quick depress to do one thing, a long depress to do something else.  I would have much preferred a higher actuation force, and fewer buttons (instead of having a volume up and a volume down button, for example, a volume roller would have been much better).

Battery Life - 4/5: This is partly going off of other reviews, as I haven't worn the battery down yet (despite several hours of consecutive use).  This is rated for something like 10 hours, which is more than sufficient for gaming sessions.  On the flip side, if you want to use this is as your primary headset (when traveling and such) then 10 hours is likely not sufficient.  *edit* I completed a battery life test (see the top of this review), and got 9.5 hours of battery life.

'Extras' - 5/5: There are a few other features that this headset has.  The first is noise cancellation - this works about as well as any other noise cancellation I've tested.  Most background noises are dulled out, though you can still hear directed sound quite well.  Its useful for getting rid of ambient noise.  The second is the different connection methods: There is a cable you can use to hook up to anything and get sound, at the expense of mic functionality.  It has bluetooth for wireless connectivity to any bluetooth enabled device: this gives you sound and mic capabilities.  You can even use this to answer a bluetooth phone, if you'd like!
The box it comes in is nice enough to be mentioned as an extra; its pretty and has nice padding.
Finally, there is the Turtle Beach Elite club.  I didn't get a membership # with my headset so I couldn't test this, however you supposedly can get new plates for the side of the headset, an extended warranty, better support, and some free swag (shirts and such).  I don't want to say these types of extras should be expected, but for such an expensive gaming headset ... well, there had better be something (because the sound quality is not going to be as good as a dedicated music headset).

Overall:
Overall, if you have an XBox One, want a wireless headest, and are willing to pay a hefty premium, then this is the headset for you.  Period.  For a gaming headset it has great sound quality, for a wireless headset its relatively comfortable, and the battery lasts long enough for pretty much any gaming session.
However, the caveat here is that if you just want a dedicated headset you can get cheaper ones with better sound quality, the battery doesn't last long enough to use this as a travel headset except with shorter trips, and the controls will be annoying unless you're willing to dedicate a lot of time to them.
By itself this is definitely a five star product.  However the fact that it costs about as much as the system you're going to use it for means its not for everyone.  Personally, I don't really feel that most will be able to justify the price.
If you're looking for great sound quality then a good speaker system will be better, and you can use any standalone mic solution for your mic.  If you live somewhere where a speaker system isn't practical, then you're probably either a college student, or have roommates in your apartment, or similar ... and if we're being honest, not all of those demographics can really afford a $300 headset.

Due to the poor (in my opinion) control scheme and the battery life supposedly not lasting more than 10 hours, this goes down to a 4 star product in my opinion, given the cost.  If this was cheaper it'd be a 5 star product, or if the battery life lasted longer, or if the control scheme was better.

All of that said:
I am currently running a drain test on the headset.  I started from a fully charged state and will just be cycling through movies and such using noise cancellation and the headset's 'signature sound for movies' preset - no mic usage for this test.  If the headset ends up lasting substantially more than 10 hours I'll likely edit my review up to 5 stars.  *edit* I completed the battery life test and got 9.5 hours - see the top of this review.

*edit* My pictures apparently got turned upside down and sideways and such when uploaded... I'll see if I can fix it.","Amazing Sound and Wireless Experience, but High Price makes this a Niche Product",1428537600,12,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71E1FeBz5rL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CVtBfaBkL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71O9BOQzfFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71z6ZU4bHEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71qC6Y9CZ6L._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+dzASQ5GL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zMtoHU-WL._SY88.jpg']"

I'm sure most people already know, but I initially wasn't aware that this wasn't your typical RPG, namely that you upgrade your equipment rather than gaining levels and skills. However, although I thought it wouldn't be as fun, I found myself really enjoying it just as much as the standard RPG. One thing it has over games like Final Fantasy or Persona is that grinding has more of a purpose, as you need monster materials to craft better weapons.

The part that I really have enjoyed so far is the expanse of information that goes into this game. You can definitely play through it without ever looking things up and just hacking away at things, but I really like the weapon designs so of course I look up which weapons not only look the best, but perform as well. The weapon trees expand so far that it's hard to just pick which one you want to use in the end. That, and there are so many weapon types, each with their own nuances.

I'm not too far into the game yet, so I don't know how much more on the content I can review. I will say I find the dialogue a little boring, and it doesn't help that the voices are in some kind of gibberish rather than any known language. Is this something that is consistent in all the MH games? I also turn the volume off when I'm buying stuff from the shops. You can only listen to a shopkeep saying ""Hi!"" (or ""Hrii!"") every couple seconds for so long. Sometimes the random Palico meowing or the strained breathing from sprinting annoys me, too, but that's why I play with my own music on. Not taking a star off because I feel like all the sound-related stuff might just be me.

5,False,"02 27, 2015",A33A18ZPG0S6QZ,B00SX9UD8E,CriticalBill,"Hunting monsters has been a decade long pastime for many gamers since the first Monster Hunter released back in 2004 on the PlayStation 2.  Over those years, the games have up the ante and tweaked several aspects of the game to improve the monster hunting experience, and with the recent release of Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate for the 3DS, the hunt is even more enjoyable and a great access point for beginners looking to topple their first monster.

Monster Hunter's gameplay can best be described as an action role playing game (RPG) with deep roots into set collecting.  Where Monster Hunter (MH) differs from most RPGs is in the leveling system.  There isn't a single level to gain that's more commonly found in RPGs.  Rather than add some stat points to damage or defense after a required amount of points are met, here the amount of damage and defense that carry you throughout the game ties into the weapons and armor your equipped with that are made up with parts of the monsters you fight.  That's where the set collection comes in.

The monsters you'll be fighting to farm their parts to make new weapons and armor are outstanding.  Each one is animated to life, and it doesn't matter if it's a small raptor looking dinosaur to a giant stone dragon, each one has their own set of moves and qualities to them.  It's easy to classify each one as a boss fight, learning their patterns, weaknesses, and preparing for the fight are a must.  As you kill or capture these beasts, you'll accumulate parts from them to build/forge and upgrade weapons and armor each that reflect the monster in which they came from.  If the monster does poison and you make a hammer from its parts, it'll have poison stats associated with it.  The one, and only, warning I give new players is the grinding nature of the game.  If your not a fan of grinding the same monster...hoping for that one reward/part you need to finish it's set of armor...than this game may/will get underskin.

The gameplay has been revamped this go around and the results make the game even more thrilling than ever before.  The simple addition of having vertical terrain along with the new gameplay mechanic to allow a hunter to mount a monster never gets old.  Now hunter rush up the side of cliff sides and vault over lower terrain of the maps, giving you an opportune time to strike down a monster from above.  Added in is also the new glaive weapon that even allows you to pole vault up in the air for similar results.

The game also makes the single player ""story"" more streamlined and fun to follow.  I use the word story loosely since the game is still lacking real depth but there are more cinematics and events tossed throughout the campaign to make it more than the previous outtings.  The game also has expedition quests that charge you with scouting out the area and local monsters.  Multiplayer has always been a blast in the MH series and now the game is easier to get in and out of the multiplayer segments than in the past and teaming up with 3 other friends is always fun way to go hunting.

Nintendo's New 3DS system makes good use of the included circle pad pro but older models that have the add-on will still work with the game.  The touchpad can be customized with different layouts to what best suites your needs along with provide you with shortcuts to the multiplayer and locations.  The new system's faster processing makes loading screens.....an issue with past installments...mere seconds and not even noticeable.

In the end, if you're a veteran monster hunter and rabid fan or just a curious consumer looking for a game that's easily worth the money, than I highly recommend this game for a purchase.  Good luck in your future hunts.",New or Old Hunters Welcomed,1424995200,2,{'Edition:': ' Standard'},

You get to play 5 different races, all of which are accurate to the lore, but the only ones that can transform outside of Kaioken are, you guessed it, the Saiyans.  As someone who is playing a member of the Frieza Clan, that's really, really disappointing.

The game also has a very bad difficulty curve.  You'll go from feeling challenged but not punished in the beginning, to crushed by juiced enemies that have the Shao Khan ""can't be staggered by attacks"" problem to make up for shoddy AI, then against wimpy opponents, then back to supercharged ""can't be staggered by attacks"" enemies again.  Pretty much after the Freeza saga all balance in the game vanishes.  It's sad.

The AI is really poor too.  In most scenarios it's passable, but more than once have I gotten cheesed by the AI tag-teaming me into stun locks even in matches that are 2v2s.  Sometimes my partners will just crush the enemy team, leaving me doing very little, other times they're just chores for me to revive constantly.

This feels like a game that either ran out of budget or was rushed out, because it's got potential, but it shirks it.  I'll probably play it to 100% completion, but there isn't a whole lot that's going to keep me coming back to this game.",Your mileage may vary.,1425427200,2,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PC Online Game Code'}",

Now for the mouse. I love it. Ergonomically it's very comfortable and the 6 buttons are in the exact places need them. I do not have large hands so how it fits you may be different. The buttons click very nicely. The color scheme with its 16.8 billion different colors is an attractive addition but matters little. All surfaces are smooth, meaning no rubber covering or textures. Under heavy play those with sweaty hands may have issues.

The pixart 3366 laser chip is the most accurate laser on the market so the speed and accuracy is the best you'll find. I have the Logitech G5 gaming mouse (an awesome mouse) and this much less expensive G303 is just as fast if not faster.

The interactive software (which you can download from their website product support page) is easy to use, allows you to program the mouse, change the colors and change the speed and accuracy. Works with most operating systems.

I've read some complaints about the cable and I disagree with them.  The cable is braided but very smooth. It's seven feet long so it can reach a good distance for desktop users. It will but bind if you dress the cable properly. Use a velcro strip or weight the cable down so it will have a lose feel so it will not bind during play.

Overall this is a great entry level mouse.  I'm going to stick with my G5 because I like a heavier weight (the G5 has adjustable weights) and I like the feel of the rubber grips and the placement of the buttons. My kids will love this G303 so we'll get a lot of use from it. I'm still using my Logitech Trackman mouse so I know first hand of the great build quality of Logitech products.

I originally intended for it to just be a controller for the SFV beta (as PS3 sticks are not supported), and then for it to be taken apart to ""pad hack"" my current fightstick. I've adjusted to this pad alarmingly quick though. I'm questioning if I prefer it even. I would be extatic if by the time SFV comes out I could save myself $200 and skip out a TE stick for one of these. Not to mention how much more convenient it would be to haul one of these around instead of an 8 pound stick.

The build quality on this pad is the most solid I've ever used. No pad previously has even began to convince me to consider switching. The Madcatz pad's D-Pad was far too floaty for my taste, and while I rather liked the PDP pad's feel (and price!) it tends to fall apart after a good 5 minutes of use. Unacceptable, and explains the price tag of $10. The rigidity of the D-Pad on the FC4 is phenomenal. Fireballs and Dragon punches come out with ease. The buttons feel quite solid in construction, including the triggers, that just feel like more buttons.

The only major flaw I can think of with this pad is the lack of a touchpad button. This can be frustrating for some PS4 fighting games, as sometimes menus may require the press of a touchpad to access a certain menu. In USFIV for example, you cannot access the button configuration menu from the character select screen with this pad. I could see possible frustration there in a tournament setting especially.

All in all this thing is a solid 9/10 and an incredible bargain. Save yourself some money before dropping $150+ on a PS4 enabled fightstick! You might just fall in love like me!",I can honestly say that I never thought I'd switch BACK to pad from stick but...,1438041600,35,,

The MCC bundle includes all 4 halo games, so you won't find Halo Reach, Wars, or any other non numbered Halos here. This package brings a nostalgia to the old days. Every single game runs at 1080p 60FPS except for Halo 2 anniversary. Speaking of that, Halo 2 has been completely remastered. The visuals look like something coming out of a next gen console, instead of 10 year old hardware. Halo MCC has had a myriad of issues with multiplayer, but it's been much better now. I can get into matches more possibly, but it's still not perfect. But given the 45 campaign missions on all the 4 Halos, I would forgive it a little bit more. Halo 3 and 4 still look the same, but runs at 1080p 60FPS now. Halo 1 Combat Evolved Anniversary is also ported into this game from 3 years ago. Also there are some extras like the Halo Nightfall digital series and the Halo 5 Guardians Multiplayer Beta, which unfortunately already ended.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this bundle. Getting 4 games for free on one collection is great. The Xbox One is a solid option for a next gen console.

3,False,"09 1, 2015",AXUJFOFQZNTN,B00UOYQ5DS,J. Tant,"I like this controller, though not without some issues.

Mainly, it has to do with cross-platform compatibility.  The description says it is for Android/PC.  Well, I'm primarily a PC gamer so that's what interested me in this controller.  To be sure, it paired easily with my PC and I was able to calibrate it just fine save for one problem...the LT/RT buttons didn't work.  No matter what game I tried, neither button would work.  I couldn't even get it to work in the calibration routines.  So that was a bit of a disappointment.

Second nit was actually using it for PC games.  I got it to work after a fashion, but it's not really compatible out of the box.  For example, I set it up with the Lego Batman game.  The game did not recognize the controller, but I was able to configure it as a custom controller and manually assign buttons/sticks to the various functions of the game.  Once it's configured I think it's OK (again, notwithstanding the nonfunctional LT/RT buttons) but it is a bit of a headache to get it going.  I did find the controls responsive and the overall controller was comfortable for me to hold, so I think that's a definite plus.  I found the controls that I had set up to be precise and I was able to do well in controlling Batman.  The control buttons (A B X Y) have very light tactile feedback to them and don't offer a lot of resistance to pressing them, which I found to be a definite plus.

As PC gaming was the primary reason I wanted to test this controller, I wasn't prepared to use this for a smartphone game.  The included clip did hold my phone securely and the overall effect is rather, I'll say it, cool.  Alas, none of my games had support for this controller, so I was kind of stuck.

I'm calling this three stars mainly because the description line specifies PC but compatibility seems to be an issue with this controller and PC games...some older games didn't recognize the controller at all.  My suggestion is that if you're looking for a PC controller, this one probably won't be convenient for you and you'll be frustrated.",Not entirely PC compatible.,1441065600,3,,

I don't know why everyone is saying it's beautiful, though, because it's not.  The graphics are average for a game in 2015--not stunning or amazing.  Just average.  It's pretty much like playing Battlefield with Star Wars skins.  The single player content is indeed limited, which is disappointing; it would be nice to play a campaign mode with a story line, but you won't find that here.  The multiplayer modes are fun, but you better play 'em now while you can, before the servers become a ghost town.  Even now, some of the game modes are only 50% full.  Soon enough it will be pretty pointless to play and you'll be left with the underwhelming single player options.  If you fell for the hype, you'll be disappointed.

We also bought a Sabine figure - only to find out later that she has to be 'unlocked' in the game and couldn't be played by my husband immediately. Also, oddly enough, my husband couldn't benefits with Sabine as my daughter with Ahsoka when the two played together. It seemed odd and unlike other games of this type that they had played. If the whole point is to be able to take figures to friends houses and play together, that is a real kill joy for the 'visitor' to the system.

The game is quite fun, bright, colorful, and with a lot of different things to do. Naturally, being Disney, it is very kid friendly. My daughter really likes the different and creative skills as well as the overall story.  It really drew her in and she had a very fun time each time she played.

Although reasonably standard Assassins Creed fare, the setting in Victorian era England was very cool, the graphics were top notch, the gameplay was marginally improved from past efforts, and they added a couple new wrinkles into the mix that were great. Namely the Rope Grapple, which fairly well renders past Assassins Creed parkour somewhat a thjing of the past...and two main characters, the twins Evie and Jacob Frye. Both were compelling characters with their own strengths and weaknesses. You can choose to play as either except for the main story missions, which are tailored to one or the other. They have an equal amount of missions for each sequence though.

I also very much enjoyed the story. As the second part of the new story arc that basically began with Unity, I felt they made huge strides, especially over that last game. Where Black Flag (and most likely Rogue although I haven't played that) were sort of story bridges, and Unity was the inception of this new arc, Syndicate brought it forward nicely.

As always, once you finish the game, you can keep running around, wrapping up any loose ends and working on your trophies. With this once, fiishing the game actually unlocks some new quests that are unavailable before finishing the main story, so that was also a nice feature to include. Additionally, there is a not so secret area of the game map, that takes you to World War 1 London, where you play as an ancestor of Jacob Frye. That even increases the amount of gametime available to the base game.

This version, the Gold Edition, also features the season pass, which includes the Jack the Ripper DLC. I haven't yet played that, but several of my friends enjoyed it and I look forward to doing so soon.

Inexplicably, it does what so many other franchises are guilty of in their transition to Playstation 3. It tries to re-invet the wheel, creating bigger worlds,  and prettier graphics,  but screwing up the  very basic, bare essentials needed to make a game playable.

I'm talking about things like... saving your progress.

The previous hitman titles allowed you to save your progress just before trying something crazy... and if things went South, you could begin again right from where you were.  And you had a choice of where to save it. Hitman: Absolution has a series of ""checkpoints,"" that will save your current position. But the checkpoints are fixed and do not allow you to save progress at a time of your own choosing.  And if you turn the  game off, you will not re-spawn at that checkpoint when you turn it back on.

But worst of all, this game has a bug that wiped out all of my progress.

This is the second PS3 title with which I've had this problem.

It completely- COMPLETELY RUINS  the experience.

Game developers seem to be concentrating too much on making the games bigger and prettier for the PS3, but scrapping the elements needed for  basic functionality.

I've lost all of my progress and don't care to start over from the beginning.

WARM AND FUZZY ASSASSIN

Among game developers, there seems to be a weird tendency to add emotional, heart- tugging elements to franchises where it previously did not exist and quite frankly, doesn't fit.

Agent 47 shows affection for Diana and spends most of the game protecting Diana's daughter from harm. It doesn't add depth, it doesn't add to the story- it's just weird and seems to be part of some fad.

Have the emo kids all grown up and become game developers and taken total control of the gaming industry?

This was almost enough to make me not buy. However, youtubers posted great gameplay and I had to  add this to my collection. Im glad I did too, here is why:

1. Graphics look exactly like screenshots do. Very nice! Very clean!
2. Way faster and smoother than 2k15 for all movements. Strikes are way faster.
3. New barricade grapples make even a normal match down right brutal! You can even slam against the ring apron!
4. New irish whips causing opponents to fall violently to the floor, opposite of all other games where they just run endlessly.
5. New stamina exhaust animations. When you are tired you grapple slow and worn while breathing heavy!  Much like ea ufc.
6. New seated positions add to brutality. You can sit opponents up and kick them in the neck, back, or face! It adds awsome mixups!
7.better ring out angles! You can now see your wrestler from all sides! No more blackout camera angles out of the ring. We finally have camera cuts!
8. Breakouts back from wwe raw 2 and this time its better than ever! You can attack whenever you want to, and if its a falls count anywhere battle as long as you want!
9.champions recognition! During matches that aren't for the title, the announce team admires you by saying some pretty neat lines...despite a mostly bland commentary..this helps keep it fresh.
10. You can finally pin and submit in cage matches!!!
11.hell in a cell and steel cage structure drops down around superstars! It is just like real life as it lowers both guys stare down each other.
12. Hell in a cell revamped! You can now freely throw opponents into cell reg as regardless of possition! No more eye ranks!
13.create an arena! You can for the 1st time ever move the individual parts of your arena around! You can also add stage props like; strechers, cars, ladders, the statue of liberty..and a bit more.
14.no loading screens from the moment the entrance starts until you head back to the main menu! Just like ea ufc!
15.amazing soundtrack! The addition of updated superstar theme music adds a lot of depth in your experience! Like by alot!

Overall, this is the best wrestling game I have ever played! It bests out here comes the pain, raw 2, and most every other game! This is spectacular! If you listen to the bad reviews you will slap yourself to the floor and be robbing yourself of the greatest wrestling experience on any console!!!
I've been collecting wwe games for 13 years and nothing beats this by sheer realism! Seriously buy it, it will make any wrestling fan feel whole!!!

Real consumer rating 4.5/5 because of alternate attire glitch that renders characters invisible after the match. This is confirmed to be getting a fix as we speak by 2K..so when it does it will get an updated score then. Otherwise its perfect!

Over all the game is just boring and simplified to the point that you just need to hit the break button to drift in any car. Hopefully the following list helps you decide if you want to spend $60 on this game or not:

Graphics: It's very satisfying ! However, the game has a grayish filter that kinda bothered me when I was playing. The lights are very amplified in this game, and when you are going 170mph in highway, the lights constantly flicker in your face. The cinematic parts look pretty cool as well.

Gameplay: It is SUPER cheesy and simplified. Even NFS Rivals required more skill and had a better overall feeling to it. The controllers are very straight forward and there is no way to change them. There is no manual transmission. The game needs to be online all the time. But don't expect intense online races, simply because it doesn't exist. There is no lobby for racers to get into in order to choose a race or activity. It's a free roam game style with little to no player-player interaction.

Car handling and tuning: The customization and tuning looks very cool and reminds me of NFS carbon/underground. However, all cars handle the same PERIOD. All you need to do is to go with either drift or grip set up and the car will take care of everything else. I drove BMW, lambo, Ferrari, Nissan GTR  and all of them handle the same way. Just press the brake button and you are drifting in no time.
 Installing elite and high end parts on your Toyota Supra can  make it as good and even better than a lambo which is very cool and awesome.

Soundtrack / sounds: Soundtrack are very bad ! Thanks to Ps4 ability to play spotify in the background, I was glad to turn the music all the way down. But engine sounds are awesome and very real.

AI: The stupidest AI system ever. Cops are just jocks in this game. They are camping around the city just to follow you for 3 seconds and then lose you. Sometimes they smash to buildings and other cars and stop. They can't catch up with you if you are going over 120mph. I had to slow down and beg them not to lose me so I could finish my Outlaw missions. Other races are very aggressive and they just ram you in to walls and rear end you.

City and over all feeling: the city feels death and boring ! It is raining most of the time and the day/night cycle is just a jock. Sometimes the sky soddenly turn blue and you see a bright sun rising and after 5 minutes, it suddenly turns dark. It's like the earth flips into  a day light and then to night time. lol

Car selection: It's pretty good. You can see the list in their website, but over all I'm satisfied with the list. BUT, you can only have 5 cars in your garage. VERY STUPID !!! I ended up selling my Ferrari just to buy a lambo. So, you have to sell your cars to empty spots in your garage.

  Over all the game feels like NFS Most wanted( not the original, the 2012 version) + NFS rivals.
  I have hard time recommending this game to racing fans. Pick it up when it is $30.

I have had a chatpad for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One both of them being the official microsoft chatpads, and as expected they were great and offered all of what an on screen chatpad could give to you even with the function buttons.

Included in the package:
-Megadream Xbox One Chatpad
-2.4G Receiver
-User Manual

The way this is connected to your Xbox is not just by plugging it in like the Microsoft chatpad but in addition to plugging it in to your Xbox One Controller, you must connect the included the wireless receiver into one of the USB ports in your Xbox, then you click the wifi button on the bottom of the chatpad and you are connected. It works quick and is easy to use but you do have to add that extra step, but only once.

It uses the controllers power so you do not need to add batteries which is nice but it will slowly take some battery over time from your controller. The keyboard layout is like a basic computer keyboard and does not give you the symbols and extra letters that the on screen keyboard will give you besides the regular symbols such as ?,!,@, and more.

Overall, for the price, this is definitely a cheaper option to the Xbox option and if you are just looking for a cheap option that mounts easily to your controller so that you can send faster messages to your friends or to type in codes then this is a great choice that I can recommend. You can still listen to your in line audio cable by flipping up the one connected to the chatpad and then plugging your audio cable into the 3.5mm audio jack.

The virtual surround sound delivers in both primary and ambient gaming sounds.  The remote is battery powered via non-removable rechargeable battery.  A micro-USB charging cable is included.  The amp has a toggle switch to choose between preset console and PC/mobile sound profiles.  The headset sounds very good on gaming consoles and PCs during gaming.  Use of the amp is optional but it noticeably enhances the sound.  Its not just a gimmick and I cant see using the headset without it.

The headset is comfortable despite slightly firm foam cups. I don't feel the inner panels making contact with the ear which is good. There is no excessive pressure nor discomfort during long periods of use.  A four-hour Little Big Planet session confirmed this fact. They also easily adjust to fit heads of all sizes.  The flexible boom mic can easily adjust to any position and sounds pretty good.  The very flexible mic design allows the most adjustment options for positioning the mic just right. Mic sensitivity and overall voice quality are both very good as well.

Although the headset works well for gaming, I found them a bit lacking for listening to music on my PC and my iPod.  These are engineered primarily for gaming and it shows.  During music playback, highs are semi-flat at best and bass is non-existent and the sound sometimes suffers distorttion or briefly drops out altogether for a split second on lower frequency sounds when using the amp.  Without the amp, music is just too flat and dull sounding compared to other headsets or even a set of earbuds.

The game had shown true evolution in that when Demon Souls came out it felt SO difficult (and mostly because for Demon souls and DS1 and DS2 I didn't really utilize online coop as much as I wanted to first beat the game alone). However, once you get used to the game, its CHALLENGING, but not IMPOSSIBLE.  DS1 was an amazing upgrade from Demon Souls and DS2 I found wasn't as great as DS1, until I bought the PS4 version with all the updates (they made the PS4 version MUCH more easier than then PS3 version, but was still pretty challenging). In my opinion, bloodborne was a good game but nothing compared to the other soul series (it was a slight let down for me, although I still enjoyed playing)

Now, moving on to DS3.  I can say this much... How the heck can a person that didn't play last Soul Series even get to the first boss after the tutorial??? I think they made the mob enemies so much stronger and smarter.  I must say I am not like a super expert, but I also think I am pretty good with the soul series as I stated earlier I've managed to beat every soul series without coop.  But DS3... man.... it took a lot of getting used too, but still some of the bosses are so fast and strong I feel like I couldn't beat it without coop.  I think they did a GREAT job bringing back some of DS1 environment (not just characters but the stages too) and the feeling too.  If you loved DS1, you will definitely love DS3.  If you never played souls series... you will have a very steep learning curve... The only frustration I had is that I feel like there are too many online players that aren't that good, so even if they summon me they die quickly, and on the other hand, when I need some help, people I summon dies so quickly they don't really help that much. But then again, I guess this is part of soul series.

I beat the game and it was a lot of fun, I loved seeing all the old levels remade and enjoyed the heck out of the always awesome Ratchet gameplay, but this game had no soul, its a hollow chocolate bunny rabbit. Its great and all, yet you wish that the Easter bunny was filled with some cream or was solid chocolate. For the casual people, the hollow rabbit is good enough and yes, there's nothing wrong with it, but for people that love that chocolate rabbit, they'd rather the rabbit never to have been made.

First off, I want to say that if you are just looking for a very fun, smooth, beautiful looking action platformer game and don't care so much about story or pacing or making sense, then you need to get this game right away.
Let's start with my history with ratchet. I played the PS2 games as a kid and fell in love with them, Going Commando is my 2nd favorite game of all time. Then the future series came out and it was as amazing if not better than the originals AND it even continued the story line and was in the same exact universe as the ps2 games. We had Rachet size matters, which I did preorder and play back then on psp, but that was more of a side game, YET felt like a Rachet game and wasn't too bad.
Insomniac also made some crappy ratchet games like all4one and full frontal assault which really sucks, BUT then they finished off the future series with Into The Nexus and that game was just as good as any other ratchet game.
I personally feel they should have stopped here as the story was done and they didn't exactly have to make any more.
THEN I hear there is going to be a movie and a reboot and was instantly disgusted by the thought. I was right to be so. I did preorder because ratchet is my favorite franchise of games of all time, but wasn't expecting a lot.

MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS REBOOT:
First off, the story and pacing is really bad/annoying. You can clearly see that they left out a lot of info that's instead showed in the movie so that little kiddies that go see the movie, then ask their mom to play the game and the story will already be known to them.
In the original game, the villain Drek(terrible voice in the reboot by the way) ""says"" his plan is to make a new planet since his species can't live on their planet anymore and to do this he is going to rip pieces off of other planets to make a new one. In this game, you just watch a video of him saying his dad's business or something is planet building and nothing more, THEN later in the game he talks about how they need a new planet for his species and he never even mentioned that before. THIS game does a lot of that, it also goes by very quick in dialogue and character. Ratchet and clank meet and almost instantly just go on an adventure like they were always buddies, clank doesn't care as much about finding Quark like he did in the original game and is just like ""yeah let's go hoverboarding"" when he would NEVER say that when there's and important mission to do. You almost don't even know what you are fighting for and I don't even care for these characters. The pacing is wrong when just talking to people.
Another thing, there is way to much repeating dialogue from quarks narrating and the weapons dealer. Quark will constantly be like "" ratchet can't breath underwater"" when you are swimming and "" ratchet knew he needed to jump on this platform and he says that like 20 times during a mission. The weapons dealer is beyond annoying, he will literally harass you to buy his weapons like every 30 seconds even when you are no where near a weapons vender it's terrible.

In the end, it's a very fun and beautiful game but it HAS NO SOUL whatsoever, I've actually paused the game so many times during play to exhale and say there is no soul here. It's a ratchet and clank game alright, but ITS JUST A TIE IN MOVIE GAME IN THE END FOR MONEY WITH NO SOUL.

3,True,"10 9, 2015",AFVCE4MQF110C,B00ZGRLJJS,Paulie Wilkerzin,"My thoughts on Transformers Devastation

First, the good (It's PlatinumGames. Of course, there's good.):
-The gameplay is solid. It's as high speed, over the top and insane as I've come to expect from Platinum.
-The music is excellent and fits the metal on metal action perfectly.
-The multiple characters, unlockable difficulties and challenge mode do offer replayability (which is nice, given the campaign takes like 6 hours.)
-I like the cell shaded art style.
-The voice acting is solid.

Now, the bad:
-I have and will continue to defend The Legend of Korra game. You'd be hard pressed to find a game in the same price range that has better quality. That being said, Transformers Devastation is not being sold as a budget title and I can't defend it's 50 dollar price tag.
-It is short, even by hack-n-slash standards
-Lacks memorable boss battles which is something I always look forward to from Platinum.
-The first 2/3rds of the game you will spend most of your time running around in the exact same location.
-They are several spots where enemies can attack and deal heavy damage from off screen. Flying enemies being the worst offenders.
-The 5 playable characters are redundant (especially given the short length). Optimus Prime is clearly better than the other four. Some attempt at balance would have been nice.
-I'm also not a fan of the weapon upgrade system but I'm not a fan of crafting systems in general. They bore me and feel very out of place in a game about all out action.

A personal gripe:
-The gameplay is very similar to Bayonetta (it even has witch time) with just enough tweaks to make it annoying. The default controls move the dodge button (luckily that can be changed) and instead of double tapping the button to transform (like Bayonetta's panther), you have to hold the button which is the same button you use to dodge. Meaning, you will often find yourself transforming when you just wanted to dodge because you held the button a split second to long. Once you adapt to it, i's not a major issue but the option to switch the control to ""double tap to transform"" would have been nice. Of course, that's just my personal preference and if you haven't played Bayonetta this won't be an issue for you (Also, go play Bayonetta.)

Indifferent: The story. I don't care about Transformers. I bought this because Platinum are the best makers of action games around. I didn't find the story interesting but Transformers fans might.

In conclusion:
If this had been released for 30 bucks or less, I'd recommend it. Unless you wanna play through the campaign several times, get all the trophies or enjoy challenge maps, you won't get 50 bucks out of this. After the reaction people had to The Legend of Korra (which was 15 dollars on release), how Activision thought charging 50 for this, obviously, budget title was a good idea confuses me. But, of course, it is Activision.
My love for PlatinumGames is as large as ever but, in the future, I will be wary of PlatinumGames that also have Activision attached to them.

5,True,"04 9, 2018",ALJNU3QDHKJZ,B00ZJBSCJQ,Tomi,"I grew up on South Park. I was probably too young to watch it when I started in elementary school hind-sight, but I watched it pretty steadily for seasons, throughout high school. Several seasons ago, the appeal seemed to fade, and I pretty much stopped watching.

I played the first game when a kid at the school where I teach recommended it, and I was hesitant to start, but my sister liked it, too, so I decided to give it a try. I played it, liked it, and still didn't watch any new episodes of South Park. When this game came out, I really wasn't sure if I would like it because I wasn't sure if there would be three more years of jokes I wouldnt get (because the first game had pretty classic South Park references), but I decided to pre-order it anyway. Im really glad I did.

The Stick of Truth was pretty cool, but The Fractured But Whole is even better. I don't know if thats because I like super heroes more than I like high-fantasy, but despite not knowing some of the newer characters (like PC Principal), there was still a lot of classic South Park, too. I liked the game customization throughout, by meeting with Mr. Mackey, and I liked that throughout the game, your backstory evolved as you gain powers and abilities. There are some other small things in the game that was really hilarious to me, too. For example, sometimes when fighting in the road, the kids call out car and they have to move to the sidewalk for a car to pass. Even though the game isn't open world in the same way that other games are, there are side quests available, and collectibles that can only be found as the game continues and abilities and friends are unlocked.

The Fractured But Whole was really nostalgic for me. Even though the show has evolved and changed, and I no longer watch it, even playing it, I remembered talking on the playground with my friends in elementary school (not any older than the kids in South Park actually are), talking about the latest episode. Im not sure if I really loved this South Park game because of that or despite that. Not everyone would be into this game. Im not sure if a person could go in without ever watching an episode and play the game and appreciate, but I also don't think anyone would need to be a die-hard South Park fan to get real enjoyment out of the game.",Better than the First,1523232000,,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 4'}",

The Standard Xbox One Controller is good, but the joysticks have a hard center detent and the triggers are a bit cheap feeling, over all it is ok for casual gaming. My XB1 controller required multiple presses to activate and a few little annoyances. I came to the 'Zon to find something, and what a great thing it was.
  The triggers are light and easy to depress, the bumpers are equally easy to activate and solid feeling. The joysticks have a centering detent, but it doesn't require effort to keep it from 'the edge' of that detent. As an avid Forza Motorsports fan, I found the standard controller with these new 5/6 games was hard to do precise turns, since it required effort to get that joystick right of center, fighting the resistance. My previous top lap in my 944 on my fav track was 2.08xx and I tried for a week to best it.. Once I was comfortable with it, it hit the track. The first race I shaved 2 seconds off my time!
  There is something about the feedback that the controller provides that does enhance the experience and the ability to push the limit. I am a lil old school in my belief that unless your IN the car, feeling your bits giggle, it's no good, but this is just as good. I might even put off buying that 200+ wheel I've been wanting.

5,True,"11 16, 2016",A1267U3ZSQGOTP,B00ZO1SUSE,Joseph Martin,"If you are looking for proof that good JRPGs exist for the 3DS, then look no further than Stella Glow. A turn-based strategy game based within a world of fantasy, featuring a harem of female companions to interact with and ""romance."" Recommended to me by the man once known as DarkFire, who now goes by the name Raltrios, this is probably the most underrated 3DS game of 2015. Beautiful art, good voice acting, a fabulous soundtrack, and a compelling story. Stella Glow is the kind of game anyone who enjoyed Record of Agarest War or fantasy anime should try, with just one minor caveat I found after finishing the game twice.

As in many JRPGs you begin the game in a small village, full of friendly people who live out their lives in peaceful harmony. The main character, a young man by the name of Alto, lives together with his childhood friend Lisette and her milf of a mother Rosa. Disaster strikes as a witch named Hilda sings the 'Song of Destruction', crystallizing the village and everyone in it besides Alto and Lisette. After fighting some monsters and one of Hilda's lackeys the Regnant Knights show up, scaring off Hilda and saving Alto and Lisette. You come to find out that Lisette is actually a witch herself, and Alto is a special person capable of tuning witches. So the two of you join the knights in their search for the other witches, and a way of reversing the damage the song of destruction has caused.

Gameplay is broken down into two parts, the battles and the ""free time."" In battle you begin by selecting the units you wish to use in the fight, placing them in designated starting positions. Once underway you move the characters across the battlefield, attempting to place them in opportune positions to strike at the enemy with melee, ranged, and magical attacks. Part way into the game you unlock the ability to 'tune' the witches in your party, an ability that can turn the tide of battle by restoring health, damaging enemies, and even freezing time. It's a powerful move, requiring you to build up a meter in battle by defeating enemies.

Free time, the other side of the coin, is exactly what it sounds like. You are given a limited number of chances to do things while within the castle ground, such as building up your trust with characters by hanging out with them, searching around for random loot, performing odd jobs for the store owners, and tuning your witch companions. Unlike in battle, tuning here can only occur when you reach a roadblock in your relationship with a specific witch. So you take them to the 'turning chamber' where you shove your dagger into them, entering their heart and battling their inner demons. Yeah, it's pretty sexually suggestive, especially when you see what they wear while within the chamber.

The story is full of twists and turns, some you'll see coming and others that will catch you off guard. The best part is that depending on how well you do and some of the dialogue choices you make, you will get one of two main endings and one of several character endings. Now I got the normal ending first and discovered something that not even my friend had seen, something that excited both of us as it tied into a character we both liked and hinted at something more. However with the character endings, Alto ends up sticking with one of the characters from the game of your choosing so long as you built up enough trust with them. This includes not only the witches, but also your normal human companions both male and female. These endings, some at least, make this game feel like it will be the only one. Which is that minor caveat I spoke of.

Sadly my favorite character in the game, who you can do odd jobs for, was not among the list of characters to pick from to end with. This being Medea, the royal musician and caretaker of the tuning chamber. She's very flirty and has a, hmmm, let's say intriguing character design. She helps Alto by steering him in the right direction when he is looking for answers, and in turn she enjoys the songs the witches sing when Alto tunes them. Basically she likes to watch, well, listen at least. See she's blindfolded and in her odd jobs route she will reveal why, as well as possibly implying that she wouldn't mind a little ""tuning time"" with Alto herself. If you catch my drift.

UPDATE.  I'm increasing it by one star, simply because I play it every day, so it can't be THAT bad.  The duration of it in which I play is very short however.  A couple more gripes...your character can walk only a short distance, just by the shops around the small town.  You can't wander into the great outdoors to visit anyone, you can only be magically transported to a certain person's house.  Also, when you pinpoint the building site of each character on a map, you are transported their immediately as well.  You also don't have your own house, which seems like kinda a big oversight, that or they didn't think people would be interested in having their own houses for some reason.  So, every day, you go to play and the game begins with your character already inside the shop (or is it right outside?).  Very very limited freedom in this game.  Also, I bought a big set of Amiibo cards.  The first card was cool, I got to build an aquarium.

4,True,"07 5, 2016",A1RLVW4KZPSCPN,B00ZTRW00C,Joshua,"I wanted to give this product at least a month till I gave an honest review. See this little device was a new world to me, and I used to mainly play for Overwatch to keep my hand from feelings cramped. I also have a writers desk which doesn't help with the issue of space.

In any case, the choice I had to pick was the Razer Tartarus or the Orbweaver. Quite honestly, if you got smaller hands, the Tartarus is a better overall choice. Course that is my honest opinion and it costs $50 less.

Having a miniature keypad that mimics the WADS of your left hand and being moveable is actually super comfortable. Firstly, you have to find what suits for your hand to rest and which angle. You have the freedom of moving it around so if you want a farther reach you can! The unit has a small clicking ""space bar"" button that sticks out about half an inch your thumb naturally sits on top of. Your thumb also has access to the circle pad that hosts up, down, left, right. You can program to have it do whatever you want which we'll get to in a moment. Lastly for your thumb is one more button that mainly is an Alt key, but again can be changed.

Your palm rests on the curved Razor logo rest, with a button to move it back if you choose so. Your fingers lay on the 03, 07, 08, and 09 keys. Which, you guessed it, are the WADS. around them are the rest of the numbers till 15. Few shortcuts are programmed such for Overwatch which 11 is Shift, 04 is E and 02 is Q. So it really is nicely set up and feels great. buttons are soft style stealth so you won't sound like a galloping horse such as mechanical keyboards sound.

The Tartarus is plugged into your PC with the Razor style golden USB and is attached with the nylon cloth like cord Razer puts with their products. Which I actually like.

They may be that brand that everyone assumes is overpriced and make cheap products, but I wouldn't deny of telling anyone the Tartarus is actually a simple little piece of tech that works great. You can't type on it, but if your in a party talking then you don't have to worry about that.

The only thing I have negative is the software can a bit of a pain to move around in and the special ""apps"" section isn't really meant for the Tartarus but instead for the Orbweaver. This is due to the Orbweaver allowing more color configuration such as Overwatch making it Yellow and Which logo. My app section actually crashes me Synapse, so I have to avoid that when making changes.

All in all, love the product. If it's cheap get it. I currently own the Chroma version as it was on sale for $50. If you can't get that one, get the regular.

To be a hundred percent honest, the major factor in me wanting a PS4 was to play 'Infamous: Second Son'. And let me tell you, it was totally worth it! The game is a blast! If you liked the other two, and you'll like this one too, but that, my friends, is for a separate review.
First, I will say that I didn't buy thispackage from Amazon. I bought it from a certain specialty store that was running a trade in deal towards the purchase of a PS4. It was either this or the 'Last of Us' bundle, and since I had already played through it on the PS3, I chose this one.
'Destiny' the game itself is what it is. If you're like me and putzed around with it upon first release, there isn't a whole lot more to it. It's mostly cosmetic changes.
The console itself, as far as the paint job, is okay. I'm not sure what all the high praise is about. It seems like a cheap silk screen job on a regular arctic white shell. I personally prefer the original black. I really wish I had gotten myself one of those nice MGS models, but whatever.
The updates are nice. The new model runs much more quietly. The physical buttons on the front are nice. The new hard-drive try is nice too. A bit easier to swap out than before. I put in a 2TB drive before I even powered it on for the first time after realizing from owning the Xbone how paltry 500GB is for the current gaming generation. Most games install something like 15-30GB of data on your drive. Wait till something like a new Elder Scrolls game comes out and they really figure out how to harness the power of these systems. A word of warning though: If you are one of the people who are waiting for the 1TB version to be released, you are much better off getting a 500GB system and slapping your own drive in. From what I understand, the terabyte version will be about $100 more. Even if it's only $50 more, you're better off buying a 2TB drive from good 'ol Amazon for $80-90 and slapping it in. Then you have a 500GB drive to do what you will with and double the memory in your system.
AAnyway, I'm not going to get into the whole debate over which system is better. You can't convince a fanboy of either side that the competition is better. For me, the major catalyst to me buying the Xbone first is the exclusives. The Xbone's just appealed to ME more. That's not true for everyone, I know, but it was for me. I did need 'Infamous: Second Son' though. :-D
Well, I hope this rant helped you out in some way. It's a good system, a mediocre game and a cool paint job for a younger gamer. The updates to the console itself do warrant a purchase over the standard system.",My Opinion...,1442793600,,,

You start with nothing and slowly take over territories in order to get revenge on a mob boss in very typical Mafia fashion. Each territory has a unique story but follows the same kind of set up - You meet the main character of the area, You help him/her take it over and move onto the next. It may seem a bit dull but it's not. Each territory has its own unique story and that is the beauty of the game. The developer keeps the high-quality story going from start to finish.

The gameplay is simple yet fun, Similar to previous instalments. I feel the numerous collectables are very needless and don't other anything other than wasted time. The environments are unique and fitting to the time period (the late 60's). The driving controls could have been a bit more satisfying, It's nowhere near as enjoyable as it was in Mafia 2.

Saints Row worked for the simple fact it didn't take itself seriously and was about fun. So it had a certain charm about it and felt completely different than the Grand Theft Auto series. Mafia 3 I really wanted to love but in the end it feels like Wal-Mart brand Grand Theft Auto because it takes itself too seriously and the execution of the graphics, gameplay and mission don't match. Not to mention the bugs. Consoles have issues sure, but on PC the game crashes wildly and is unplayable at times.

The story itself is good if you can make it past the forgettable and boring gameplay. Not to mention the bugs and crashes depending on which version you own. This game had a great idea behind it, and if it had been crafted by another studio perhaps something really special here but it is a swing and a miss for Take 2 Interactive.

Imagine going to George R.R. Martin and him saying, ""I want a fan fiction author to finish my series, who can't afford professional editing."" That is the experience we get with Mafia III, a great concept for a story trapped behind a lack of professionalism, and execution. I thought about giving this game 3 stars on console but for PC the game doesn't even run. A future fix doesn't change the fact people who paid for the game got one that didn't even work at times.

Pros
- Story if you can make it through the host of technical issues (on PC you pretty much can't)
- Soundtrack

Cons
- Graphics
- Performance
- Bugs
- Boring mission system
- Bad execution
- wasted potential.

Grade: F for PC

Mafia 3 had potential to be a sleeper hit of the year, but Take 2 Interactive forgot to handle the technical elements and implement interesting gameplay and missions.

So the new TR Mixamp is great in that it doesn't need a chat cable (voice goes over USB and sounds much clearer than the old Mixamps).

Using the Yo-Kai Watch, Nate must travel around town locating Yo-Kai, battling them, and befriending them to use on his team.

Nate can issue items, execute special moves, and even revive Yo-Kai in battle. In addition, Nate can configure six of his Yo-kai on his watch to create special team-up bonuses and can adjust on the dial as necessary in battle.

It plays as a 3rd party fighting/action RPG game, in the same way, although visually it might appear and feel more like Darksiders. But it has many more close similarities to the Souls series, in that it is pretty difficult.

The plot sees you as some kind of reformed criminal in a fantasy/gothic/mythical world of monsters and magic, as you try and solve a mystery/defeat the evil powers, etc. Play sees you choose weapons and armour, as you hack and blast your way through enemies and levels, until you red each boss.

Sadly in comparison to Dark Souls the game falls short. Gameplay, especially movement and combat feel lumpy and slow. The targetting mechanic is unreliable and the hits you land often seem out of time with your expectations - which is important when the combat is challenging because you need to be able to trust your timing! The look of the game is also a bit lacking. Character models are ok, but the scenery and locations look muddy and lacking in detail. A lot of doors and passages are very hard to find, and not in a good way. The boss fights are fairly routine - most of them can be won by good use of the long range weapon which you are given as standard, and which can get you past most enemies if you have patience, which is required as they have long health bars!

In short, the game seems quite short and there are hardly any additional or optional areas or quests. It lacks the wow factor needed to keep you interested.",A vague success,1468800000,,{'Format:': ' Video Game'},

Not only is the product imported from Japan, but the product itself looks and feels aesthetically pleasing. Right out of the box, the product can be easily identified as a Oficial Sony/PlayStation product. What makes this charging station different from others out there is its way of charging the controllers. The charging station does not connect to your PS4 at all, it uses its own power supply to power the station. Not only does this feature provide cable management, but it indeed charges your controllers a lot faster because of its power coming from a wall outlet. The charging station comes with the proper cables and a manual that was only in Japanese which was quite an amusing experience because this has been my first imported product. In addition, knowing that the box and content inside the package was in Japanese, made me understand that the product was original and coming straight from Sony's factory in Japan, its country of origin.

When the controllers are charging, you will see that on the controllers, their light bar flashes in peach color. Once the controllers are fully charged, the light disappears and the controllers are no longer charging which is a nice feature because the controllers are no longer being over powered.

I would recommend this product to all PS4 gamers.

You must complete her doing or she will destroy you. Anyways, the game has its good and bad.

""Game design is most definitely an art, and the artist is the one in control of their own hand.

One of Blizzard's oldest philosophies has been to build worlds and games that we ourselves love, and, only then, inviting players to join us on adventures within. This doesn't mean we don't care or listen, it just means that we do disagree at a philosophical level about some things that players may not like.

Everyone who has worked on Legion has put tons of love and sweat into building this expansion. We are most definitely working on making Legion the best expansion WoW has seen - and I think that will show over the coming months.""

So in other words, Blizzard thinks they are novelists and film directors. I write Science Fiction and fantasy myself. I have sold only 3500 books worldwide but that is impressive for me as a indie author. I never expected to sell one. The reality is I do not listen to what people say outside my editor and go off my inspires me. But don't kid yourself Blizzard this isn't the same thing and I love my fans.

I am not producing a game that will cost them, hundreds or thousands of dollars of years. They are not playing a product. They are experiencing a Journey I have in my head and are along for the ride. I am honored they happen to like it and respect the people who don't. I think it is cute you people at Blizzard feel your product is too good to listen to your customers and compare it to other forms of art. That you are making a game you want to play, and are kind enough to step down from your amazing talent to let us pathetic mortals in.

This is a joke and tell that to Bioware after the ending of Mass Effect 3. I will no longer support this company - I don't care how many of my friends still play. There are too many other games to play - it is that simple. And kinder developers. Please think twice about buying Legion.

I originally wrote a glowing review and I meant every word. I largely still feel that way but the bad things that came up as I progressed forced me to change my review. So while the positives I experienced were real, the bad tainted the whole experience down just a bit. The good is, the story for Legion is great, class halls and lore is a step in the right direction. Artifacts are amazing, the zones are great for the most part (not sure about Suramar) and the Demon Hunter class is fun.

Now here is where is gets bad. The balancing in the game is the worst I have seen ever. At the time of this writing 10/25/16 you have Fire Mages doing more dps than anyone else by a wide margin and Affliction Warlocks doing 40% less DPS in the very best gear. There are many classes horrible like this - and the new game direction Watcher - boldly stated they can't change things because the people who grinded their Fire Mage artifact will feel like they made the wrong choice.

But you see they already did that to Outlaw Rogues. Which leads to the next point - Artifact grind is horrible on more than one character and I am not joking for alts it is horrible. Not to mention you have to grind Suramar again and even if you love it (I don't) it is a real chore. Professions are gated behind questing, a rare NPCs (some professions) that I rarely every see. Also who knows with Blizzard, you could spend all this time grinding out a class that is good and you are useless for end game with some changes.

Artifact power makes this horrible. Where as before get some gear and you are good to go. Class halls are amazing, but after you are all done with the story they are really Garrison Jr. Not much fun at all. World Quests remain interesting only until you get alright gear, then they are nothing but artifact grind with a chance of a legendary.

Legendaries (there are several for all classes and ones any class can use) you get from various ways, and they are hard to get and really boost your stats. No it isn't like the cape or ring. It is all RNG, and there was a glitch where people got two of them right away. I have been grinding far too many hours to see none. That is the nature of RNG and not everyone is a fan.

The raids are great, and the Mythic Dungeons along with the plus system. But if your class isn't one of the chosen ones, you will never see much content above normal. While you could argue the game has always been like this give or take. With the artifact grind and the fact Class Halls are time gated that you will have to do to unlock your last slot? It makes re rolling something else a borderline troll.

The Honeymoon phase with Legion ended quickly after class balance, PVP, and Artifact power flaws were exposed. This isn't a great expansion, this isn't a good expansion. This is an average expansion with echoes of interesting elements and very strong lore. My personal stance is Wrath> MoP> BC> Vanilla> Cata> Legion>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Warlords of Draenor.

Pros
- Story
- Lore surrounding classes
- Artifacts
- Graphics
- Raids
- Dungeons
- Music
- Demon Hunters

Cons
- The way the handled professions
- Blood Vendor added destroys gathering professions
- Legendary system too much RNG
- Class Balance is the worst it has ever been.
- PVP is the worst gearing it has ever been
- Artifact grind is insane, and if you need to reroll to a new class or spec even worse

Conclusion
World of Warcraft Legion at first feels like Blizzard's best work. But it slowly devolves into major flaws that plague the experience the worst being class balance. Now while it is leagues better than Warlords of Draenor - anything is. Legion demands most of your time to grind up your artifact right, after hitting 110. This isn't a friendly expansion to players who have a handful of hours a week or want alts.
The question is, Time wise is this expansion worth it? For me that is an easy No. Though I enjoyed the leveling, class story, and lore.

5,True,"02 10, 2012",A3P3U42S4A2YHQ,B017TFOZOA,C.E.,"I play games for a variety of reasons.  I play them to relax, to get lost in a world, to hear/play a good story, and I play them as a way to escape.  This game fits the bill on all of those accounts perfectly.  As a mature (read: over 30 years old) gamer, I have a different set of expectations that have grown and changes as I have gotten older.

This game first appeared on my radar as word of R.A. Salvatore being involved trickled out onto the web.  I have played another game he was involved in, ""Demon Stone"" for the PS2.  As with that iteration, this one is well written- the story takes the cake.  Intrigue, plot twists, friends, foes, allies, and antagonists all take center stage in a tale that is fun and engaging here.  The main quest is a good yarn in and of itself, but veering off the well beaten path takes you to other villages, characters, problems, and areas that you would just as easily miss if you don't look around.  Superb writing, plotting, and setting.  The story might seem kind of contrived and a mash up of genre staples...but Salvatore weaves it all together into something wonderful.  I would have to say this game is like ""playing"" a very ambitious fantasy novel.

The combat is easy to master, but still presents a challenge as enemies scale to your level, the fighting can get intense, and there are several moves and tactics that unlock as you level up that make all the zipping around the screen fun and satisfying.  The weapon and spell effts are nice, realized well, and graphically pleasing.  Intense colors, good sound design, and a freedom of movement lends itself to combat that doesn't feel stale and challenges you to mix it up and see what happens.  McFarlane's talent really shines through in the creature design and world art.  From things that are creepy to silly- there a quite a few vistas, creatures, plants, and areas to look at.  It is very pretty, vibrant, and busy.  Other areas are appropriately dark, somber, and decayed.  All in all- the game looks as good as it plays, and in may ways, the setting of Amalur is a character in and of itself.

Collectors of in-game stuff rejoice!  As this game is packed with all you would come to expect from Rolston- the mad genius behind some ""Elder Scrolls"" games.  There are scraps of paper, books, lore stones, items, journals, lockpicks, chests, loot, and tomes to collect, read, and discover.  The info is doled out well and comes at a pace that encourages exploration.  There are several times (as I am not done with the game yet) where I have been distracted with a side quest just because I want to know more about what is happening in the world around me.  It lends itself to a very fleshed out feeling, a world fully developed, alive, and teeming with secrets to discover.  Again, this game is superb in its presentation on all of those accounts.

Getting down to the technical details, there are systems that feel familiar, yet lend their own flair to the game.  Crafting, weapon/equipment repair, and reagent gathering are all things that have been done before.  They are integrated well with this game and the feeling of familiarity is helpful at keeps the learning curve from getting too steep.  There is not a physical manual included with the game...it is added to the disc.  I don't find that I miss it, as info in pretty easy to come by and the interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate.  Taking the best parts of past games, throwing in new ones, and whipping up a recipe for something new is a welcome addition to both the genre and the world of video games in general.  I haven't experienced a single glitch, hitch, or mess-up with the game on my system.  Load times are forgiveable and don't take forever- but then again, with the amount of content and data I don't expect instant load times.  The world is vast, expansive, and feels that way as well.  With that, fast travel isn't a ""must have"" but is something that I use quite often, just to traverse the distances that soon become very apparent.

Others might say this game is too similar to ""Fable"" or some other megalithic MMO out there.  While I see some of the similarities, I also see that 38 studios has crafted an entirely different, yet familiar feeling, monster.  They have poured passion, heart, blood, sweat, and tears into this game- and it shows.  Its massive, teeming with things to discover, and presented in a beautiful package.  Combat, crafting, exploration, leveling, and play styles are all as fluid as you would want- they (the devs) have really tried to make an expansive and all-inclusive game- and they have come as close to perfection as is possible at this point in my opinion.

So- buy this game if you are looking for some amazing value for your dollars.  Buy it if you want to see where I predict the next generations of RPG's will be going.  Buy it if you want an awesome story, amazing playability, and some great art.  Buy it if you are looking to really get into a game and not be finished in 10 hours.  This is hands down- one of the BEST games I have every played.  Simply amazing- worth every penny spent and then some.",A day of RECKONING indeed!,1328832000,78,"{'Edition:': ' Standard', 'Platform:': ' PlayStation 3'}",

Disclaimer: I got my copy of the day one edition at a local store,  I've been ordering day one purchases on smaller items and Usps in my area is just laying down on me.

It's up to you as a potential buyer whether these things I list are good or bad. All of these situations I have experienced personally in game.

*The game should have had the sub-heading ""The game that miyazaki designed to purposefully kill you, an action RPG by design that just happens to have a side of adventure and cool armors and weapons"" That' satire.. but satire with pure truth.

*Enemy NPC don't play to the same ""World rules"" as you do as a player. You vs. CrestFallenwarrior (Not early, but in the spot where you can fight him) It's like the DLC artorias fight all over again, except worse.

*The Armor still really doesn't do anything like it should... you will never have armor that makes you feel like a legit knight, even full Havel. Like the above bullet point, CF just cut me down multiple times.. *Shrug*

*Not all enemies are not linked to the player aggroing them, but are linked to other enemies. For instance, I was fighting a large enemy, trying to get back to 200,000+ souls I had dropped. Well, I made a point to clear out ALL surrounding enemies, take my time and pull this one enemy to terrain in my favor. I'm a veteran of the souls series, AND of the level. (at least in regards to where enemy placement is.) SO things are rough, but going well. The enemy like a lot of douche bag enemies in the game, has that magic pixel where they survive and are moving around like their in full health. That's totally legit after all?????? ""Git gud"" right? *Says in a very bitterly salty manner* So this enemy that ran all the way from god knows where, just runs up out of the blue and shanks me, I die, losing my ""valuable time"". Now this might be funny to you, but when your playing the game and the same situation happens to you... well as your crying your bitter tears of honest to god wasted time... well maybe you'll empathize a bit?

*You cannot repair your broke rings of sacrifice like in DarkSouls2, unfortunately. Their is a repair function in the game, but so far its been totally pointless... maybe future dlc?

*Their is no ""rusted ring"" the item that let you traverse through water at a quick pace. Their is more water in this game though, and some very tough enemies in said water..and it would be a nice item to have to level the playing field.

*Gravity is still the worst enemy of all, like all souls games. Again, unfortunately.

*Enemies in the game, work in tandem, to push you as a player.. by push, I mean beat the crap out of you and kill you. From a game design perspective the enemies are not by themselves ""hard"" but the game really is set up in such a way, that as the player you will constantly get stabbed in the back by it and killed. Surviving in the game literally requires you to ""Break the pattern"" in a way.. with enemies and their placement. Although it won't be possible.

*There is a bridge in the game, it looks suspicious... over a large body of water, look behind you often, silence fills the air, be prepared to roll... or be prepared to literally be eaten. This is the ONLY warning you will get. You won't get any audio or visual cues in game.

*Like ALL the other souls games,  FromSoftware basically did not fully animate the enemies movements. They don't have full frames of motion, so for instance, they won't slowly turn around to face you.. they will just *Whip* around.. or slide around.. etc.. Enemies look good, aesthetically though. And the same crap will happen with the bosses as well, not all of them, but the majority.

*Enemies can kill you through walls,  through thick CONCRETE stair cases...  other players with their shields up... etc...your safe no where in the game. SO basically the collision mechanics as far as the enemies are concerned.. don't exist. Now if you try to do the same thing to the enemies, oh, suddenly the collision mechanics start working better, but not in you favor.

*A lot of the bosses, don't require skills to beat, but are gimmick fights. Another words. poke poke poke.. dodge, follow a certain pattern..Its about 10% prepared and 90% pattern following,  but even then the deck will quite literally be stacked against you as the player. Not by a few cards, but but a whole deck and it will never shrink. For instance, I've had enemies not follow their attack patterns, they suddenly mid fight change it up.. and it seems random so...I don't know what's going on programming wise in the game, but I assume its purposeful. Even though the game is supposed ""Learn from your mistakes and get better""

*The game, aesthetically (appearance wise) is a lot better than the other souls games. Obviously FromSoftware used a ton of assets from bloodborne in this game. That could not be any more obvious, unless you did not play bloodborne. It's not a bad thing per-say.

*Weapon arts - They're useful sometimes, but its no comparison to Bloodborne and their ""Weapon skills"" well unless you go with the fact that bloodborne had some weapon skills that were also lame. But in DarkSouls3, your ability to use the weapon skills when you really need them, your character just has too much a wind up time compared to the enemies, so your literally always at a dis-advantage combat wise, close quarters. (at least using your weapon of choice)

*The leveling system is garbage from a design perspective. For instance, strength only relates to weapon usage, and not carry weight, because that would make too much sense. If your character is super strong.. you will still need to level up your ""Vitality"" IE your 'carry weight' basically. It's flat out stupid an annoying and causes the player to invest valuable experience points into something that shouldn't really matter.

*Level Design is pretty varied and actually cool as far as environments go. It's not all sunshine and rainbows in this regard though, you don't have the smooth flow like you do in bloodborne . The level design has a smooth flow through, but the ""areas"" are not completely connected... you'll see what I mean if you buy and play it.

*I want to mention level design here, miyazaki-san and team have particularly designed the levels to kill you. If you have a keen eye you'll start to pick up a pattern on how the levels are designed at certain areas to lead your eye, to distract you, a slight of hand. It makes the enemies already cheap abilities compound.

*Enemies like to shoot off attacks even though there already dead.

*Enemies can lock you in place.. even though technically stat wise your stronger than them... you'll be stuck in-between there legs rolling furiously trying to escape but to no avail as they just stun lock you with attacks.

*Trolls... Trolls flipping galore in online play. You'll literally get summoned by people, just out to make your bad day already rough. The summon by trolls happens less than the invasion by trolls, if you play online. Amongst the garbage their are gem players.. but its not worth it.

*Jolly cooperation is awesome when it happens, it does not happen enough. There is a rumor that the more hollow you go, that you cannot summon people. I think its your summon range just goes down to your own covenant?

*When your summoned to another world your resources as far as healing and magic estus used get shrunk down. To make this ""fair"", for who, I don't know?  Because it doesn't seem to work that way with invaders.

*Have I mentioned how some boss fights are gimmicky? Their no fun, they're just frustrating.. because its dodge dodge, roll, poke poke, dodge dodge.. .oh crap my stamina, dodge dodge. Oh look at that the boss just warped? Just did a 360 no scope on me?

*The platforming mechanics in the game are horrid at times. They really are, and this needs vastly improved. The new LaraCroft games did platforming and weapon combat mechanics really good. Smooth as butter.

*You can't turn the kick feature off, the kick is useful but the controls should be re-worked or re-mapped so you don't activate mid battle when your fighting something that completely ignores the kick.

*You can kick stone lizards off the cliff edge-Its awesome and brought many a smile to me after all the problems they had caused.

*Drop rates are funky, and need to be more consitent. Getting my drop rate up to 310, which I think is the max, tough enemies refused still yet to give up their wears. So to me it seems like you have two systems that have to work together. You have your drop rate system, and then the enemy has their own drop rate.. and its like  a key matching a lock. If you get ""lucky"" and the enemy is going to drop something..  yeah its a clustercluck.

*Super armor its a stat you cannot see, basically your fighting enemies.. and you keep wailing away the enemy will get stunned, and then it will immediatly refil, instantly, cheaply.. and you do it all over again. Its a garbage stat that will make the game seem harder than it is because you can't see it.

*The tracking with the enemies is god like. Part of this goes back to the ""Full motion animation, or lack there of up above""

*Your player characters tracking is garbage. From throwing items, to archery, your character does not track the enemies nearly as good as they track you.

*Archery is a lot better than dark souls 1 or 2. That being said, the tracking as mentioned above is garbage. So archery while it is in a way better, its just by a little bit. Plus the bows special abilities rather than rely on pure dexterity/strentgh/endurance, the team over fromsoftware thought that wasn't enough ""expense"" on the player and they throw in ""fp"" or basically ""magic consumption""...

*Items in the game are ridiculous expensive, so rather than have fun, buy items, go adventuring, its just a grind fest. Yeah late.. LATE in the game, you'll kill monsters that give a lot of souls (Currency/ experience points) and its going to be up to you what you want to do with them...  Shouldn't be this way though.

*Multiplayer system you have an infusion of PvP with PVE it doesn't work out. Trolls would argue that it ""adds depth to the game"" or some such nonsense.. but lets be real, is home invasion a fun thing? yeah no its not.. neither is it fun to have someone break in on you in the worst possible spot in game. This will happen. You can stop an invasion by making it to the boss room.

*Blue Tear stone ring works pretty good from my experience compared to DarkSouls1 least something was fixed?

*King of the storm is a very cheap boss- You guys remember that Dragon from DarkSouls 2 that liked to fly up and nuke the whole level with flame? Yeah..... welcome its 2nd cousin, divorced from a third sister, etc

*You recall how much fun, Bosses with mobs were? No... are you sure? What about the Smough and Orstein fight? No you didn't really like that did you? IT was like having victory snatched from your hands? Well a lot more bosses like this.

*Upgrade system is a LOT better than the previous games, in a way... because rather than having to farm the 90% of your weapon upgrade and rely on the crazy drop rates, you will have a character that can sell you most of the stuff unlimited after certain milestones for lots of souls.

*Bosses as an insult to you along with all other enemies.. when your summoned to help people, they will target you, and continue to wail on the spot you died as they are attacked by the other summons and host. I have no clue what's going on with the AI or programming in the game when this kind of stuff happens. Probably just something to piss off the player a lot?

*One issue I've noticed with the game, that FromSoftware has not fixed since DarkSouls1 which leads me to believe that they are either doing it on purpose or its just they don't know how to do any better.
What is this issue? Well lets say your in a heated fight, and you press attack twice, and then you try to roll away or dodge, your character will attack a third time when you hit the roll button, or whatever button you hit.. . So the game for some reason registers a different button as the attack button being pressed. I have no clue what this is. It happens randomly though. Like I said, heated battle..

*Whatever gender of character you play as, they have never done shots, and they don't know how to chug, so they are going to gingerly sip on their estus in battle, like an idiot, its going to get you killed many times. Dark Souls has one of the worst healing mechanisms from my perspective.

*Trolls-Laggy SOB who invade you-Just worth keeping in mind-It really does grow sickening after awhile and its just good to step away from the game. FromSoftware thought their invasion system is such a great thing.. but truth of the matter is just like with DarkSouls2 you could see the statistics and it was more cooperative play than invasions. The numbers spoke for themselves on what players really wanted. An then in Bloodborne coop players loved being able to silence the bell ringers. It was awesome not having to be distrubed by A-holes.

So if you read all of this, your probably a previous souls player. Your going to be like me, and probably give the game a shot no matter what. But I can honestly say, whenever another game publisher gets their act together.. (*Coughs* Capcom-DeepDown, never? *Cries*) and we get an honest to god really good ARPG that can compare to Dark Souls at least weapon and armor wise, and does better with the leveling and exploration and combat..and Cooperative play,  I'll switch over in a heart beat and never look back. Till that day happens though . . .

The game is not impossible to beat. You can get your Estus flask up to 15 and upgrade its ""power"" to 10. So you can get it up there and it will help YOU beat bosses, but won't help people who summon you because it gets cut in half more or less. A lot of enemies are going to require help even with this fact though. Like I said enemy response time, from physical attacks to spell casting, is far faster than player response time even with dexterity upgrades.. just the way it is. So it really nullifys a lot of the players ability. And you need someone else just to draw aggro so you can get a shot off. Its pretty rough.

Good luck and god speed!

Once again,the graphics are beautiful and the fairy transformation moves look amazing. The voice acting in English is well done and really adds a lot of humor and breaths specific traits in ach individual character. Speaking of characters two of my favorites in this game have to be Canadian accented Galdo  (A winner is us, hey?) And the voluptuous,fan service Harley (there's a lot of jiggle in those graphics) I also really enjoyed the soundtrack and am still kicking myself for not buying the bonus set which was released when the ps3 version was preordered. Out on a limb, does anyone out there know the name of the track to one of the games major bosses? All I can remember is that the boss was female and the music had a lot of intense violin which sounded incredible.

As for the differences between the ps4 and original ps3 release, you now have new storylines that branch off and give different endings. There is also the aspect of meeting certain characters at new times/under different circumstances as well as the gameplay mechanic no longer limiting your party to three people. New fairies can now be obtained which were unavailable in the original.

I really can't say enough good things about Fairy Fencer F Dark Advent. If there is any downside at all that might irritate some people, I would say that in the beginning there are quite a few of ""Eryn's Tutorials"" which can be a bit tiresome. However after the first couple hours or so these instances dwindle down and you can always view them again later in the help screen in case you are like me and sometimes lack patience. On a side note, Eryn looks pretty cute wearing librarian glasses!

In closing, I would recommend you pick up this title especially since JRPGs are getting harder and harder to find on the latest consoles. If we are lucky, maybe we will get a sequel or spin off.",Even better on PS4,1470182400,3,,

BUT it is a necessary evil if you have space issues on your ps4.

Let's start with THE BAD.
1-It doesn't fit 100%, it's on there good enough but it can come off (hasn't happened to me yet) so just be careful.
2-The cable design is done backwards (facing upside down) because they did not plan or maybe it was cheaper to have customers twisting the HDD cable plug in instead of having it plug in naturally.
3-Corrupted Data after 3 or 4 days of use

#3 MAY NOT HAPPEN TO YOU. Read more

My first guess was that the twisted cables allowed for data to be corrupted during my 3 to 4 day 750GB marathon of downloading. Next day my console acted as if no HDD was in. I did everything I could to fix it (restart, reinstall ps4 update, do initialization, unplug hdd and replug)

THE ONLY FIX was to plug hdd into pc (via usb3 extender in my case but any method will do), And I had to use a 3rd party program to rebuid the MBR (master boot record) which took a few seconds. Also scanned the whole 4TB hdd afterwards took many hours but no errors were found, HDD was as good as when it was new 3 to 4 days ago. So I tried again. Initialized and reinstalled update (the full file 800 mb or so) and again it worked but this time it had no issues. 2nd week now. I have no clue what caused the problem. I suggest buying a second HDD to back up ALL your data on a usb 3.0 extion drive. 4tb 5400rpm WD blue are cheap on amazon, like $100 and better than seagetes or samsung drives IMO","A necessary evil, it works now but has some issues.",1481500800,,,

I'd say this one is much more refined, and certainly seems more reliable. In particular, the analog sticks seem to have improved greatly, at least as far as using them playing Asphalt 8. The ""wings"" of the controller have been made a bit fuller which may make your palm muscles less tired after extended sessions (or not). And it comes with an integrated rechargeable battery which charges with a commonly available (to iOS and tvOS users) Lightning cable, so it can be topped off using the same cable you'd use for the Apple TV's remote. The gamepad is not useable while charging which seems a strange omission.

The newer controller is lighter, has a slight texture in its plastic shell and has a proper menu button in place of the previous pause button. The Bluetooth button and power switch are easier to deal with than the oddly labeled buttons being used previously. The D-pad is now a simple cross instead of the disc design previously and the buttons are shifted closer to the right analog stick.

On the AppleTV, both analog sticks and the D-pad can each  be used to navigate, as opposed to just the right stick on the older device.

My 10 year old son was happy playing through a level of Duck Tales with this controller with nothing negative to report, although the X key is probably not ideal for its use in that particular game. Regardless, it is certainly a much better controller than the Apple provided remote rotated into game mode. I've not been happy with the Apple remote for most tasks and especially not game play.  A perusal through the App Store indicates that many highly placed games do not support a gamepad interface, so you might want to see if your favorite game does.

The gamepad is fine for general Apple TV navigation. The analog sticks make for comfortable zipping around the interface, but the menu button is not well located for blind use.

I'm going to give this improved gamepad 5 stars as I gave its predecessor 4, and I will recommend it to anyone wanting to do semi-serious gaming on the 4th generation Apple TV.  There's been talk lately that the Apple TV has failed as a gaming platform, what with Disney pulling out their Infinity product, but for the occasional relaxed game, I've been OK with it, and this gamepad makes me more likely to try games that provide a gamepad interface.",An Improvement Over the Stratus XL,1459728000,3,,

5,False,"06 13, 2016",A8AU3DEOPEKUL,B01B61X1UC,Gauss,"Valkyria Chronicles (VC for short) is a relatively unknown gem from the PS3-era that is getting another chance to take center-stage in the PS4-era. While this generation and last were littered with remakes and remasters, this one is a welcome addition to the PS4 library that stands above the rest. It is that diamond in the rough.

The most important aspect of any game is the interactive component, after all that is the defining characteristic of a game. It is also where VC brings its unique flavor that warrants my strong recommendation. Being an ""SRPG,"" it is defined by the tactical nature of combat, similar to Final Fantasy Tactics. At the start of each ""turn"" you have so many moves you can make with your characters on the board. Each character has a defined role/class/job (Scout, Shock-trooper, Sniper, Lancer, Engineer, and Tank), which grants access to certain abilities. Much like RISK or Chess, the key aspect of the game is positioning your characters to take certain areas of the map for defense and attack other areas to accomplish the goals of the scenario.

What makes VC unique, even within the SRPG world, is the combination of turn-based and active combat. When you move one of your characters, you actually control them similar to a 3rd-person shooter. You have to navigate them around enemies, make sure to take cover when appropriate, and setup whatever action you command them to take (ex: where to throw that grenade, aiming at the enemy soldier's head, flanking the tank to shoot it from behind, etc). It really gives the gameplay a sense of action that other Strategy and RPG games don't have.

It is true that the underlying story is very ""JRPG""-ish, which brings about some less-than-subtle tone issues for typical western audiences; however, there is more than a little brilliance in some of the choices SEGA made to draw analogies between EW2 (the game's setting) and WW2 from our history. These choices make the story more interesting than your typical JRPG, particularly if you're willing to draw comparisons to their ""real life"" counterparts. Most importantly the story does a great job highlighting this rag-tag group of mercenaries trying to fight for their homeland across a backdrop of prejudice and a seemingly insurmountable military force. You get a sense of the motivations of each of the main characters, and each of the main characters has an arc that is incorporated into gameplay as side-quests and extra abilities. Simply put, the story is a feel-good story in a sea of dark, depressing garbage that is 95% of stories in modern gaming.

The remastered version also includes additional mission packs that highlight several support characters, this includes the shock-trooper Edy and her unit, as well as Selvaria, one of the antagonists. The remastered version also includes the Expert difficulty pack, which provides more maps. There is a lot of content here for the money.

Yes, this is a ""Remaster"" of a last generation game, but honestly this game is worth every penny of the price-point SEGA is asking. Do yourself a favor and play this game.","In a sea of same-y games and ripoffs, Sega delivers a unique experience from last generation",1465776000,,,

So I snagged this and enlisted my sister to help me write this review. Since she's a queen of Pros/Cons, I decided to put our combined input into a Pros/Cons list.

Pros:
1) Charges 2 devices simultaneously.
2) TWO spare battery packs that are removable.
3) Super long charge for light to medium use.
4) Matches the color of PS4 (this one is super important to people like us who notices these details).
5) The unit is small and doesn't use up a bunch of space.
6) Incredibly easy to use. It's literally plug and play.
7) Less risk to damage port. I had to ask her what this means, but apparently, the PS3 charger (as well as other PS4) chargers have risk to damage the charging part when plugging in the unit or various other ""charging"" functions. This one apparently does not have this.

Cons:
1) Battery pack is not flush with the controller. However, my sister said this was kind of a plus because that meant accidental trigger hitting decreased.

And that was it! When she started using this, she told me, ""I kick myself that I bought the $10 one, because this one is SO MUCH BETTER.""

As with all my electronic/long term use items, I'll post updates as needed. For now, I think we both agree this is a great product, one that we'll be using for a long time.

These sorts of games from others seen in the past are generally poorly made and the graphics are either bad or too difficult to play. But this game is totally different when compared with most other platform scrolling game I have seen thus far. This game clearly shows passion in which the developer created the animations. Kudos to the developer. Excellent job in rendering the graphics. Love the background and music is soothing. The game-play starts out to be very simple but beautiful to look at. The puzzles starts to get progressively hard but still not too hard to give-up easily. It has a good balance of fun and frustration to keep going. (Essential hallmarks of a good game)

But my main gripe has been the way the game saves the checkpoints as it progresses into levels. There is few I mean very few valid checkpoints that are automatically saved by the game and the user does not any choices. Having said, When you choose ""Restart Level"" or ""Quit"" you will not receive a second message asking ""Are you sure you want to Restart Level?"" or ""Are you sure you want to quit?"" which can be a challenge if a young child is playing as they assume that the last checkpoint would be maintained but I was wrong. Depending on how far out you are in a level you may have to start the progress of that level all over again which makes me feel slightly frustrated. Please make sure that if you want to restart your level or quit the game you must complete a level before choosing these options.

The beauty of the game is the depth of field which is particularly amazing treat to watch and play and the overall style definitely makes me want to forgive any issues that one faces regarding checkpoints offered in the game but in reality I am forced to rate this with 3 stars and hope that the developer will issue a patch update with more checkpoints that are saved when one quits the game. If frequent checkpoints ideally whenever it finds new yarn would be ideal to make this game more enjoyable for little ones who play these.

It brings many changes the most noteworthy is the lack of pokemon gyms but the game makes this work well.  The other is the introduction is Z moves there is one for each pokemon type lus ones for each final evolution of the starter trio as well as one for pikachu and another for Snorlax although that oe is only obtainable in an event that is soon to end so it will soon be unobtainable.

The new pokemon are the usual mix of cool looking and useful to the odd balls and the ones of questionable use.  A particular favorite is Mimikyu a ghost/fairy type.  The main drawback the newest crop of pokemon is they all seem to suffer to varying degrees  from low speed stats especially the starters when compared to the starters of previous games.  The other is popplio  the water starter  it's  starting form is fine once it evolves it becomes problematic as it takes on a very female esque form which if it was a female only or mostly likely to be female.

The actual situation is just he opposite popplio has a 87.5 % chance  of being male and only a 12.5% chance of being female.  Now pokemon that have a definite female or male look to them is hardly new , it dates back to the original games but this is the first time a starter has had the issue and perhaps the first time  the odds of getting the gender the pokemon most resemble is so low.

The Npcs are great an entertaining  the new professor is a hoot.  The story is excellent there is much i could  say about but i shall avoid giving spoilers.

4,False,"09 30, 2016",A2BWLVUB0806JE,B01CEFEMFW,Joseph Cutcher III,"Just went to BestBuy today and bought this for $150.

----------------
Backstory:
As far as all mice go I've owned the Logitech's G500, G500s, and M570. Just recently got a Razer Mamba for two weeks, and I also tried the G502 and G700s for two weeks (bestbuy no restocking fee baby). I will be judging this mouse in direct comparison to all of the above, and how I feel it stands up to the price tag.

----------------
Day 1:
Wow. That's my initial impression, because the $150 Mamba left me with some doubts. After almost two weeks of having the Mamba i was expecting the g900 to be heavy like the Mamba. Instead it is very light. The G900 is much lighter and I can feel the difference.

I played Black Ops 3 a lot recently, and before the Mamba I didn't realize how important weight was. It turns out heavy mice make quick movement harder and exhausting. It's lighter than the mouse I've been using (G500s)

The other things i'm noticing is size, and the left and right click. I like the size, for me the way the mouse sits in my hand matters alot. It's why I have the G500s, it's a big mouse that supports my hand. So far, the same seems to be true of the g900. Finally, i like how the mouse sounds and feels when i ""click"" the two main buttons. It's nice, and even after adjustments i didn't like the feel of the Mamba mouse. It's rubberish texture, shape, and feel of the clicks just wasn't great for me. This mouse seems to work better that way. It feels more matter of fact in my hand.

Wireless range. I bought the Mamba for $150 bucks, and yet i could not move the transmitter to the top of my tower. Which sits on my desk, with a monitor in between the transmitter and the mouse. The Mamba was unusable like that, and they were only literally 3 feet apart. I had to keep the Transmitter close to the mouse pad, and even then i very occasionally had input interrupted there.

By The Way for the mamba review go here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3G41O59P6IQZG/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm which compares the $150 mouse to the $80 G500s (not fair i know, but that's all i had to compare it to)

So curious, i plug the transmitter to the front of the case which put the g900 in the same position, and i'm having zero issues. Which is fantastic. There isn't much else to say because after two weeks it works flawlessly.

Charging method. I will say this, Mamba is already winning. The Mamba has every charging option the g900 has + a station. Why's the matter? if i want to charge the g900 i have to plug it into the provided cable...why is that a problem? wear and tear. I fear the micro USB port on the g900 will get loose and wear out overtime from the constant plugging and unplugging, and to anyone who's had USB ports break i think you know my pain. It happens a lot. The Mamba has a station that you just gently rest the mouse on in addition to the wired option.

The g900's wired has two stiff plastic prongs that push into the molding of the mouse. I suspect that this is to keep the port from wiggling, but i'm not sure it'll work. Still, it does look like they at least thought about my above concern. *The Mamba also had something similar on their cord that looked more equipped for the situation. HOWEVER that mouse is also much heavier and after experiencing the negative effects of that extra weight i'm never going back to a heavy mouse.

The lack of a charging station means that i must have both the wire and the transmitter plugged into two separate USB ports. Why? if i plug the transmitter into the wire that means i need to unplug the transmitter everytime i want to charge the mouse, which i can forgive if the mouse truly can last 24-32 hours under constant and intense use (remains to be seen, and you bet your butt i'll leave it on all day in at max settings just web surfing in between games)

Next, i really like that the featured ambidextrous thumb buttons can all 4 be plugged in at the same time and function as 4 seperate buttons. However, i can't comment yet on how natural or easy it is to have my ring and pinky finger pressing buttons. I also like that the 4 buttons are magnetic (how? with such low wait just how? i guess magnets are pretty light?) they pop off and on easy.

Finally, the box looks like a hundred bucks. It looks nice once you get the plastic wrapping and sleeve off, feels nice with it's texture, and when you open it you feel like your being proposed to with the best ring money can buy. My wife was jealous, and she doesn't game.

Day 3
---------------------
So before i forget, lets start with the cons.

-Wish i didn't need to have the wire and the transceiver on two separate USB ports. I find this to be acceptable but for the money i want it all.
-i hate that the LED lighting sits exactly under your palm...this means you never ever see it while in use. Completely stupid idea because it just makes me sad when i see how cool it looks when i'm not using it. For the money i do not find it acceptable to pay for a light i can't see. just remove the damn thing and save me some cash.
-i wish the two DPI profile buttons were positioned for the left index finger just like the G500s because i really felt they were comfortable there. I just remember i once tried the G700s and G502 for two weeks...doesn't compare, the G900 blows the G602 out of the water in weight, battery life, and feel. but i did like the buttons on the G700s. The 502 side buttons felt really nice, but it really pisses me off that the sniper button is so far forward on the mouse that i actually have to life my palm up off the mouse to use it...which makes it unusable in my mind. it hurts my hand doing all that extra lifting. I can live with this, but i'll always wish i could use the more natural feel of having the two buttons at my index and this will consequently mean i won't use these much. nvm that kinda makes me hate it.
-the mouse wheel is still not suitable for actually pressing down on it. it is better than the G500s but honestly - not really. If you playing an intense game that needs you to press down on it with any kind of speed like Crysis 1, or Black Ops 3 then you will scroll when you don't want to. Very annoying, and basically means i'll train myself not to use this at all while gaming except for when i don't care if it scrolls. I suspect that logitech actually needs to make the wheel itself bigger. not in width but length. Considering this issue has been present since the G500 i am not happy.

These are the 4 i can think of, and i found the top one to be the least annoying and the bottom one to be the worst. However for $150 i find them all to be very annoying.

So far, would i buy it again? Not at full price. All the Positives about it are very strong. That is to say, it does what it does better than i've seen in any other mouse and that's why it hurts so much to see that the wheel hasn't improved from the G500 and that my other two favorite buttons got moved to one of my least favorite fingers.

I just can't afford full price for something that still has flaws from 2 generations back.

on my 2 week summary i'll list any opinions that changed between now and then, and give you a bigger comparison between the several mouses i've owned or at least tried for two weeks.

2 Week Summary
---------------------
So going back to my G500s, i realize that the g900 is a smaller body. I found myself holding the g900 with my ring finger on the RMB. Which is odd for me because i hold the larger g500s with my middle finger on the RMB. The frame isn't much smaller, but enough for those who like the G500s the way it is to think about how important that large size is. Also the G900 doesn't have as pronounced ot comfortable thumb rest, which i noticed immediately when i went back tot he g500s. One thing i think i forgot to mention, was the G900 charges impressively fast. Maybe 2 hours tops, and it absolutely last for days.

After using about 15 minutes it loosened up and work perfectly. He has the Forza 5 edition Xbox one and when you turn on the console the racing wheel will turn as it comes on, if it is plugged in.

I tend to like wireless headsets when I am gaming on a console.  Mainly that is because the even if I use a wired headset I am typically connecting through my wireless controller anyways.

However, when gaming on my PC I use a wired headset, and out of all the wired headsets I have used this one is by far the best.  First, I have a very large head and this set when set to its largest size fits me comfortably.  Which is rare when it comes to gaming headsets.

The ear cushions are simply the softest I have ever worn.  Like a soft memory foam that contours perfectly to the sides of my head.  Great at isolating outside noise and yet it still stays cool and you have no ear sweat.  Also, if you wear glasses the cushions have soft spots to allow them to contour around the glasses, so it doesnt squeeze your head, I like it so that I can use some digital glasses I have that reduce eye strain.

The sound, is freakin amazing.  In playing games it is clear, crisp and distortion free.  You can hear quiet footsteps, and you can hear loud rumbling bass equally well.  And then if you just want to listen to music with these bad boys you will be impressed I promise.  Everything sounds great with this headphones, form Jazz to Death Metal.  I kind of love them for their sound quality.

The microphone is removable and pretty good.  Slightly above average if you compare it with others.  No complaints but no one ever said it made me sound great.  It is fairly flexible, it will stay in place and it is removable.

As far as control for the headset go there really are none.  On the cord you have a mic on and off switch and that is it.  Any other control you have to do through your hardware, which in the end is fine I guess.

I have always been into WW1 but never really knew too much about it since they barely teach it in schools. That's why I love the trivia they add in the loading screens (which take TOO long even for team deathmatch). This game looked amazing, and it still does. I love the dynamic weather changes, but it changes too quickly. It will be clear as day one minute and then before you know it you can't see because it's a fog fest. I really wish they made repairing your planes, tanks, etc a bit faster honestly. I was in a fighter plane on Monte Grappa (not that it really matters) and I nearly died trying to repair my plane. This was also a problem in the campaign. I was playing the last mission in ""Through Blood and Mud"" and had trouble getting through the first half of the city without getting light up like the fourth of July. The campaign has too many stealth missions for a World War 1 game. One second I'll be in a massive tank battle and the next I'll be sneaking up on people with a shovel (which I have a lot of fun with). The ""Nothing Is Written"" mission I can totally understand since that's how Lawrence of Arabia carried out his quests. I don't understand why there are so many stealth missions with the Australian against the Ottomans. Let's go back to the cover of the game for a second. Why is this guy on the cover when he had little to do with the actual story? Honestly, I'd love to have the driver from Through Blood and Mud and the guy you play as during the Italian mission on the cover than this stupid guy Now back to the multiplayer for a second. This is just me, but I don't like most of th3 default maps, thus why I got the premium pass. I don't like Monte Grappa, Empire's Edge, Ballroom Blitz, and I have mixed feelings about Fao Fortress. I mainly play Team Deathmatch so make of that what you will. One more thing, why does it take so long to level up both in game and in classes?? I've played more than 14 hours with the medic and support class. I'm level 1 in medic and level 0 in support. That's ridiculous.

Why am I giving this 2 stars? For 2 reasons, 1. The hit impact is just terrible! Some guns won't kill right away even if you get a headshot. You literally need to get atleast 3 shots in to get a kill from some guns. It doesn't make any sense to have to land 3 shots on an enemy's neck area and up. In real life , 1 shot would have done the trick.

2. This reason is why I stopped playing the game. I should have listened to the other reviewers before I spent 35 dollars on this game. That reason is having to play against hackers!!! These guys can see through walls, snipe you with a machine gun, have armor that requires you to use more bullets than you need.  I unloaded 15 rounds of ammo in the upper body of a medic and it makes no sense for him to be able to turn around and shoot me with a pistol after unloading 15 rounds.

I have, however, played Zelda and also Minecraft. This game is essentially Zelda, Minecraft, and some Tower Defense aspects combined. If you like all of those then you will most likely enjoy this game.

This game is not a Minecraft clone exactly. There are more differences then there are similarities to Minecraft. Dragon quest doesn't have a free build mode like Minecraft has until the end of the story. The story will take approximately 60 hours to complete (100 hours if you do side quests/exploring). The story itself has 4 chapters (4 long chapters obviously). Again, having never played a Dragon Quest game before, it feels like Zelda. You run around similarly to Zelda: Windwaker if you have ever played that. The world does look like Minecraft but it is not 100% randomized. However, the world is huge so it's not that big of a deal.

There is crafting but it is way easier then Minecraft. The recipes are provided as you progress through the story. There are also many different types of land (mountainous, tropical, forest, etc.). The main aspect of this game is the story which also incorporates building followed by tower defense type attacks on your villages.

The part I don't like about this game is that I cannot find a way to have multiple characters. I believe there can only be one character which is disappointing when you have a son who wants to play that will more then likely blow up your entire town like I had happen to me. In addition, I cannot for the life of me find a way to go back to the main menu. You have to close the application and reopen it to go back to the main menu. I don't understand why it's like this. Last, saving requires you to go to a save ""beacon"" kind of thing which is in your town. If you are far away from town and have to go to work, well, sorry you have to run all the way back to town first. I will also mention that the first hour or so of gameplay is super boring. Get past that and it's a lot better. It's like a forced 1 hour tutorial at the beginning.

Overall, 8.5/10 for me. Again, if you like Zelda, Minecraft, and Tower Defense games, this is a good one for you. The cons are pretty minor. Great game overall.",REVIEW - NEVER PLAYED DRAGON QUEST,1480464000,4,,
4,False,"01 22, 2017",A26JKEK8AWJME1,B01GD4928C,Bruce Statton,"Once I heard back before the game was released that they excluded Showcase mode to focus more on MyCareer and Universe modes, I was excited, but ultimately disappointed because they did not seem to change much from the previous game, except for only the presentation. And I have played many hours and matches within both modes to see only little changes.
MYCAREER:
The Ranking system takes way too long to climb to the top. You stay stuck at a position for many long months while other superstars are changing their ranks weekly. Although I have to admit that I like how long it takes to actually win a championship. Still, there needs to be other stories going on and the ranking system needs to be more genuine.
You fight the same superstars over and over again on a weekly basis. There really is no randomness to your match contenders. I would always fight John Cena for weeks on end. Always fight John Cena about 90% of the time for the U.S. title at all pay per views.
The Authority interrupts your promos about 70% of the time (if you're not in a rival) and puts you in a special match. Again, youll fight the same wrestler, even though you were scheduled to fight someone else. Every time the Authority has put me in a match, I always had to go against Sheamus.
Title matches are only for pay-per-view events, never on Raw or Smackdown. Not sure how this works for NXT. But I would love to have title matches on Raw or Smackdown every once in a while. The Authority likes to put me in Ladder matches and I have a championship title, but it is never a title match.
Cut scenes are always the same. There really is no story for rivalries. Just the same cut scenes youve already experienced in a previous rivalry.
I wish they would include more stories with cut scenes in previous games like Here Comes the Pain and Shut Your Mouth. They need to go back to Season mode. Especially since they went back to text based dialogue for promos and interviews. They need to go back and reference the season mode in Here Comes the Pain. There was way more to do in that season mode from a game that is about 14 years old.
I won the Royal Rumble, and did not have any cut scenes or stories until I went to Wrestlemania. There was a small scene where Paul Heyman warned me about going against Brock Lesnar. Pretty lame.
Interviews happen randomly, but sometimes you're asked questions about something that did not even happen. I was asked, Why did you attack him tonight? When I didn't attack anybody.
Text based promos are nice, but there only seems to be a set amount of actual text options. Ive read the same text based choices numerous times. And when you're in a promo battle, the options don't seem to make any sense. There is no flow to the promo conversation.
Promos are fun at first, and I only engage in promos now to grab extra VC, which isn't a lot, but every bit helps to upgrade my created superstar.
Once you upgrade to a certain overall, matches are incredibly easy, even on the higher difficulties.
You can gain lots of VC for wearing a signature shirt which is cool. I just wish we could also change our managers attire as well to fit our own style more.
I wish we could skip the show film intro in the beginning and cut right to the arena when the pyrotechnics start.
The manager should follow you closer in your entrance, like how Paul Heyman and Lana are close to Brock Lesnar and Rusev. Instead of being so far behind when walking down the ramp. There should be more manager/superstar entrances to pick from when creating an entrance.
The AI needs to have a more dominant career presence within my career. They seem to just be your typical boring AI that has random matches against each other that have no stories or rivalries of their own, which makes my career the center of the universe which is pretty unrealistic.
Rivalries have a record score keeper with how many matches have been won or lost, but I wish they would keep all your matches on record like in Here Comes the Pains season mode.
If you're not in a rivalry or the Authority hasn't set up a special match for you, most of the time on Raw, the superstar you're supposed to fight will attack you during your entrance and you will not have a match.
MyCareer is not all bad though. I have had many good matches and rivalries. Sometimes your rival will get the better hand on you during run-ins which is fun.
I do not get the whole Authority challenge. There does not seem to be any difference if you are favored or not favored by the Authority.
MyCareer is definitely better than the last two games, but there is much to fix, add and incorporate in order to make it a unique enjoyable experience.

UNIVERSE MODE:
The same cut scenes play out the same on every show. So, if you have a certain cut scene that happened the first week of a rivalry on Raw, then that same exact cut scene will happen on the first week of Smackdown for a different rivalry, even though you're watching the same cut scene unfold. It is very boring, common and predictable.
You can change rivalry matches, but once edited cut scenes do not seem to play out.
Once you add superstars to certain shows you can look at just that set of superstars which is cool for managing your Universe. However, when you edit a match, youll get the whole entire roster to choose from instead of just being able to view who is actually on that show, which can be a little bit puzzling when you have multiple shows a week with a set number of superstars.
Statistical record keeping is very basic and you cannot review past shows to see who won or lost.
You cannot permanently assign managers to superstars.
The presentation is pretty nice, with how match cards are presented and the inclusion of commentary inside the show introduction.
Having the freedom to make matches and rivalries is cool, but I wish rivalries would have more choices and outcomes.
I kind of wish they would bring back GM mode or include some aspects of it through Universe mode.

EXHIBITION:
Multi-man matches are still a huge pain to play even with the roll out feature. And I do love the roll out feature.
Weapons, tables, ladders and chairs have no weight to them. You set up a table, only to have the referee or another superstar walk into it and push it away across the ring.
Weapons do not have a lot of grapple moves to them. Most of the time you swing, only to swing away from the target you're trying to hit.
Table finishers and moves are in, which is very nice. They need to add in the same thing for ladders now.
There should be weapon OMG moments, like for chairs, steel steps, sledgehammers, etc.
Steel Cage, Hell in a Cell, and Elimination Chamber matches need a revamp.
Ladder matches are better in this installment, but they still need a lot of work to them. Mostly being able to use the ladder to execute grapple moves on superstars. And if a superstar lands on a ladder that is laying down in the ring, they should react to hitting it.
I want more double title entrances and victory scenes. There need to be more title match entrances in general and even include a Money in the Bank briefcase entrance.
Tag team matches need to be less aggravating or the AI just needs to be smarter.
I wish we could switch back and forth between the wrestler we chose to play and the AI wrestler, just to make the match more interesting. Just like how we can switch between the wrestlers on our tag team.
The AI should do more OMG moments.
I wish the AI would do their signatures and then go right into their finisher, unlike Goldberg for example. He always goes for the pin after the spear, which is not what he does in real life. John Cena on the other hand always goes for the FU after the 5 knuckle shuffle which is how it actually happens.
I wish we could have custom entrance music.
I want them to bring back Match Creator! I want to make my own rules and matches.
I do love that they use in game renders for superstars. They have done this in the past and it makes your created superstars look like they belong.
Commentary needs to be better or just be left out altogether.
Gameplay is fun, but there are still a number of bugs and glitches you encounter with grapples and targeting.
The Main menu looks great, I just wish all the options would fit inside a single screen with no side scrolling.
6 man battle royal matches should also include pin and submission, not just over the top.
Dragging wrestlers around should be quicker. And I am mostly talking about when you're walking a wrestler around the ring and ringside.
Backstage area should also include a parking lot.
The Creation Suite is the best it has been in years. Although there should be more options for body morphing.
There should not be any separation from Superstars, Created Superstars and Downloaded Superstars. They should all be in the same menu when selecting wrestlers.
I don't normally bother with any online matches, but Im pretty sure Ive heard of lag problems and servers usually being down.
People have created some pretty cool stuff in the Community Creations, which have downloaded fine for me without any errors.
The roster is huge! But I still think they had well enough time to update certain superstars attire and entrances that they seemed to just ignore.
In the end, this is a really good game. I know I have my criticisms, but I am very much enjoying this installment of WWE 2K. More so than the past 2 games, and WWE 2K16 was a lot of fun. I just want more creative stories and inclusions within MyCareer and Universe mode. Or maybe just combine those with some Showcase mode features and go back to a Season mode, which would be pretty awesome. I like the gameplay and love the presentation of the game, but there are still minor and major bugs that need fixing and programming. I feel like they keep nailing it on the appearance side of the game, when they really need to focus more on the features and gameplay elements that they seem to keep overlooking.
Lets start by bringing back Match Creator and adding in more weapon grapple moves, please.

1,False,"04 8, 2017",A3RL65MHEM9U59,B01GKHJP98,Ligia Ecchavarria,"This is the first main entry in this now beloved series that I despise with a passion unlike for any other JRPG I've played. Where Persona 3 and 4 managed to raise the bar for the series after the long stretch of downtime from Revelations Persona and Persona 2 Innocent Sin/Eternal Punishment, Persona 5 does nothing to raise the bar for the series. It offers a cast of characters that is very much crafted around the same old tired tried and dry tropes and cliches of anime, manga, and video games of the 90s and 2000s. Now in the 2010s you'd think ATLUS would've walked away from that and done something to revolutionize the series.

The problems with this game don't end there. This series continues to boast too much dungeon crawling with this entry. At least it follows in Persona 4's footsteps of making the dungeons more interesting than Persona 3's recolored blocks for a 250+ floor tower (Tartarus). However it's still a flaw that needed to be brought up. Oh and the turn based combat is also a problem. It's 2017 ATLUS not 1997, if Square's Final Fantasy can move away from it why can't your Persona series?

The story/plot, is actually quite a step backwards. Whoever thought it'd be a good idea to make us play as anti heroes/pseudo villains needs some serious help. And the way this story ends is about a hundred times more upsetting than the canon ending for Persona 3. It's an ending that leaves me feeling like nothing was actually resolved or accomplished over the course of the game.

I hate the look of this game. It looks like Eternal Sonata meets film noir. This is a game made for the PS3 released onto the PS4 without taking advantage of any of the hardware's capabilities in the next generation console. It gives the game a dated feel all around which coupled with the gameplay and characters only makes the game look a hundred times worse.

The music for this game is forgettable and bland IMHO. The most standout track is the returning incarnation of the Velvet Room theme first used in Persona 3 way back in 2005-2006. I also have a huge issue with the Velvet Room itself. The fact it's a prison isn't my issue oddly enough (though I could do with less bondage sex slave imagery and overtones). I don't like Caroline and Justine at all, and Igor has been downright destroyed since Persona 4. Where Igor has always been creepy, he's never felt less welcoming than he does in this game.

A closing complaint as I'm going to go crack this game in half and throw it out my window as soon as I'm done with this review; I don't appreciate how I'm surrounded by a bunch of jerks for NPCs and supporting cast members. From Sakura-san to Kawakami-san to random school students I can eavesdrop on everybody's a prick. I play video games specifically RPGs to escape such people not to deal with more of them. If I wanted to deal with jerks I'd just live my real life not the life of this god forsaken protagonist.

After using these with the PlayStation VR, I can safely say they are perfect.  They fit nicely over the VR headset and actually feels and looks like it's the official part of the set.  I can't even imagine using the provided stereo earbuds instead of these.  The 3D sound works amazingly well while playing VR games.  Truly an amazing headset to complement the PlayStation VR experience!

Turtle Beach has become the gold standard for gaming headphones in recent years and this set does not fail to impress!  The on/off switch is a nice feature to avoid battery drainage, and the on/off switch for the microphone is also a nice added feature.  The ability to hear yourself talking from the mic to your ears in the headset is a neat feature that is cooler than what I initially had thought.  The volume and bass adjuster dials are easily assessable.

The sound quality is very nice and the bass booms deep!  The over ear style does a pretty good job in cancelling outside noise.  The one gripe is that these can get very, very loud which could be an issue for kids or teenagers playing them way too loud.  I also like but dislike the rechargeable battery.  It's great for money saving initially, but a lot of avid headphone wearers like the option to use regular batteries when the batteries inevitably no longer hold their charge.

All in all, I'm really impressed by the quality and features of this headset!

While the game's story is long, it's simplistic and average. Mass Effect (the original) had a reasonably complicated story and even more complicated battle scenarios. Andromeda has taken that mold and mostly dumbed it way down into an average non-RPG RPG. What I mean is that it's an RPG wannabe. It has some elements of an RPG such as a quest log, but they're pretty much all fetch quests and it's mostly on a rail. I'm all for a few fetch quests in an RPG, but give me something more than that. It tries hard to be an RPG, but never makes it.

As for the bugs, there's plenty. In addition to the screen-tear-city with most cut scenes and frame rates that at times reach 10 FPS during gameplay, there are a plethora of bugs... some bugs that require that you save your place where you are, quit out and restart to continue. For example, with one of the Architect battles, the leg's armor was already depleted to zero, but the game wouldn't progress to the next phase. There were a number of these no progress scenarios. I had to quit and start the entire battle over again from the beginning to finally make progress. There are also lesser bugs, but they're distracting none the less. Like, a closeup shot of Ryder where his tongue goes through his teeth and it looks like there's a worm crawling on it. Just a little bit disturbing to say the least and totally ruined whatever that cut scene was about. Like characters sliding across an entire room without walking. If you rest your PS4, when you turn it back on, the game won't automatically reconnect to the network. Instead, you have to save your game, quit out to the main menu, wait for it to reconnect then reload your game. The game doesn't automatically reconnect. Note, I'm playing this on a PS4 Pro, so there is no excuse for this level of basic graphics problems.

When your character dies, many reload times can exceed 8 minutes. I'm not kidding. I have waited so long that I thought the game was hung. I then quit out of the game, restart it and then it took that long again. The second time I took a break and got some food. Sometimes I'll even flip over to my computer and read email while I wait. In fact, I got so bored of the long loading times, I finally just gave up and put the game on narrative hardness level just to get through without any further character deaths. I just couldn't wait for those excruciatingly long load times any longer. I don't mind when games are hard as long as they reload quickly. I just can't spend 8-10 minutes waiting for a game to load up after 2-3 minutes of play and a character death. It's ridiculous.

The story itself is reasonable, but not perfect. Effectively, Andromeda is about sending arks of people who escape the Milky Way galaxy to head to the Andromeda galaxy in search of a new home. This apparently happened right before the Reapers wiped the Milky Way. The point is that your character becomes the human Pathfinder who is tasked to find (or make) habitable planets. These races all left as a last ditch effort to save the Milky Way races from extinction... with the exception of the Volus, Quarians, Hannar and Elcor (among others) who were conspicuously absent in Andromeda. The Turians, Asari, Krogan and Salarians as well as Humans are all present in Andromeda. We also get to meet a new race called the Angara. We also meet a new enemy in both the Kett and the Remnant as well as the passive enemy, the Scourge. As a Ryder and Pathfinder, you quest the planets to find the ones you can clean up, clear out and terraform to make it habitable for those who traveled in each ark. There are were, according to the game, 5 total arks sent. A human ark, a turian ark, an asari ark, a salarian ark and another ark with a mix of races including the rest of the Krogan. You don't find the fifth ark in this game. Each ark contained a large number of cryo pods which would be unthawed when the time was right.

The battles are repetitive and regenerative. This means that even though you go clear out an area, the next time you drive past it in the Nomad, the enemy is back again and you have to keep clearing it out. I finally gave up with that and just floored it and drove right past. For me, it was more important to finish the quest than have random skirmishes that don't really mean anything.

Driving around on the planet, you're given a six wheel ground vehicle called the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nomad-ND1/dp/B01MREH4H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nomad ND1</a>. Yet, there are plenty of shuttles and other air transports that you find and could use. But, no, The game won't allow it. You're stuck with the Nomad or running around on foot. So, set up your forward stations quickly so you can fast travel the map. The maps aren't very large across and there's not much on the maps to see. There are settlements here and there on some planets, but in general there's little to see and do other than scrounge containers and read datapads.

As for the fighting mechanics, the VATS is gone. It only has aim assist and that's weak at best. The menu system is fair, but the quest log is the most horrible quest log I've yet to find in a game of this type. Leveling up perks is not even much fun. I found myself auto leveling as that system seems to do a decent job. It didn't seem to matter how you leveled your character up, just that you did.

Note, I only played single player campaign mode. This is what I like and what I play. I did not get into the multiplayer part at all. There are plenty of other reviews on Amazon that discuss the multiplayer aspects to this game.

Overall, I liked the game and it takes a reasonable amount of time to play when you play through all of the quests. I'm giving this 3 stars out of 5.

I had only just a few weeks before redesigned my living room to appear more grown up and mature, then this totally rad mask changes my life and I simply had to make room for it. It's super out of place next to all my books on my nice shelf, but months later I look at it and still adore it. It is, sadly pretty narrow. It would have taken very little effort to widen it just a tad, because lengthwise, it would fit just fine! The ring I could honestly have gone without. It's cumbersome and not practical for wearing. If the design was smaller and more subtle I'd probably wear it, but it's pretty chunky. The poster is super sweet too! Can't go wrong with double sided! Except I actually loved both sides equally and didn't know which to show off!
I bought this having only played a fraction of the first many years ago. I knew I loved it, but it was hard to get into for some reason. It wasn't my usual play style being that stealthy. But I thought the remastered version might help me adjust to the...pretty clunky graphics.

I was using traditional AA Batteries when I first got my X Box One, however they would last no more than 8 hours of use on (less with games that use a lot of rumbling) so I was going through a pair of AA batteries usually every 2-3 days.  Its also clear that the controllers have a high minimum threshold for the battery as batteries I have taken from these have been inserted in other devices (like radios and flashlights) and still have a significant charge in them.  A rechargeable solution such as this Nyko Charge Block was basically a must.

Two problems with it however:  First off the white variant (as I have a White X Box and controller) costs more.  This only bothers me mildly, as I bought the black one anyway since I don't care about the look...but it feels wrong to me.  Secondly the indicator for charging.  These blocks blink on and off when charging, which is ridiculously bright as well and emits from both sides of the block.

Many of the old shooters on consoles predating the PS2 are just too tedious and are too much of a chore to play these days.  Dual analogue controls were a very foreign concept during the time before Timesplitters and Halo came around.  By default, Quake II does not use the analogue controls, and you will not find an option for them.  However, you click that little button that makes the red light show up on your controller (I forgot what it is called) and more control options appear.  None of them are ideal, but the best setup is the very last one.  It sets the right analogue stick to look around just like modern shooters.  For whatever reason, you still have to use the d-pad for moving forward, backward, and strafing left to right.  L1 is set to shoot, L2 is for jumping, and the other two triggers cycle through your weapons.  Those are all the controls you need for this game.  It is a bit awkward at first, but it does not take long at all to adjust.  If you are playing this game on the original Playstation, you can also use the Dual Shock 2 controller from the PS2.

With the controls out of the way, what do I think about the game?  I think, considering the time this game came out and the hardware it was made for, it is a very impressive game.  The Quake series has always been about moving quickly and dodging serious firepower while not really having anything to hide behind.  I think this Playstation version really delivers.  It's a very smooth game with tight controls.  The running and gunning is just as satisfying as you can expect from a good, old school shooter.  Once you get good at the game, you will feel like a total bad ass blasting your way through enemies with the Super Shotgun.

The soundtrack is great for this game, and it is a major step up from the original Quake in my opinion.  The sound in this game in general is great.  The sounds of the weapons firing (especially the quad damage sound effects), the sounds the enemies make when you approach them, and the grunt your player makes when he jumps is all so iconic.  I will never get tired of hearing the sounds from the Quake games.

The graphics are decent for original Playstation standards.  They get the job done.  Really, by now if you are trying to decide on games to buy for the original Playstation, graphics are not really that important to you.

If you are out there collecting original Playstation games, this is one you should buy.  It's a very impressive game for the hardware it was developed for, and it is a very playable game in 2016.",Quake II is still a great game,1472601600,,,

The sound though is much better: from reloading your weapons to the sound of a flash bang, the atmosphere is lovely.

There are some minor glitches, such as getting stuck on walls while climbing or stepping; something very hindering when you get to later levels that require stealth.

And the difficulty may put some people off. First off, you must spend several minutes in planning before each mission. The problems come when you start the level and most of your teammates just run and get themselves killed, no matter how well you planned it out. I find myself just having everyone hold while I do it myself; which is difficult seeing as how the enemies will kill you the instant you see them, leaving you with the options of shooting them in the back, or tossing a flash-bang everytime you enter a room.

But that aside, the game is pretty fun. And you finally get to play as Ding.

I like how you get to be the villain who is a greedy little bastard and try and amass a fortune throughout the game.  The treasure hunting is fun and reminded me a lot of Kirby's Super Star for the SNES.  That game was a blast and the best part was finding all the treasure pieces.

But Wario's play control does feel a little bit clunky.  It would have been nice to have more variety of the mini games to get more coins.  If they had a slot machine type of thing like Super Mario Bros 2 had that could have been really fun.  The multiple ending sequences are nice and pretty cool enhancing the replay value of the game.

Overall it is an enjoyable game for a few minutes but the farther you get in the game the coins seem to be fewer and fewer almost scarce.  The game needed more cloud bonus levels like in the original Super Mario Bros where you could get a ton of coins in one shot.  Or vice versa the tunnel bonus levels where you just find coins going down the pipes.  I understand the game marker wanted to differentiate Wario Land from Super Mario Bros but they were basically operating under the same platform and guidelines.

It would have been funny to see Wario steal coins from King Koopa Bowser.  Either way the game is just a little above average.  I would rate it 3 to 3 1/2 stars.  I thought the boss battles were somewhat lacking. After you finish the game I kept thinking the game should have been funnier than that.  There was not a lot of desire to play through it again and again to see all the endings.  The music also seemed to be subpar compared to the other SML games.

5,False,"02 18, 2017",A3PRDWD3JMF485,B00002SUCW,Triforce Of Power,"The beat 'em up genre dominated video games from the late 80's to the early 90's. Starting with the original Double Dragon arcade game, the beat em up genre is still my favorite genre of video games. The Simpsons, X-Men, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Streets of Rage, Final Fight...all great examples of how great the genre was when it was well-executed by the likes of Konami, Capcom, Sega, etc. While the genre may have kicked off with the original Double Dragon arcade, it most certainly came to an end with Final Fight 3 on Super Nintendo in 1995, forever unable to match the success of then-popular tournament fighter video games, such as Street Fighter II and the Mortal Kombat games.

Before I jump into the review, I find it imperative to firstly discuss the price. As of the time of this writing, the price for a SNES authentic copy of Final Fight 3 is very high, anywhere between $100-$200, usually hovering at about $145. This is a pretty steep price, especially considering Final Fight 1 can be had for about $12 and Final Fight 2 can be had for about $45. The heavy price tag can be attributed to the facts that Final Fight 3 is a very desirable game as well as a late addition to the SNES library (1995). The good news is that reproduction cartridges are being sold at a much more reasonable price, but this is a game where I prefer to have an authentic cartridge. My advice for collectors is to purchase a cheaper copy with *some* wear on the label.

As for the game itself, it's perfect. Guy, who was omitted from Final Fight 1 and Final Fight 2, is now finally a playable character, and it was worth the wait. He is the star of the game, and immense fun to play as. He has a ground-and-pound move, a dash-and-attack combo,a backthrow, flurry combination, fireball, and can even use nunchucks (eat your heart out, Michaelangelo). All the characters have breathing animations, and they all have a charge attack and a super attack. Also, female enemies are finally included.

How does Final Fight 3 stack up against it's two predecessors? With Final Fight 1, the player has to fight defensively to progress. With Final Fight 2, the player has a bit more freedom to play more aggressively. With Final Fight 3 though, the speed of the game has been upped substantially. The player has tremendous liberty in choosing how to deal with the hordes of enemies, giving the game tremendous replay value. Also, there are a few variables in the game that can allow the player to choose different paths. In my most recent playthrough, I was able to skip two bosses (Wong and Stray).

The backgrounds and character sprites are, as usual, beautiful. The game looks like a comic book come-to-life, and Metro City has beautiful orange sunsets, lush park landscapes, graffiti-smeared slums, and a really neat boat level where the background lists very nicely. The music is the best of the series, but still not up to par with Streets of Rage 2. The gameplay and graphics are so well done, that I stop and marvel at how great video games were in the 16 bit era before such a rough transition to the polygonal and choppy 32 and 64 bit era (PS1 and N64, respectively). When you play a game like Final Fight 3 on SNES, you can really see just how much quality and artistry was lost when the 16 bit era ended. I've opined before in my review for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles In Time that the game looked, felt, and played just like a classic coin-op beat 'em up should, but I think even the popular Turtles in Time is put to shame by Final Fight 3.

The other question to answer is how does this game stack up against the 3 Streets of Rage games on Sega? Console Wars already did their video where they matched all three games from each series head-to-head with Streets of Rage and Streets of Rage 2 besting Final Fight and Final Fight 2. I disagree with their conclusion that Streets of Rage 3 is better than Final Fight 3. Final Fight 3 is, quite simply, the Cadillac of beat em ups. Streets of Rage 3 feels choppy by comparison, everything is just running so smoothly on Final Fight 3. Streets of Rage 2 was my favorite childhood game, and I still consider it to be one of the best beat em ups, but even the great Streets of Rage 2 is inferior.

If the beat em up genre had to come to an end, I find it fitting that Final Fight 3 is the game to end the genre with an incredible bang. I look at all the great beat em ups from this era of video games....games such as Golden Axe, Knights of the Round, King of Dragons, Bad Dudes vs Dragon Ninja, Streets of Rage, X-Men, Simpsons, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Final Fight...and I'm glad that Final Fight was the flagship beat em up series. They gave us three great games, the best installment coming last. The series has great characters like Haggar, Cody, and Guy (not to mention how HOT Maki was), varied fighting styles, fighting around world landmarks, neat weapons, great levels, etc. There were many great beat em ups, but there was only one Final Fight series. The Final Fight series will always be the gold standard of beat em ups.",Guy Is Finally A Playable Character,1487376000,,,

The graphics/sound effects/music are better this time around (especially on the Iron Ruin level).  Not to mention it looks great on your television, compared to the Sega Game Gear itself.

There are 2 other ways to access this game:  unlock it from Sonic Adventure DX:  Director's Cut on the Nintendo GameCube or find it in the Sonic Gems Collection.  You will select the usual players:  Sonic, Tails, Amy and Dr. Eggman (a.k.a. Dr. Robotnik).  There's also the addition of 3 new players:  Knuckles the Echidna, Fang, and Metal Sonic.  And, you still get to use your special power-ups to smoke the competition:  Sonic/Metal Sonic can burst with some awesome nitro, Tails/Knuckles can jump, and Amy/Fang/Dr. Eggman can throw traps to slow down the other racers.

Two other important notes:  you will work through 18 unique tracks instead of just six.  Some of them are loop-de-loops while the rest have a more linear start/end goal.  Last but not least, if you continue to finish first in every race, you can collect Chaos Emeralds along the way which will unlock the FINAL Grand Prix mode.

The gameplay isn't ALL bad. I mean, you do get to have a gun, and you DO get to shoot in selectable directions (Except up or down). However, it's a platformer with the worst jumping control in an NES game. There are even some small tiles that you NEED to jump on to move on, but there's a big chance you can fall THROUGH them. Heck, you can even jump through other platforms, too. So you'll have a really hard time ever beating the first level. If you do manage to get past the first level, you'll be likely to give up.

The sounds are dull. The music is a garbled 8-Bit mess. The sound effects are okay, I guess. But it's cruel having to listen to 2 beats over and over again. At least, in the first level, that was what it was like.

The graphics are decent, but they could have improved the backgrounds to make them look more Terminator-y.

The game set the platform for all future Mega Man games to follow.  Simple things such as letting the player decide which route they wish to take through the game.  Having a simple functioning easy to use password to save your progress.  Being able to continue right outside the stage boss gate unlike Castlevania or Ninja Gaiden where you had to start from the middle of a stage instead of right at the level boss.  Along with the idea of subtanks to refill your life and help you overcome difficult sections of the game was a great idea.  Those are just 4 examples of game improvements, but they went a long way in making this a great game.  Of course what would Mega Man be without the ability to acquire all the boss weapons and use them to your advantage through the game and against the other bosses!

At the time following Atari most Nintendo games were games you had to play straight through with no password battery backup or save feature.  You had to beat an entire game in one sitting, whether that took you 20 minutes or 2 hours.  So right off the bat the replay value for the Mega Man series was off the charts all thanks to the layout and design of Mega Man 2.  That is not to mention the awesome rock music that kept the atmosphere exciting and fun.

The box cover art looked kind of dull until Mega Man 3 came out we didn't get the true essence of the look of the Blue Bomber and all his glory.  The first game looked like a Tron clone.  The Mega Man 2 cover art was improved but not all the way there yet.

Most people remember the energy beams from the Quick Man stage.  I always remember the big robot fish and the spikes in the Dr. Wily stages along with the jumping platforms on Airmans stage.  The game had a really cool ending as well.  This game is classic and has aged very well.  Overall it is an easy game to rate 5 stars, one of the best games on the NES console.  This is a great collector item game and can now be enjoyed on the NES classic console.

Other reviewers complained about the interface, but at least for me, I thought the interface was pretty good.  Perhaps it helps that I have S-Video and a relatively large screen, but I thought the interface was easy to use.  Maybe not as fast as a mouse could be, but I can't lie down on a couch and use my mouse.
My definite problem with this game is that the Dreamcast will start running out of memory with the more trains and stations you add.  I find myself purposefully limiting how much I build.  Otherwise the cursor & interface starts moving slower and slower.  Worst of all, half the time, the game eventually freezes before I can beat the level!  It isn't easy to get a gold, so when the game crashes right before you finish a level, it's intensely irritating.  It takes time to save, so saving every couple minutes isn't really an option.
I'd much rather play a console game than a computer game, so I still enjoy Railroad Tycoon for the Dreamcast very much.  But, unless you can accept that it crashes, it's better to spend the same amount of money and get the computer version of Railroad Tycoon...which comes with more levels and (I'd presume) a better manual.

True, it did have some good ideas, but they were all so poorly executed! And don't tell me ""Oh! But this one has a 4 player mode!"". Who cares? That doesn't make it good.

Carmageddon has always been about running amuck on city streets, in construction zones, and through mountain communities, running over cows and men and grannies with stretchers, and pulverizing your opponents.  Carmageddon is all about racing, ""challenging"" missions, and frustration.  If you try to play the game as it is apparently designed to be played, you cannot possibly have any fun.  You start out with a limited time and have to struggle to add any bonus time before your experience is aborted way too early.  The map feature, which was quite good in Carmageddon 2, is cartoonish and aggravating.  The powerups and surprise bonuses along the way aren't very impressive or extensive (although the designers unfortunately felt compelled to leave the silly Bouncy Bouncy feature in the game).  The racing environments are nowhere near as extensive as I was used to, which is a further criticism I have of this game.  The only new touch I really liked is the tendency of pedestrians to jump around on one leg after you put the other one out of commission; overall, though, running over pedestrians here is just not as much fun as it should be.
The fatal flaw here is the emphasis on objective missions.  It takes so long to figure out the challenge race and somehow miraculously complete it that your disgust with the whole business overweighs any excitement you may have about finally getting a chance to race on a new track.  It is hard enough to figure out what you are supposed to do, let alone do it in the minimal time allotted.  Once you think you have it, another extra requirement pops up to dash your hopes; if you could save a race or challenge during the action, it would do much to help alleviate the problem.  This game really betrays the wonderfully fun Carmageddon tradition and makes this a game quite unable to offer enough positives to outweigh the many negatives.  The result is the death of a great gaming series.",The horrible death of a previously outstanding series,1040515200,8,,
4,False,"10 26, 2010",A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B000056PJE,Raisuli the Magnificent,"And by the title I mean the Dark Forces series.  This game was a much anticipated gem back in the mid 90s.  Many of us had gotten weary of the many DOOM addons in circulation via some of the now very antiquated websites.  Some DOOM addon authors went ahead and created ""Star Wars DOOM""; essentially the DOOM game with Star Wars graphics and sprites added to replace the demons from hell running amuck on Mars and Earth.  But, like all user efforts, it wasn't truly completed until years and years later, and even then it seemed mediocre like a lot of user efforts.

Then one day at Fry's I see what has to be a mirage; I see something like DOOM running on a PC, only with the very cool trappings of Star Wars.  It was of course the Dark Forces demo running on a then very state of the art pentium.  Like all good sci-fi and Star Wars' fans, I was hooked.  I played the demo again and again and again, and pre-ordered the game from the old Lucasgames catalog.

Like the official reviews have stated Dark Forces is a great triumph, but is held back from being a truly spectacular game for the time.  First off there was no in game save.  If you died, you had to start from a way point.  If you lost off of your lives, then you had to restart the map.

The story tells of a new Imperial weapon meant to bring the Rebel Alliance to its knees, and you play Kyle Katarn, gun for hire, to investigate and bring an end to this new threat.  The level design ranges from outstanding to so-so.  Simply put some of the maps are very interesting while repetitive, while others are rather plain.  All in all the design is linear, unlike the DOOM maps.

One of the real highlights of this game were the sound effects and general Star Wars space opera flavor.  But even that only carries so far for a game whose structure is limited to about a dozen or so different missions.  To counter that are all the user made addon levels created for the game.  The old America Online Dark Forces community is probably long since gone, but they pioneered creating new maps for this game.  Most of which are preserved at DF-21.net.

The addon levels added a whole new dimension to the game, and expanded the basic game play by leaps and bounds.  Terrific and innovative architecture and story telling, as well as new models and textures were found in these addon maps.  So, once you were done with the basic game, you could go and see what other Dark Forces' fans had made, down load the maps, and continue your experience.  There were some real gems too, 90% of which were made by single authors.  Some are multilevel stories made by a group of four or five designers teaming up for an effort, but the supermajority of addons for this game were done by individuals.

My other critique of the game is that some of the maps themselves seemed to be somewhat limiting in terms of atmosphere.  An example is the Nar Shadaa map.  Where new textures to create buildings would have been helpful, instead what we get are crates stacked up on top of one another to emulate a ""down town"" feel for a section of the map.

All in all it was a very fun game to play at the time, though by today's standards it's rather dated.  An interesting effort happened a few years back, where some of the authors of addon maps for the latest Star Wars games took some of the Dark Forces levels and remade them with modern graphics for the Jedi Outcast series.  If you're a true Star Wars gamer, then it may be worth your time to check out both this game and some of the addons I mentioned in this review.

Floigan Bros. was announced way back in the day - one of the original announced titles for the DC. It's been in development hell for *years*, and it suffers from a few serious gameplay issues, but more damningly, a complete lack of focus.
The game plot itself is relatively simple. You play as Hoigle Floigan, and your dopey brother Moigle tags along. Moigle is amusing in a very mentally-retarded or idiot-savant kind of way, if you find that sort of thing funny. If you don't, it's probably borderline offensive. Moigle's stupid, Hoigle's too short and weak to be useful.
Moigle needs seven parts to create his little seekrit project, and to get them, he's going to need Hoigle's help. The Brothers own a junkyard, and to screw things up even further, there's an evil guy who wants control of the junkyard, so he throws his cat henchmen down from his blimp to take over. There's no visible motivation for *why* this Baron Malodorous fellow wants the junkyard, he just does. Why are his minions cats? They just are.
""It just *is*,"" might as well be a slogan for this game. Things are arbitrary in a way that's really... bizarre. First of all, you'd think, when you're first shown the seven parts that you need (things like a chimney stack, an engine, a fan, etc.) that these are common things to find in a junkyard. So context-relevant puzzles would seem to make sense. No such luck. You find a fan by blowing up a cat, and you find the chimney stack by having a huge plant barf it up for you. Completely incoherent, illogical solutions to puzzles do not a fun game make. Why is the chimney stack there? It just *is*.
The whole game so far is like this. The design of the gameplay is simply no fun, the AI for the characters is entertaining for about five minutes, the voice samples get old quick, and the game itself, while pretty, is like talking to the Mona Lisa. It may look good, but it's not saying much.

The background graphics (especially the first level) truly showcase the graphical power of the GBA. That, and the music is cheesy, 8-bit-sounding fun. I love shooters akin to R-Type, Gradius, Iridion 2 (which I oddly played prior to this one), but Iridon 3-D truly falls shot due to its unforgiving difficulty and poor hit detection.

Enemies take WAY too many hits to kill (if you can manage to at all) and none of the weapon upgrades do anything (at least I couldn't find any difference between them other than the way they looked) to improve your ship and the bosses are another issue altogether. Most of them require you to hit a weak point. The problem? The only way to hit said weak point is position your ship directly in front of oncoming fire. Thus, you're taking the same amount of damage you're dealing. And no, there are no saves. You acquire a password after each beaten level, however, you start with the same lives you had at the time of that password acquisition. So if you beat the second level with one life to spare, thats all you get for the rest of the game. Good luck.

Its also difficult to dodge oncoming fire because of how tiny the enemy blasts are and due to the fact that the hit detection is just terrible. Even when you think youve dodged something you havent. Worse is that theres simply too much going on in some levels to even decipher between environment, enemy, or both (the comet level is the worst).

The only fun encounter I had was the final boss fight that actually requires attention to movement and dodging (practically everything else just fills the screen with blasts).

5,False,"07 31, 2002",A4NRFON6WHWNW,B00005NZ1Q,Amazon Customer,"My appologies to the creative people at EA Sports, who make this game, after my previous review. I had only one major criticism, but after doing some checking, I found I was wrong.
I initially thought that I could only play in Pro mode (invariably winning every game by 5-10 touchdowns), or lose every time in any higher mode than Pro.
This game is so sophisticated, I found I was able to change the game play to all-pro, and turn up the overall performance of my own players a notch, and turn down the CPU's performance a notch. In doing this, I finally am playing like I have in all previous versions of Madden: I have a pretty descent chance of winning any individual game, but it is always a dog-fight, and usually, if I win, it is by using alot of strategy. This is again the great football game (much better now on the x-box) I am used to.
This game is so sophisticated it blows my mind. With the franchise mode, I can be general manager as well as any player and coach on the team. Game play is realistic- on the TV it looks and plays very much like watching a real broadcast of an NFL game.
John Madden is always fun to hear. No one can question he is the best commentator in video games (as well as real NFL games). Pat Summerall is a very good play by play addition.
Strong points:
1. Great, and exciting game play. Very realistic. Keeps you at the edge of your seat all game (and every game).
2. Great commentary (John Madden- what else has to be said).
3. Many diverse modes to play in: Franchise, quick games, you can even simply choose to play in the play-offs.
4. Great practice mode for learning how to run specific routes and plays. John Madden walks you through it while you practice.
5. Great tips by John Madden anytime during a game- though it does not automatically mean you will score by using a recommended strategy.
6. I have heard that the upcoming release Madden 2003 will be even better- but if you can get this game at amazon or wherever for [price], new or used, for the x-box, I would not wait for the 2003 edition. It is a true bargain. You will never tire of this game.
Cons:
1. I miss being able to play historically great teams of the past (as in Madden 1999- which I still keep on windows 98)- like the 1981 49ers against Dallas in the NFC Finals, or the Great Raider teams of the past against Pittsburg.
2. The commentary is helpful and fun to listen to, as well as being very comprehensive, but once in a while the commentary has nothing to do with a play that just occured. For example, ""If he keeps playing this well, he will have a career day"", right after gaining 1 yard on 4th and goal on the 10 yard line. I admit I have never played any sports game where the commentary is 100% accurate to what is going on currently in the game, but sometimes the misplaced commentary in Madden 2002 makes me laugh.
3. Music?  The only song played is this omnipresent rap song called ""Pharaoh Madden"", and goes something like ""Puttin a woopin on your naural""........
Besides these trivial Cons, this game loads the most bang for your buck than any of its genre. I would buy it all over again, even for [price].",Revision to my previous review- I was wrong.,1028073600,,,

The characters have their own unique personalities and make their own decisions throughout the course of the game, which is rare in a lot of RPGs. I can appreciate the monotony of the turn-based battles as a break from always having to have quick reflexes in their action-RPG counterparts. There are also a large variety of spells that your character can learn, especially if you change the character's class to cleric and other such classes. You can also have a more powerful warrior if he is under the ""warrior"" or ""fighter"" class. There is no other RPG that replicates the medieval beauty such as this one that I have found; I can only find those kinds of RPGs on the SNES or NES.

The Bad: Visuals can give you a headache, not enough songs, can get extremely hard later on

Before Guitar Hero and Rock Band, Harmonix created this fun rhythm game using pop, hip-hop, industrial rock, and other genres. You tap away on your controller with a ""pick your own path"" type of gameplay. The game is fun and very challenging, and comes with some great tools.

You use the square, circle, and triangle buttons to tap away on a track. Use the D-pad to rotate the tube and pick any track you want to play. You will know when you have to play when you see a green line connecting dots. This gives you a break between sections so you can rest your thumb for a second. Tracks range from the vocals, synth, bass, drums, guitar, and other instruments. When you successfully complete a section that instrument will continue playing. Score perfectly in that section of the song and the instruments won't turn off when you enter the next gate. I found this a little annoying, but it encourages you to play perfectly the song doesn't stop. You are scored, as usual, and a meter is shown on how bad or well you are doing. Fail too much and you will fail the song.

That's the entire game in a nutshell. It seems simple, and it is, but the game is challenging later on when you have to do longer sections and faster button presses. There's some pretty good music here by Powerman 5000, No Doubt, Fear Factory, and others popular musicians. The visuals are trippy and can give you a headache after a while. They are psychedelic and full of bright colors and fractal shapes. One thing I found useless was the free scratch mode which lets you press one of the three buttons while moving the left stick back and forth to scratch. This isn't there for anything but for fun I guess.

Once you beat the main game on each difficulty you can go into Remix mode which plays a song while you add your own notes to the song. This can be pretty fun for people who want to change-up the game themselves. However, I did find that there should have been more songs, but I guess remix mode is supposed to remedy that. There's a good dozen hours of gameplay here and you will keep coming back to master the game.

For just a couple of dollars Frequency is one of the most fun I have had in a rhythm game since Rock Band 2. I found myself coming back and trying to master the songs. The music may not be to everyone's taste, but if you open your mind you will find a gem of a game here.",Tons of fun. Just really hard,1347494400,,,

I personally think this was a great game.  It is challenging from the beginning and continually becomes more challenging.  I judge a game by how many times I curse at it.  I cursed a lot trying to master the moves and you must account for the fact that your team mate is not as good as the AI for the other team.

The mini games are a nice touch to get your skills up and trying to get new characters keeps you wanting to play on.  I think this is a great game and I may be partial because I loved Outlaw Golf as well.  I think it is a great game that focuses alot more on volleyball than DOA did.  In fact after learning the basics of DOA you could just look at the actual gameplay as a needless show to get more items.

(Gamer &amp; PC/Android indie dev),"Believe it or not, Mario is no stranger to pinball tables, but there has never been a pinball video game starring the plucky plumber. Well, the good news is that there was a development team that realized this, and has put this out for the good ol' Game Boy Advance. Unfortunately, the team might have been too small to work with such a big Nintendo property. While Mario Pinball Land/Super Mario Ball does hold a lot of promise, the problems are few yet incredibly major.

The game mashes up the pinball style of play with a Super Mario 64 structure; collect Power Stars by slinging Mario as a ball into enemies and grabbing keys by defeating bosses. On paper, the concept is really good. However, here's the major flaw: Navigation. In order to get anywhere, you must use the flippers to fling Mario to doors and paths, which is EASIER SAID THAN DONE. It's not like in any Mario platformer where you can just move him with the analog stick to that door. Oh, no. Here, you have to hope Mario rolls down to the direction the door's located! There are numerous instances where Mario would hit the door open, but then constantly miss the opened path. Or maybe Mario would hit something else by accident and trigger more frustration. He could hit paths that I don't want to go to. And this problem is worsened during missions where you must hit enemies in specific ways (such as hitting snakes before they go the manhole in the middle, or hitting Shy Guys to change their color - all Shy Guys onscreen must be the same color)! Heck, maybe the problem wouldn't be as jarringly apparent if the pinball physics were completely accurate. But they aren't; they are surprisingly unreliable for a Nintendo-published game.

It's not like no one made an effort to make this game good, though. There is a lot of positive weight to this, too; the music is appropriately catchy and has the typical repetitions of a Mario soundtrack, and the graphics are actually some of the best the Game Boy Advance has to offer. The pinball mechanics also do have their merits, since it IS, well, pinball, and you could even use a few items to help a little. It's just a big shame the physics haven't been tweaked up enough and navigation isn't any easier. The bosses justify this even further, especially Bowser. You just had to hit them a few times and they're dead, but Mario's bound not to hit them when you need him to.",Mario's unstable pinball expedition,1422748800,,,

If you like First Person Shooters, you will like this game. When I was playing it, I was reminded of my old ""Doom"" days - and all that fun.

One negative: the game crashed 4 time for me on XP. I found this usually happened when the ""bio-shield"" is selected on you special enhancement category indicator.

This game is all about tactics and its correct execution.  It actually reminds me of the Close Combat Series in the PC (a top-view RTS game where you command World War 2 squads via mouse-pointing and setting their behavior).  Because of technolgical advancement, we now have a 3D Close Combat game in the form of Full Spectrum warrior.

Like close combat, the goal of the game is proper positioning.  What makes the game more challenging is keeping your men alive.  Once someone dies, the game is over.  The controls may not be intuitive at first, especially when you're used to First Person Shooters.  But there are actually 5 training missions where you can practice them.  Think of it as controlling the game with a mouse -- with the X Button acting as the Left Mouse Button. I think this will help a lot in understanding the controls.  My only gripe about the controls is that the cursor does not pass through obstacles which makes commanding a pain sometimes.

The game mechanics are great as it forces you to THINK of ways to outflank the enemy while under fire without losing any of your troops.  Brute force does not work in this game, as even one enemy can withstand the full firepower of your squad as long as he is entrenched properly.  And charging head-on without suppression fire or smoke is suicide.

Graphics is so-so.  Although I think that Pandemic's Star Wars Battlefront for the PS2 had great graphics, this game falls short.  The backgroud is kind of bland and flat most of the time.  I guess they have to compromise between map size (maps in the game are large) and detail because of the PS2's limitation.  Troop rendering is good enough, but not as elaborate as SOCOM or Borthers In Arms.

Sound is also average.  Gunshots don't sound as convincing as Brother In Arms.  Although you can hear some of your troops wise-cracking once in a while, you'll sometimes get annoyed as they also do it at the same time you are recieving a radio message from HQ.  This makes it difficult for you to understand the HQ message.

Conclusion:

Gameplay-wise, I guess this game is a treat for the wargamers.

Gaphics-wise, it's good enough, but I've seen better.

Sound-wise, same as above. I've seen better.

Again, I'd only recommend this game for hardcore wargamers who does't care about graphics and First Person Shooters.

For those who wants a great First Person Shooter with squad tactics and great graphics, you'd be better off picking up SOCOM.  I'd also recommend Brothers In Arms (which I think is the best among the lot) but the game is not for everyone as well.",This is a War / Stratetgy Game...

In this game you have a team of 5 mechs and you can use any of them to fight your battles. You can change the color of the pain as you please as well which I loved. There are also drones that you can use as weapons that fly around and chase your enemy (this was really cool). There is a variety of things here. You can make heavy armored AC'S who are slow but powerful or lightweight ones who tend to evade well but lack power. I tend to move more towards power since if you fight against one with no good defense specs you need only a couple of shots and he's gone. The different settings of the game are cool since there is a good number of them and they will affect how you assemble your AC. BTW the graphics on this game are REALLY GOOD. The only thing I wish it had was a story and that it was longer. There are only 2 leagues and after you finish them you only keep fighting the same opponents. They do modify their AC'S but there is no sense of achievement anymore.

In the emperors name! Purchase this now! If you enjoyed Starcraft/Warcraft, then you will enjoy this game, if not more.

The nitty-gritty:

This is an old game but it is still amazing to play. I remember bumping into this game by accident. At first I thought it was just some knock off from Starcraft, but little did I know that it was the other way around Death to the false emperor! I can rant about Warhammer for days on end, but I will make this review based off the game.

The Warhammer universe is by the far one of the most dynamic, gruesome, rich and well established fantasies that one can imagine. The story is set in the 41st millennium where in the grim darkness of the far future there is only war. You have the loyal forces of the imperium at war with xenos which included the orks (green skins), Eldar, and other creatures. But not all are loyal, as the forces of Chaos also lay waste to all around. This is the first game of various expansions and the prelude to what is Dawn of War 2.

The story consists of force commander Gabriel Angelos, captain of the blood ravens. You arrive on Tartarus to aid the imperial guard as the loyal forces are over run by a green tide of orks. As the story progesses, the campaign looks grim and the future uncertain. Without going into details, the ork forces are discovered to be driven by a mobilization far too efficient and cunning to be of an ork mind, as you wage war, other developments arise.

SPOILERS

Do not read below if you care about the story

This game hits home for me, its just too amazing to pass up. Just in verbal audio and cut scenes you are looking at a good 1+ hour of content. Little did I know that the Warhammer universe was so massive, and that this video game was one of many and that everything was based on a series of books and a table top game. The story takes you through the landing on planet tartarus and commanding the forces of the blood ravens. As the story progresses, you begin to see that Gabriel Angelos is suspect due to the recent actions he has taken on his home world Cyrene. He is troubled as he has called upon the Inquisition for an Exterminatus, a full destruction of his planet due to Heresy or acts against the imperium of man. The solution? To cleanse the entire planet.

We learn this through his companion, a psyker known as Isador who is Gabriel Agelos battle brother. Due to the actions taken, this brings Inquistor Mordecai Toth to place a watchful eye on Gabriel as he suspects that he might be tainted by Chaos. During the attacks from the orks, they begin to find traces that the orks are being urged or manipulated by some unknown force or higher intelligence. During one of the campaigns they find chaos temples/altars and worship to the dark gods. Suddenly, the sector is about to be plagued by warp storms. Gabriel is left with a choice, evacuate the sector within 3x days or stay and be stranded for an unknown amount of time to defend the doomed world Tartarus while it is under attack by Ork and Chaos forces. To add even more danger, they are attacked by the enigmatic Eldar, what brings them to this doomed world? What other secrets are hidden within Tartarus?

Are you interested yet? If not, you should be that is just up to Mission 4 out of 11 (if memory serves me well). The story is just incredible and continues to expand. The gameplay is rich with many unique units and structures to build. The death and destruction is absolute, with vast armies prepared to die in the name of their beliefs or for the hunt of the fight. The story alone is worth every moment, and the gameplay for local LAN or online gameplay up to 8x players is incredible. I remember spending hours and hours playing skirmish battles with all of the AI difficulty being on insane and dragging battles out for hours on end, with non stop attacks on my fortresses and troops. It got to the point where a friend of mine was also addicted to the game that we used to play locally via LAN against the AI, instead we would place all AI opponents on insane against us while we tried to survive the attacks long enough to have a small chance to strike back.

The expansions alone are also incredible, which extends the awesome game play, characters, units and so on. Stop reading, go out and buy it and also look into the Warhammer universe, it is just incredible. To date, this has to be the best series I have ever encountered, it blows away all other books, characters and games that I have played, its just too rich. Who would have thought that a simple game would get me addicted to the entire universe, only to have me keep reading and playing more games over the years to come. In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.

I will review all the other expansions as I go along. This is the game of the year edition, but to save on cost you can get the gold or platinum editions or just check out Steam. The story is just epic, reminds me of Legacy of Kain, thats how good these stories are. Thank you blessed warp storms.

4,True,"04 8, 2016",A3PRDWD3JMF485,B000B9TUWY,Triforce Of Power,"Final Fight. Can I be forgiven for spending a minute gushing about the greatness of Final Fight?

When I stop and think about the original arcade game, it just blows my mind. Double Dragon and Bad Dudes were decent looking arcades, but Final Fight took it to the next level. The beautifully rendered Metro City (which has NYC's landmarks) is a perfect backdrop for this game. The colors are bright, the music is decent, and the action is non-stop. The three greatest elements of the game are the Capcom visual presentation, the NYC-style setting, and most importantly the representation of varied fighting styles. Haggar is the big American wrestler, Cody is the American kickboxer style fighter, and Guy is the Eastern-style martial artist. The look and attire appropriately matches the character's fighting style. It's absolutely brilliant.

The SNES port I just received has the obvious flaws of missing the industrial stage, no 2-player, no blood, replacing female (and/or transsexual) sprites Roxy and Poison with Sid and Billy, and worst of all...NO GUY. The lack of a stage sucks, and the blood was a really neat touch in the arcade version. I can get over Roxy and Poison being replaced, but it's a shame since Roxy and Poison are very interesting looking...they look like a punky cross between Debbie Gibson and Cindy Lauper, and I find them visually interesting. It's a shame they got cut, and the online controversy will continue to rage over whether or not Poison was a female or shemale.

BUT NO GUY. Out of the three unique looking characters, the most eastern-looking character in a karate outfit was cut. This is completely unacceptable, because so much of the appeal of the game is wrapped up in the idea of blending street fighting and karate to punish punks in NYC. Without Guy, it might as well be Axel Blaze and Max Thunder. Imagine if one of the Street Fighter II games didn't have Ryu and it's the same thing. The SNES Guy Edition cartridge is rare and too expensive, and still has all the same problems plus NO CODY. It's a lose-lose situation.

I'm tempted to think that Capcom thought that Axel Blaze was copying Cody's look (jeans, white shirt, Converse All-Stars), so Cody was scrapped from Final Fight 2 and 3. I know most gamers consider 2 to be the best, but I can't get over how badly the series was messed up because of the radically different cast. Cody and Guy were left out of Final Fight 2 and replaced with Maki (a Chun-Li clone) and a ninja named Carlos. Carlos is the most un-ninja name I've ever heard, and he really should have been given a cowl or something to complete the look. I am impressed by the game taking place in major cities all over the world, but why Cody and Guy were shafted is a mystery. Final Fight 3, like Streets of Rage 3, is the tired afterthought of the series with a few new additions, but the curtain call as 16-bit beat 'em ups died so tournament fighting games (like Street Fighter 2) could live. In Final Fight 3, at least they finally added Guy. Lucia, the female character, is my personal favorite hottest 16 bit babe. But then there's a nobody named Dean. Who the hell is Dean? WHERE IS CODY????

In summation, Final Fight was one of the greatest beat 'em  arcades, second only to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but never got it right on the Super Nintendo. From a doomed port of the first game to an unrectified Blockbuster exclusive to two sequels that never got it right. It's almost no wonder why Streets of Rage 2 is considered the best entry between the two series. I guess Capcom was more interested in getting the Megaman X series games right, and sure enough soon after Resident Evil became Capcom's never favorite flagship franchise.",Capcom's Flagship Beat 'Em Up Franchise Is A Bungled Gem,1460073600,,,

4,False,"05 13, 2006",A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000CC5C8Q,Lisa Shea,"Beatmania bills itself as a DJ music mixing game. Really it's a lot like Guitar Hero, but instead of a guitar you have a short keyboard that makes either keyboard or drum noises.

 I in fact play keyboards, so I was very interested in seeing how this plays. There are only 4 white keys and 3 black keys, plus a ""turntable"" to spin. The keys were easy to play and in only a few minutes I was hitting 200-in-a-row on songs I'd never heard before. This was a quick glimpse into the long term benefits and problems that I found as I continued to play this game.

On the good side this IS like a piano. This means that, unlike with Guitar Hero, you actually gain ""real life skills"" by playing this game! Your ability to quickly hit the various keys is really good training for actual piano playing. Sure, you're not playing real notes on a staff. Still, being able to hit 2 keys at once, or to move quickly between keys, is quite important.

The game really is enjoyable when you get into a groove, playing along with the song and hitting all the notes. Depending on the song, you are playing piano, keyboards, drums, cymbals and other instruments. It's a lot of fun.

On the bad side, I really wonder who chose the song list for this game! I think I recognized 3 of the songs. There was little real variety. I own a ton of karaoke, drumming and other ""music"" style games. I really love this genre. The song list in this game is probably the worst I have ever seen in any of them. It's not just that I didn't know the songs - it's that many of them were really bad songs. I went through them to get to the top rating - but they weren't songs I enjoyed playing along with in some cases.

The turntable controller is really iffy. While the keys were very responsive and had a good ""finger feel"", the turntable was VERY sticky and often would not turn well. It's frustrating to be playing along perfectly, then to break your chain because the turntable is stuck (again).

Which brings up another issue I had - gameplay flow. There are a LOT of aspects of gameplay which were just really poor in this console version. I realize the game is adapted from arcade games. Still, it doesn't mean we have to suffer with the BAD aspects of arcade gameplay as a result! For example, you play through 3 songs - and then you are DONE. No more songs. With other games, I get rewarded! I can keep playing! Here, it barely even says ""good job"" before it goes into an 8-minute-long credit run. OK, you can skip them, but the point is that the game should keep going if you are doing well. It shouldn't end after only 3 songs and make you restart from the very beginning.

The game is very harsh about scoring. If you get a chain, you're usually OK. If you miss just one note, perhaps because of a sticky turntable, then your points plummet.

In one of the most inane design elements ever, when you get your praise about doing ""perfect"" on a note - those words show up OVER THE INCOMING NOTES. Who thought that up?? Show them off to the side somewhere - not covering up the notes you are trying to play.

There are little videos to the top right while you are playing the songs, but since you're paying attention to the incoming note markers, you never get to see them. You could only watch them if you had a friend who was good enough to make it through the song for you. I would much rather see little happy audience members, a la the karaoke games, that cheered you on. That would be much more enjoyable than a video that I can't watch.

The sound is rather good, which you would hope from a game that focusses on music. That is - you hear the instruments quite clearly. As commented before, the actual song mix is another story.

I'm torn on this game. It is a great concept but there are some real flaws here with how it was implemented. I really want to get the NEXT version of this game when they fix all of these issues. However, if enough of us don't buy this current version, they won't make a next version :) So I would say to go ahead and buy this if you enjoy music / keyboard games, if only because it really does build up your keyboarding skills. Then we can all write the makers and ensure that they do a better job on their next version. At that point we'll have the player unit and will only have to buy the new software.",Great Potential but Several Problems,1147478400,12,,

Not only do you get to break the law, but you get to do it in style. (And all in the name of peace, of course)

 From a first glance, the opening level takes us to what seems to be the normal first person shooter. You get an arsenal of two weapons (which have laser aiming) and you are thrown right in. The game is mostly straightforward - there aren't any gadgets or other devices many modern first person shooters employ. You are just a normal cop, who has a little leeway over the drug dealers (and barons) of crime ridden Miami.

 Which brings us to an innovative menu system which is seen right after the first level. Unlike the normal level after level transition, you get to scour the city, doing various things in order to improve reputation, make cash, upgrade\purchase weapons, or to find about the next mission.

 This is where Miami Vice departs from the norm. In sixteen days (which translates into sixteen business `deals') you have to accomplish those off-mission tasks just mentioned. The buying and selling of drugs can be used to make money, but of course, spending it wisely is far more important. There are also ""hacking"" mini-games, which are an absolute waste of time, and provide frustrating interludes from the great action and pace of the single player.

 The game-play is very easy to understand and learn. There isn't a lot of ""oh-that's what that does"" stuff. The graphics are good - even superb, but probably not exceptional. The game is well formed, but is far too short for to be purchased. There is little to not replay value in Miami Vice (save for starting over and switching characters). There are not really any control issues - although this is interesting, since there aren't any camera controls either.

 I highly recommend this game to anyone who would like to play a great game over a weekend.

GRAPHICS: 9/10 (Wonderful graphics, but characters' overlays are used over and over)

SOUND: 6/10 (Guns sound fairly powerful, soundtrack is so-so. Enemies say the same things over and over again.)

CONTROLS: 9/10 (I liked the freedom the controls brought to the PSP. Free aim is a lot more fun, ducking and crouching allows for reloads no-problem.)

DIFFICULTY: 4/10 (The game is naturally easy, but the various upgrades to weapons, armor, hints about each level, and easy cash from drug dealers makes it far easier.)

LOAD TIMES: LOW (Very decent load times.)

Guess until you get it right and then move on. This is my pet peeve with all video games. When they rely on giving you unlimited continues and turn it into a guessing game, that is less about skill and more about luck, it completely drains engagement from the experience, leaving you with no depth, no suspension of disbelief, and certainly no suspense. You go from tension to repetition and repetition kills tension. You get the feeling that you've done this before, because you just have, a dozen times over to finally move on. You're just struggling to give it the one and only solution, in the one and only way that it will accept as correct to get to the next cut scene.

Xyanide's a sidescrolling shooter in which you're charged with the task of trying to prevent to a substance (Xyanide, which can transform thoughts into reality) from being dispersed into the planet by an evil witch by the name of Aguira, of whom was sent to be exiled.  The control scheme in Xyanide is a tad different from other sidescrolling shooters.  You primary shoot by holding the right thumbstick, and secondary fire using the left trigger.  While the controls can be altered, the basis of them is still the same (analog for primary, L or R for secondary).

The graphics are exceptional for a current gen shooter and the colors (along with the stages) are live and vibrant all throughout the huge areas of the game.  You even have the opportunity to take various routes within areas in hopes of trying to immune yourself from massive danger.  The only real problem is that at times it can be a hassle locating your ship on the screen given that there is some much going on onscreen at once (paritcularly when enshrouded with a swarm of enemy ships about the same size as yours).  It does however help that your ship is highlighted in green.  Xyanide especially shows off it's best within stages that parrallel from one area to the next (though those with 3d motion sickness may want to be aware). The cutscene sequences are all very well composed and help accompany the storyline to the fast paced action.

As you play through the game, you'll acquire all sorts of different power-ups and specials for your ship (which is one of Xyanides main strong points, the effects in which the specials & power-ups have).  Some of these power-ups can range from Energy shields, Slomo (which slows everything onscreen), invulnerability, and stealth.  With specials, you have a bustle to choose from such as; Lighting Storm, Freeze, Nuke, Fire Storm, and drones.  What's truly unique about specials is that you can level them up to unleash even more of a devastating effect on the enemies.

All in all, Xyanide's an exceptional shooter.  Albeit there may not be enough here to satisfy the casual gamer (need I mention the game can be played with two players?), those looking for a classical shooter symbolic to those of the 80s and 90s, will definitely want to give Xyanide a look.  Infusing the elements of 2d and 3d, Xyanide offers enough to distinquish itself from the current titles out, while remaining genuine to the genre. All for a low retail price.  If this keeps up, gamers may just very well have a new shooting franchise on their hands.","Symbolic to the oldschool shooters of the 80s, but with a new twist",1159920000,,,

I really liked the art style, and from what I did play of this game some of it was interesting and/or funny, but I really didn't like the gameplay or most of the music.  The way you actually play (which is a bit hard to explain) is that there are colored in circles with numbers on them.  There are circles that go in towards the colored in circle and you have to tap the inner circle with the stylus with the outer circle hits it.  There are numbers on the circles and you have to tap them in order as the circles hit them.  Other times there may be a circle you have to hit at that time, but slide the stylus along the ball towards the end, and sometimes back again.  Other times you may have to hit the same circle twice if it has two circle lines going in towards it.  At the end of the level you have a circular disc that you have to spin around with the stylus.  The story and what's happening is on the top screen, while the agents dancing are on the bottom screen.  So, during play you don't really get to see what's happening on the top screen when you're playing because you have to pay attention to what you have to do, but before you start the next part you can look up and see whether you did well or not based on what happens and the circle that appears at the end saying you passed.  I remember that there are three sections of the song and story and you have to pass at least two to have beat the level.  Each part starts out with a comic book scene that you can choose to skip, but it's pretty slow and you can't really speed it up.

At the start there is a choice of what level to play it as, starting from easy.  I started with the next level above easy, but then had to go down to easy because the gameplay was just too hard.  After I started out on easy it wasn't too bad for a while, but it progressively got harder to the point where I was having difficulty keeping up or doing the right thing, so it's definitely a challenge to hit the right thing at the right time or slide the stylus along the balls, etc.  Sometimes it goes very fast.

As for the music, there were a few songs that I did like and it wasn't too bad playing during those songs, but for the other ones they were just really irritating and grating.  It seemed harder and more like a chore to get through.

A frustrating, yet satisfying masterpiece.  A game that *truly* makes you feel good when you finally complete a tough level.

The idea is simple, but the execution INSANELY hard.  Upon arriving to a room, look for the key (usually out in the open for you to see right away).  You have to make platform blocks with your wand to reach the key and then walk through the exit door (the exit door could be anywhere in the room, which is another challenge just to get to).  You can usually see the key and exit door out in the open right away.  However the game isn't *that* easy.  No way man!  If simply making blocks/building platforms to the key and the exit door was that simple, I'd have put the game down right away.  Such a simple concept would make it a children's game almost.

Nope!  These rooms are loaded with all kinds of enemies.  Dragons, fireball spitting gargoyles, floating ghosts, electrical sparks, dwarfs, rotating demon heads, orange rats, spinning skeleton heads, pigs, blue fire, red fire (the difference between the two fires is clever), marching wizards, flying red mice and more.  These enemies are placed in such a way that you can tell careful consideration was put into designing these levels.  You have to REALLY put on your thinking cap and find ways to block in, kill or jump over enemies that like to interfere with your ability to cleanly reach the key or exit door.

For example in one level, those electrical sparks spin around platforms.  You have to use your wand and your platform-making skills to block the sparks away in the corner, allowing the other areas of the room to become either accessible or easier to explore.  That's just one example.  There's 50 levels (or rooms) and each one has their own unique design making obtaining the key and reaching the exit door very difficult in its own way.  It's an incredible challenge really, every single room, and one that really tests your thinking abilities.  The game's honestly hard right from the beginning.

All kinds of collectibles are available as well.  It's actually quite confusing to understand the purpose behind them all, but basically if you collect 10 fairies you'll get an extra life.  And trust me you'll *want* those extra lives!  You'll want as many lives as you can get.  It's possible to get over 20 lives total, but I'll never be able to collect that many personally.  Starting off with just 3 lives, and then realizing Solomon's Key is the kind of game that will make you drain lives like crazy since you can easily die in just one hit or one mistake seems like a REALLY dirty trick.

I'm not a big fan of using Game Genie cheats, but in this case I would actually recommend using the Game Genie codes that enable you to start from certain rooms.  There's a series of Game Genie codes you can find on the internet that allow you to start from any room you want.  Avoid any of the invincibility codes if you see those however.  Using invincibility defeats the feeling of satisfaction completing these levels.

But yeah, there's other collectibles, such as Seals that allow you to see the best ending if you can find them all, and Gold Wings that enable you to skip ahead several rooms (six rooms, if I recall).  That begs the question- do I *want* to skip ahead?  The game's really fun, and I love a good challenge!  There's other collectibles that don't have much meaning and are just there for points.  There's also hidden rooms you may or may not find along the way.  So much to find if you want.  The extra lives are the important ones though.

If this is a puzzle game it might be one of the greatest puzzles on the NES.  However there's enough adventure that it's probably not a puzzle game in the true sense.  I'm not really sure.  That's for you to decide.  You're controlling a character in a similar fashion to other adventure games such as Milon's Secret Castle, so I think by default this automatically makes Solomon's Key not a true puzzle.

Is Solomon's Key *too* hard?  Yes, at times, but it's important to remember once you memorize the layout of a room, find the location of all the items and figure out the best way to get around, the challenge goes down.  Maybe not a lot since enemy danger is always looming, but at least a little.

The game's only disadvantage is that the replay value is a little on the low side.  Once you figure out the best way to obtain the key and reach the exit door, well the game's still fun thanks to the adventure elements and the constant barrage of enemy danger (certainly more replay than a normal puzzle game like Tetris in my opinion) but you won't be coming back to this game often.  Either the insane challenge or the fact you have to replay the same rooms over and over just to get back to the point you inevitably got stuck and had a game over lowers the replay.  Getting stuck on room 34 for example, and the hour or two it took to get that far, and then having to do the whole game over when you lose all your lives is NOT fun.  With that said though, you will feel rewarded each time you complete a room.  This is the only reason I'm not giving Solomon's Key 5 stars.  This game is really fun other than that.

U2 WOW  after so many years this game is still really good the controls are better  with a very rich variety of races to take on as well as an upgraded lists of cars , customization has been broadened too  and dare i say its BETTER than NFS2015 in terms of body customization but not detailing of course

Even though I bought it a year after release it had the same bugs that were never fixed. So being fed up with madden I did some research and stumbled upon this, which I never heard of at the time it was released. So I picked it up for 5 bucks at a local pre-owned game store. This game nails it. It's fun, it doesn't have a bunch of useless features and game modes. If I wanted to run a football franchise I'd get my MBA or something. But I just want to play a football game and this one delivers. So no need to for concession stand price settings and franchise mode for me. I have a full time job already.  Anyway, the graphics are good considering its from 2K8. The momentum of the players is perfect from how the QB drops back to how an LB comes up for a tackle. One of the announcer's voice is a bit shrill, but what they say is actually entertaining, relevant and much less monotonous that Madden. Play calling is good, and overall game mechanics/physics work perfectly.

Some might say the lack of NFL teams and current players makes this bad. But I think it's actually the best part. I stopped paying attention to the NFL after like 5th grade, so I don't even know who's on the teams now except the big names. What's cool about this game is you can have legends on your team. Elway, Marino, Montana, Barry Sanders, etc. They even made an attempt to make them look like them as well. It's not great, but you can tell Archie Manning from Steve Grogan. The other cool thing are the stadiums. Since they didn't have to replicate NFL stadiums they could be creative, and they came out pretty neat.

I don't know how Madden got so popular and obtained an exclusive NFL license, but it's the worst thing to happen to sports video games. I'll be playing this until 2k comes back and makes a new one.

Despite being titled Contra 4, the game feels more like an in-between title with Super C and Contra III. It doesn't quite stand at-level with Contra III's over-the-top nature, but it's certainly more advanced than the former title. The pea shooter makes its return in this game, which to be honest is the only minor thing I can criticize about this game. I don't care very much for it since I'm not the greatest at rapid-fire input on such small devices as the Nintendo DS; to add to it I've been rather spoiled with machine guns in Contra games pretty much since Contra III. It can make some situations feel pretty tight if you're not careful (I'm looking specifically at you, stage 7). Personally, I felt it more acceptable in the first two NES Contra games - which as a wonderful bonus is included in this game as unlockables. There's also the challenge mode for some additional set-course action including some objectives like destroying all the enemies or running pacifist through sections of a stage. It's also great to have the option for selecting which character you want to play as (including unlockable characters) so there's plenty to like about Contra 4. At its core, Contra 4 certainly fills the Contra bill quite nicely - you've also got all the returning weapons like the spread gun and laser, and quite interestingly the weapons can be upgraded twice much like the arcade port of Super Contra (grabbing one spread gun fires three waves of bullets, whereas two spread guns fire five waves and so forth). Let's top it all off with an awesome soundtrack from Jake Kaufman, who is responsible for some great video game remixes over the years, and couldn't fit better doing a soundtrack for a Contra game. I'd highly recommend this game for any owners of the NDS looking for a fun and difficult shoot 'em up to carry along with them.

5,False,"08 17, 2014",A1ZU6402AN5DPG,B001E7MMOK,DeltaPenguin,"I originally got this game from a sale when GameCrazy was going out of business.  I've played portions of and seen videos of some of the other games around this time by this company, Atelier Iris 1-3, but they didn't engage my interest per characters or story.  Since this was on sale, and I am a fan of RPGs, thought I'd give this game a go.

Aside from your talking cat companion Sylpher (spelling may be off, it's been awhile), cursing needlessly in the beginning, the game as I recall is pretty clean.  The focus is on alchemy, or item creation and material gathering.  While this can get monotonous at times, the item creation and customization is amazing.  I recall spending many hours creation items with the right traits I wanted to complete quests and boost my battle capability.

The story takes place in a school setting, where the main character and others are in school to learn alchemy.  The setting and scenarios that crop up all really fit well together in the fantasy/school setting, the characters are memorable and likable, the voice acting is top notch (I listened to English dub, I forget if it had Japanese dub).

The graphics are not as good as some modern day RPGs, going the 2D sprite route, but they are varied and overall fit the theme nicely and are well expressed.  I enjoyed the overall in-game 2D sprites.  The larger 2D character portraits are a bit lacking, I didn't like the art style as much as other games even when I played it ~3-4? years ago, but it's really the voice acting and character interactions that are the core of this experience.  I love the way the main character develops and watching all the quirky characters relate to each other.  The ending wraps everything together nicely, and based on the character events that are completed, you can get one character specific ending, which I thought were all superbly done (not too long, and very applicable to that character's personality).

That said, this is my favorite game from this company Gust, and it's at the top of my list of favorite RPGs.  I played a more recent entry from Gust recently, Atelier Meruru, and while it is great graphically, and the alchemy system was well done, the experience was not as good.  I'll write a review over there later.  All that to say, it's an older game and looks not as impressive as other games, but it's definitely worth a play through.",the game as I recall is pretty clean.

This is a Hidden Object game with a surrounding narrative that takes you through a story that gives you reasons for finding objects.  Every once in a while there are different kinds of puzzles to solve in order to progress.  The game has a few innovative features, such as side scrolling and zooming into and out of the picture.  I found the search difficulty to be medium to a little hard.  I did use hints a few times, mainly to understand what an object looked like since my image of what an object was did not always match the description.  There is no time limit so you can feel free to take as long as you like.

The Options screen has controls for music and effects volume, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any music or sound effects included on the disc.  The only sounds I heard were voices when characters were talking.  Otherwise, the game is silent while you're doing the puzzles, which is kind of boring.  At least the artwork is very nice.

Also, I ran across what I think is a bug in the game.  Pretty early on you find a box that requires you to solve a series of logic puzzles to open it.  I quickly figured out what had to be done, but one of the pieces would not present me with what I had determined to be the solution.  Since this puzzle is apparently randomly generated, I think it somehow generated a set that was not solveable.  Fortunately, there's a skip button.

On the whole, though the concept is interesting, I found the game to be too much talking and not enough puzzling, which makes the game feel really short.  (I finished it over a couple of afternoons.)  Once you're finished with the first pass you can play it again, supposedly with different things to find, and there's a free play mode where you can just do only searching for objects without sitting through the narrative.  Frankly, I have no interest in continuing to play this game.  For the most hidden object fun I recommend the Mystery Case Files and Mystery PI games.",Um...Yeah...Whatever,1268179200,6,,

WORTH OWNING FOR SPIDERMAN FANS: Honestly I have loved how they have designed different spidermen and different dimensions. Having an artbook that has arts depicting all the spidies and villians truly adds value to this overall bundle. Now if you are not a fan of the spiderman to begin with, this may not mean much to you, but if you are into spiderman you will like it a lot. The dimensions of the art book are the same as that of game case.

********REVIEW OF THE ACTUAL GAME************

I am a big fan of Spiderman and seeing how this game looked, I had to give it a shot. I mean comic book like artstyle, 4 different versions of Spiderman and worlds and variety of villains, got to check it out. After spending 16+ hrs on this game (finished on normal mode and unlocked almost everything), here is what I thought.

******************PROS******************

AMAZING ARTWORK OF 4 DIFFERENT SPIDERMEN AND 4 DIFFERENT UNIVERSES: This is the first and foremost thing you will notice if you are a Spiderman fan such as myself. They have done really good job animating 4 different versions of Spiderman (Spectacular Spiderman, Noir Spiderman, 2099 Spiderman and Ultimate Spiderman), 4 different worlds and most importantly villains in 4 different worlds. As you progress further and further into the game, you will get to experience more and more of this variety and chances are you will like what you see.

13+ VILLAINS OF SPIDERMAN UNIVERSE: To me, after artwork, this was the strongest aspect of the game. There are 14 different levels. First is just tutorial. Then the next 12 levels you have 12 different bosses with different powers. So each Spiderman gets 3 different bosses each and then all 4 of them get to defeat one final boss in level 13. The best part is each one of these bosses is very artistically animated and for most part there is some level of creativity and variety involved in boss battles. Loved it just loved it. If you are a Spiderman fan you should buy this game just for this.

VARIETY OF SPIDER POWERS AND MOVES: While all 4 spidies have shared set of abilities and fighting moves (web swinging, sticking to wall, punches and kicking in combination with web etc.), each one has distinct powers, style and looks. Amazing spidy will do a lot of web based attacks, Noir has more stealth based attacks, 2099 can slow down time while ultimate spidycan use unique rage ability of venom based suit. Noir stealth mode was especially quite impressive. Reminded me of Batman Arkam Asylum.

VARIETY IN GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS: While a lot of gameplay in 4 worlds share common redundancy in terms of beating thugs and then beating bigger thugs and saving some civilians before you face off with bosses, they all have some very different gameplay aspects. For example, in Noir world you will heavily have to rely on stealth and in 2099 you will be doing cool things like chasing bosses while gliding through futuristic cities. Happy they didn't make things too redundant.

INTERESTING FIRST PERSON HAND TO HAND COMBAT MODE: Each boss you face, there will face them in first person view mode where you get to give them a piece of your mind by punching, jabbing and uppercutting them. If a boss has given you hard time or annoyed you this is the time to let it all out. Furthermore, they also have some cutscenes where you dodge through enemy attacks in first person mode. I personally enjoyed it.

PLATHORA OF UPGRADES, COSTUMES AND UNLOCKABLE: Spiderman fans will love it. Every time you beat enemies you get experience points through which you can buy more moves, upgrade your abilities or buy costumes. This adds a lot to replay value to the game. Even after finishing it once (12+ hrs). This can get you to play it again and again. Some of the costumes you can unlock are pretty unique while others are just plain funny.

VIDEO, FIGURINE AND ART GALLERY: If you are like me, someone who doesn't like to play through the game 10 times just to enjoy some in game cutscene, this is the game for you. Completing the game will unlock different movie, art and figurine galleries. Big plus.

 DECENT VARIETY IN ENEMIES: Now this game doesn't have as much variety in enemies as God of War or Castlevania games, but I am happy to tell you enemies in different levels are still somewhat different. My biggest fear in Spiderman game is having the same enemies over and over again. While in this game in all levels you will be fighting goons and bigger goons, they have have different looks from level to level. Not only that you will also need to change your fighting strategy to overcome enemies in different levels. Salute to the creators.

*******************CONS********************

REDUNDANCY: I didn't mind it as much, but if you are someone who doesn't like redundancy in games, then you will mind this. As stated before, one type of redundancy you face is beating goons and then beating bigger goons in all levels. But the one that can really get on your nerves at time is saving civilians. Fortunately, for most part, it is not as bad as these civilians won't die easily if at all. And also we have to remember that this is a superhero game so I guess they had to push it in. Just wish didn't have to save civilians so often.

*******************CONCLUSION****************

So the game is not perfect, but if you are a Spiderman fan like me, you will surely enjoy it. I truly enjoyed playing as 4 different Spidermen with different powers in 4 different world. Unlockables truly kept me coming back for more. I would give it 9/10 and highly recommend it.",They pulled it off....

It's basically just 5 mini games in 1. 20,000 Leaks, River Rush, Rally Ball, Reflex Ridge and Space Pop. As you can probably tell from the artwork on the case, the game uses pre-made avatars as the characters in the game, though you're not able to use your own avatar which was somewhat disappointing. The main mode of the game is Adventure mode where you play a set number of mini games in order to get medals so that you can move on to the other levels. All of the mini games in the Adventure mode are the same, the only difference is the layout as well as the main goal. For instance, One level may have you collecting a certain number of pins while another level will require you to race through it in a set time limit. There are about 4 different difficulties in Adventure mode. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and The Ultimate Treasure. Each difficulty is locked until you beat the previous one. Beginner is almost like a tutorial letting you get a feel for things while all of the other ones challenge your reflexes and reaction speed. I only made it past the intermediate difficulty, but this game does give you a really good workout, and it's way more fun than walking on a boring treadmill. I just wish that it had more mini games included because the ones that are on there do get boring after a while.",Decent game.,1524268800,,,

There is just one thing I've run into that is, to this point, ruining it for me. At this point, I'm in the battle with Zorn, a robot you have a brush with at the first at the game and get away from. I've run thru trying to defeat him around 30 times and I get killed off each time no matter how many times I've checked out the ""how-it's-done"" videos, etc. This has cost this game a star. I've a number of really good games that were fun to play until you get to a ""boss"" that you can't beat. Then this messes up the whole game for you. I usually play my games first in ""easy"" mode as I've always had a lot of trouble finish a game the first time in ""normal"". I really like this game but placing boss fights that someone who just happens to have trouble winning boss fights in the easy mode of a game ruins it for me. I hope to be able to finish this game but the way it goods now, I won't get any further than Zorn........Such a shame as it is a good game.  EASY should mean you should be able finish the game!!!
 5/16/14: Update. OK, so it sometimes helps if you discover that your doing things wrong and when you do them right makes a BIG difference! I wasn't uses my weapons correctly on the Zorn fight. Once I found that out that fight was over in two times thru! You have two spammer type weapons you can use. One, uses ALL your power in one attack. The other (the LB aim, RB fire is a less powerful firing mode BUT it does damage and saves your power), so that when he gets his arm stuck, you have the power to use the LB aim, RT fire mode which does the most damage. If you just use the LB + RT approach only it just gives him the chance to regenerate and you'll soon get killed as you don't do enough damage and you can't dodge all his attacks..

After using this mouse for less than two weeks, it has become nearly useless.  The mouse stops working and freezes every few seconds.  I tested it with two laptops with the same results.  Unfortunately, this mouse is going into the garbage.

Original Review: This is a decent mouse, but not one I'd use for gaming.  It seems like more of a novelty item with the shifting, light-up colors.  It was fun to watch for a few minutes, but I could see it getting distracting after a while, especially if you use it in a darkened room.  And it does not appear that there is any way to turn it out.  (A manual might help, but that's not included.) The styling on the top of the mouse is also a bit gaudy-looking.

I use a Razer Death Adder for gaming, which I believe could be considered a mid-range gaming mouse.  Comparing the Klorts to that mouse, it's lacking.  It's made entirely of hard plastic, and it gets uncomfortable quite quickly, which is compounded by all of the sharp edges.  The scroll button doesn't move very easily, and when I try to scroll upward, my finger can just slide right across the surface of the button if I don't push hard enough.  The side buttons are also impractical.  They're quite narrow and are positioned near the top of the mouse and are hard to get to if you're trying to act quickly during a game.

If this was marketed as an everyday mouse, I might give it three stars.  But as a gaming mouse, two stars seem fair.

Note: I received a sample of this product for review.",Stopped working after less than two weeks.,1403308800,2,,

This is the Blathers Amiibo.  Like the other Amiibo, it's adorable, and here's how it works:

1) At some point after the ""Animal Crossing Welcome Amiibo"" update to your game, you'll hear a voice calling out to you.  Follow that voice and eventually you'll find an Aladdin-styled Genie lamp on the ground.  Pick it up and take it home.
2) Put the lamp out somewhere in your home and click on it.  A spirit will pop out who says he can 'possess' various characters in the game, if you have their Amiibo.  You'll be prompted to set the Amiibo on the touchscreen (and you'll want to have Wireless/NFC turned on).
3) The spirit will appear looking like the Amiibo character.  If you choose ""Let's hang out!"", he'll then possess them and make them leave their job and go hang out in the campground.  When this happens, you can go visit them in their RV and buy things from them.  Be aware this also means they'll be away from their posts!  Because this spirit has possessed them and convinced them to go take the day off.

Things return to normal the next day.  This makes a cute and fun add-on to the Animal Crossing game.  It's just a shame that Nintendo limits every Amiibo to specific individual titles--it would be more fun if you could use them across multiple games.",A cute figurine and fun add-on to Animal Crossing: New Leaf,1499385600,,,
